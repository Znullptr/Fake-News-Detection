## Overview

Fake news can manipulate the public for political, commercial, or other purposes by spreading deliberately distorted or false information. This project classifies news articles as fake or real using machine learning algorithms. The final solution is accessible via a web interface built using Flask, enabling users to validate news articles with a simple click.

### Objectives:
1. Classify news articles into "real" or "fake."
2. Implement advanced preprocessing techniques to improve model performance.
3. Deploy the model for public usage with an easy-to-use interface.
