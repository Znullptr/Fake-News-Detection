Aug 16 (Reuters) - The incongruous sight of tourists enjoying Maui's tropical beaches while search-and-rescue teams trawl building ruins and waters for victims of the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century has outraged some residents.

They have vented on social media, posting video of tourists enjoying holiday activities like snorkeling while the death toll in the historic resort town of Lahaina passes 100 and is rising every day.

""Our community needs time to heal, grieve, and restore,"" Hawaiian actor Jason Momoa said on Instagram, urging tourists to cancel their trips.

Authorities and businesses have welcomed the trickle of travelers, saying it will lessen the blow to the island's economy, which relies heavily on tourism. The industry is Maui's ""economic engine,"" generating 80% of its wealth, according to the island's economic development board.

As Maui embarks on a long, painful recovery from the fires, officials are wrestling with how to balance residents' immediate needs for housing and resources against the island's long-term financial health.

Hawaii Governor Josh Green recalled at a weekend press conference how the COVID-19 pandemic similarly forced the state to weigh the risks of allowing tourists in during a public health crisis against the harm Hawaii's economy would suffer from barring them.

""All of our people will need to survive, and we can't afford to have no jobs or no future for our children,"" Green said. ""When you restrict any travel to a region, you really devastate its own local residents in many ways more than anyone else.""

Tourism has taken a hit in the week since the wildfire devastated Lahaina, a popular vacation destination that was also home to historic sites significant to Hawaiian residents.

The number of airline passengers to Maui on Sunday was down nearly 81% compared to the same time last year, according to the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism.

In 2022, 2.9 million tourists visited Maui, which has a year-round population of 165,000, according to the latest numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau. The state tourism department reported in February that visitors spent $5.69 billion on Maui in 2022.

The Hawaii Tourism Authority now is asking visitors to avoid all non-essential travel to West Maui, the part of the island affected by the fires, so resources can be used to help locals recover.

“It is likely that a big chunk of the people who are affected, losing family members, losing family homes, it's likely a lot of them were employed by the visitor industry,"" tourism authority spokesperson Ilihia Gionson said.

Hotels in West Maui have temporarily stopped accepting bookings. Many are housing their employees and preparing to house evacuees and first-responders working on disaster recovery, according to the tourism authority.

The agency urged visitors to areas of Maui that did not burn - such as Kahului, Wailuku, Kihei, Wailea and Makena - to contact their accommodation and ensure they could still be hosted.

""Maui is not closed,"" Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said at the weekend press conference alongside the governor. ""Many of our residents make their living off of tourism.""

Reached by phone on Tuesday, the Four Seasons Resort at Wailea Beach in South Maui said all hotel operations were running normally, but that it was encouraging tourists with August reservations to postpone their trips until the rest of the island had recovered more fully.

Occupancy at the five-star hotel had plunged ""dramatically"" since the fire, a front desk operator said.

Hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings, which has 23 hotels throughout Hawaii, said it was waiving cancellation penalties for those traveling to, from or through all islands of Hawaii through Aug. 31.

Jack Richards, CEO of Los Angeles-based travel company Pleasant Holidays, scrambled to evacuate more than 400 customers who were on Maui during the fires. Dead phone lines and lost internet connections hampered the efforts, he said.

Most of the tourists were eventually relocated to other Hawaiian islands. Another 1,400 customers with August travel plans to Maui need to be rebooked, he said.

Tour operators who continued to offer services in or around West Maui after the fires faced a flood of criticism.

A company that held a charity snorkeling tour on Friday 11 miles (18 km) from Lahaina later issued an apology and said it was suspending operations for the time being.

Summary Armed marines boarded, inspected vessel on Sunday

Turkey's silence shows desire to revive UN grain deal

Erdogan invited Putin to visit this month for talks

Commercial worries that Black Sea grows more volatile

ISTANBUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russia's raid on a ship just off Turkey's coast brings the fallout from the Ukraine war to another NATO frontier and raises the stakes as Ankara seeks to coax Moscow back to a grain-export deal that would restore some calm to the Black Sea.

Armed marines raided the Turkish-based vessel via helicopter on Sunday some 60 km (37 miles) off Turkey's northwest coast, in international waters but near Istanbul, in what Moscow called an inspection before it sailed on to Ukraine.

Turkey, NATO's second-largest military, has made no public comment on the incident that occurred far south of the war that has raged for a year-and-a-half in the north Black Sea.

Analysts said it tests President Tayyip Erdogan's resolve to maintain good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he has invited to Turkey this month to discuss resuming the UN-brokered deal that had protected grain exports from Ukraine.

""This type of aggression being exercised so close to Istanbul went unchecked and doesn't respect Turkey's overall rights,"" said Yoruk Isik, an Istanbul-based geopolitical analyst at the Bosphorus Observer consultancy.

""Ankara's silence is strange but shows it is still counting on Putin to visit and return to the grain deal.""

Since Russia exited the agreement last month, both it and Ukraine have issued warnings and carried out attacks on vessels off their coasts, stirring worries that commercial-shipping could grow riskier across the entire sea.

While Ukraine and some other Western states have promoted alternative routes for Ukrainian exports, Ankara, which also has good relations with Kyiv, quietly opposes them on safety grounds. It wants the West to accept some Russian demands, and for Russia to drop others, to restart Ukraine grain exports under UN and Turkish oversight.

On Wednesday, Russia struck more Ukrainian port facilities even as Kyiv announced that a container ship departed Odesa under its own ""humanitarian corridor"", one of the alternative options.

Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, said on Wednesday it is in contact with all sides to return to the table though it was ""difficult"" partly given the recent bombardment of grain infrastructure.

FINE BALANCE

The Black Sea and Turkish straits are the main route Ukraine and Russia - two of the world's top agriculture producers - use to reach world markets.

Since the year-long grain deal collapsed, boosting global commodity prices and raising UN concerns over world hunger, Russia and Ukraine have said they will treat ships approaching the other's ports as potential military vessels.

Aydin Sezer, a former Turkish diplomat and Ankara-based foreign policy analyst, said Russia's inspection of the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan vessel technically took place in a war zone, given Moscow and Kyiv's warnings over ships.

Given Turkey has sent armed drones and other weapons to Ukraine while also claiming to be neutral in the war, ""it is very challenging for Turkey to find its voice on this matter,"" he said.

Turkey has positioned itself to facilitate any peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. It has opposed the Russian invasion but also the Western sanctions on Moscow, and ramped up economic cooperation with Russia through the war.

A Turkish defence ministry official, requesting anonymity, said Ankara was looking into the Black Sea raid but gave no more details. The vessel has since sailed on to Romanian waters, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Russia has not commented on a potential visit by Putin, though Turkey has promoted it repeatedly including in a leaders call on Aug. 2.

Russia has said it would return to the grain deal once the West fulfils obligations meant to ensure the smooth export of its own grain and fertilisers, including payments and logistics.

Sezer said its two key demands are including a Russian bank in the global SWIFT payments system and allowing it to import agriculture-related goods.

""Therefore Erdogan should negotiate and try to convince Western countries, not Putin, for the reinstatement of the grain deal,"" he said.

Ukraine reports new attack on grain silos but cargo ship sets sail,"Summary Cargo ship leaves Ukraine after being trapped since invasion

Departure is major test of Russia's threat to attack shipping

Ukraine says Russia has attacked grain infrastructure again

Ukrainian forces say they have captured another village

Russian officials consider reimposing capital controls

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine said Russia had attacked its grain storage facilities overnight, but a container ship left the Black Sea port of Odesa on Wednesday despite Moscow's threat to target shipping after it abandoned an export deal.

In the Russian capital, five sources said authorities were considering reimposing stringent capital controls as the rouble showed the strains of Russia's invasion of its neighbour, which has brought huge military spending and Western sanctions.

The departure from Odesa of the Hong-Kong-flagged Joseph Schulte, trapped in the port since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year, followed the latest Russian attack on the country's grain export infrastructure.

Overnight air strikes damaged silos and warehouses at Reni on the Danube river, a vital wartime route for food exports, Ukrainian officials said. They posted photos of destroyed storage facilities and piles of scattered grain and sunflowers.

There was no comment from Moscow. An industry source said the port was continuing operations, tempering a rise in benchmark wheat prices in Chicago off their two-month low.

Russia has made regular air strikes on Ukrainian ports and grain silos since mid-July, when it pulled out of the U.N.-backed deal for Ukraine to export grain.

Moscow has threatened to treat any ships leaving Ukraine as potential military targets and on Sunday its navy fired warning shots at a ship travelling towards Ukraine.

Despite the threats, Ukraine last week announced a ""humanitarian corridor"" in the Black Sea to release cargo ships that have been trapped in its ports by a de facto Russian blockade, pledging to make clear they were serving no military purpose.

""A first vessel used the temporary corridor for merchant ships to/from the ports of Big Odesa,"" Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Facebook.

Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), which owns the ship jointly with a Chinese bank, confirmed that the ship was en route to Istanbul.

Kubrakov said it was carrying more than 30,000 metric tons of cargo in 2,114 containers, adding that the corridor would primarily be used to evacuate ships from the Black Sea ports of Chornomorsk, Odesa and Pivdennyi.

Moscow has not indicated whether it would respect the shipping corridor, and shipping and insurance sources have expressed concerns about safety.

Ukraine is a major grain and oilseeds exporter and the United Nations says its supplies are vital to developing countries where hunger is a growing concern. Neither Kubrakov nor the shipping company specified the cargo on board the Joseph Schulte but grain is rarely carried in containers.

BATTLEFIELD GAIN

The attacks on Ukraine's grain followed its launch of a Western-backed counteroffensive in early June to try to dislodge Russian forces from territory they occupy in the south and east.

Extensive Russian fortifications and minefields along the front line have made it hard for Ukrainian forces to break through, but they announced they had retaken another village on Wednesday, the first settlement they have declared recaptured since June 27.

""Urozhaine liberated,"" Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram. ""Our defenders are entrenched on the outskirts.""

Ukrainian soldiers raised the country's flag above a broken war memorial in video released by the military and geolocated by Reuters to the village. It was not clear when it was filmed.

Russia's defence ministry did not confirm losing the settlement but said its artillery and war planes were attacking Ukrainian forces in the Urozhaine area.

The village's recapture would indicate Ukraine is pressing ahead with an offensive drive towards the Sea of Azov just over 90 km (55 miles) to the south, aiming to cut Russian forces occupying its southeastern coastline in half.

Inside Russia, the FSB security service said it had foiled an attempt by Ukrainian saboteurs to cross the border into Bryansk region for a second day in a row.

The conflict and accompanying sanctions have stretched Russia's finances, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates to 12% on Tuesday after the rouble dropped below 100 to the dollar. It firmed on Wednesday after the sources said officials were considering obliging exporters to sell their foreign currency revenues.

DANUBE PORTS

Ukraine turned to its Danube river ports after Russia pulled out of the international deal that had allowed Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea, seeking better terms for exports of its own food and fertilizer.

The river ports, which had accounted for around a quarter of grain exports, have since become the main route out for Ukrainian grain, which is also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Russia attacked Izmail - Ukraine's main inland port across the Danube River from Romania, sending global food prices higher as it ramped up its use of force to prevent Ukraine from exporting grain.

Turkey, which brokered the grain deal alongside the United Nations, has expressed hope that Russia will rejoin it this month.

A senior U.N. official emphasised that the deal was vital to stabilise food prices on global markets to protect the most vulnerable, saying all efforts were being made to restart it.

""It's difficult,"" Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development told a news conference in Nairobi. ""And obviously the bombardment of or shelling of grain infrastructure is not helping the markets.""

KYIV/KUPIANSK, Ukraine, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine announced the recapture of the village of Urozhaine from Russian troops in the southeast on Wednesday, but warned the situation on the northeastern front was deteriorating amid Russian counter-attacks.

Urozhaine, on the edge of Donetsk region, is the first village Kyiv says it has retaken since July 27, a sign of the challenge Ukraine faces advancing through heavily mined Russian defensive lines without powerful air support.

""Urozhaine is liberated,"" Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on the Telegram messaging app. ""Our defenders are entrenched on the outskirts.""

The village is one of several small rural settlements near the Mokri Yaly river that Ukraine has declared liberated since early June, when it launched a long-touted counteroffensive against Russian troops who occupy swathes of the south and east.

Its recapture would bring Kyiv closer to threatening the village of Staromlynivka, several kilometres to the south, which military analysts say is a Russian stronghold in the area.

Russia's defence ministry did not confirm losing Urozhaine in a statement on Telegram but said its artillery and warplanes were attacking Ukrainian forces in the Urozhaine area.

The village's recapture would indicate Ukraine is pressing ahead with an offensive drive south towards the Sea of Azov that aims to cut Russian occupying forces in half. Urozhaine lies just over 90 km (55 miles) from the Sea of Azov.

PRESSURE BUILDS IN NORTHEAST

Hours after the Urozhaine announcement, Oleksandr Syrskyi, one of Ukraine's top generals, said the situation on the Kupiansk front in the northeastern region of Kharkiv was growing more difficult.

Kupiansk, a town with a pre-war population of around 27,000, was seized by Russia in the early days of the February 2022 invasion before Ukrainian troops recaptured it in a lightning offensive last September that embarrassed Moscow.

""Due to the complication of the situation in the Kupiansk direction, I worked most of the day with units that lead the defence on the approaches to the city,"" Syrskyi was quoted as saying by Ukraine's Military Media Center.

""The enemy is trying to break through the defences of our troops every day, in different directions, with assault squads consisting mainly of convicts, with the aim of blockading and then capturing Kupiansk,"" he said.

Losing Kupiansk a second time would be a major blow to Kyiv's battlefield momentum at a time when its summer counter-offensive has so far failed to deliver significant territorial gains, except for villages such as Urozhaine.

Regional authorities announced a mandatory evacuation of civilians from near the Kupiansk front earlier this month due to daily Russian shelling.

""Our house is the only one standing, there are no other houses left intact around ours,"" said Oleh Yanytskyi, a resident of the village of Kurylivka who was evacuated by the Ukrainian Red Cross this week.

Kyiv says its counteroffensive is progressing slower than it wanted because of vast Russian minefields and prepared Russian defensive lines.

Russia controls nearly a fifth of Ukraine, including the peninsula of Crimea, most of Luhansk region and large tracts of the regions of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield reports.

Wildfire in Tenerife national park prompts village evacuations,"TENERIFE, Canary Islands, Spain, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A wildfire that broke out in a national park on the Spanish island of Tenerife has spread to 300 hectares, prompting authorities to order the evacuation of five villages and to cut off access to the forest surrounding the Mount Teide volcano.

The fire, which started on Tuesday night, was raging through a forested area in steep ravines in the northeastern part of Tenerife in the Canaries, making the firefighters' task more difficult.

""The fire is powerful and is in a complicated area,"" Canary Islands regional President Fernando Clavijo told a news conference in Tenerife.

""Efforts are focused on preventing the fire from spreading and affecting mainly residential areas close to the coast,"" he added.

About 10 helicopters dropping water and 150 firefighters and 50 military personnel were working to contain the wildfire that could take more than a day to bring under control, authorities said.

Early on Wednesday, the fire had devastated about 130 hectares (320 acres) near the Mount Teide volcano, Spain's highest peak. In a few hours, the fire has spread to over 300 hectares and there are many secondary fires, Pedro Martinez, head of Tenerife's emergency services, said.

The villages of Arrate, Chivisaya, Media Montaña, Ajafoña and Las Lagunetas have been evacuated, and local authorities said further measures would be taken during the day.

Rosa Davila, president of the Tenerife council, said all access to the mountains on the island has been closed and called on residents and visitors to keep out of the forest areas because of the risk the fire will spread further.

""We are doing this to prevent any incidents,"" Davila said.

During the last week, a heatwave in the Canary Islands has left many areas bone dry and increased the risk of wildfires.

This summer, firefighters have extinguished a series of forest fires on the islands of Gran Canaria and La Palma, which form part of the Canary Islands archipelago.

Tenerife's two airports were operating normally, according to Radio Canarias, which cited the Spanish airport operator Aena.

REUTERS/Lisi Niesner/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Germany's cabinet passed a contentious bill on Wednesday to legalize recreational marijuana use and cultivation, one of the most liberal cannabis laws in Europe that could potentially provide further momentum for a similar worldwide trend.

The legislation, which still has to pass parliament, would allow adults to possess up to 25 grams (0.88 oz) of the drug, grow a maximum of three plants, or acquire weed as associates of non-profit cannabis clubs.

The centre-left government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz hopes the law will curb the black market, protect consumers against contaminated marijuana and reduce drug-related crime.

A key pillar of the plan, which removes the taboo around cannabis use, is also a campaign to raise awareness about the risks, which should ultimately curb consumption, said Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD).

Such a campaign would not gain the same level of attention if it were introduced without a change in the law, he said.

""With the current procedures we could not seriously protect children and young people, the topic has been made a taboo,"" Lauterbach told a news conference in Berlin to present the law.

""We have rising, problematic consumption, we couldn't simply allow this to go on,"" he said. ""So this is an important turning point in our drug policy.""

The number of adults in Germany aged between 18 and 25 years old that consumed cannabis at least once nearly doubled in 2021 from the previous decade to 25%, according to the health ministry.

Young adults are considered more vulnerable to the health risks of cannabis. The new legislation will limit the amount of cannabis young adults can buy to 30 grams a month, compared to 50 grams for older adults.

CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES

Opposition to the legislation is fierce, with conservative policymakers in particular warning that it will encourage marijuana use and that the new legislation will create even more work for authorities.

""This law will be linked to a complete loss of control,"" Armin Schuster, conservative interior minister for the state of Saxony, told media group RND.

A U.N. narcotics watchdog said in March moves by governments to legalize the recreational use of marijuana have led to increased consumption and cannabis-related health problems.

Lauterbach said Germany had learned from other countries' mistakes, however.

Scholz's government had already watered down original plans to allow the widespread sale of cannabis in licensed shops after consultations with Brussels.

Instead, it said would launch a pilot project for a small number of licensed shops in some regions to test the effects of a commercial supply chain of recreational cannabis over five years. For that, it will need to present separate legislation in a second phase.

Similar such projects already exist or are planned in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Many countries in Europe have already legalised cannabis for limited medicinal purposes, including Germany since 2017. Others have decriminalized its general use.

Malta became the first European country to allow limited cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal use in late 2021. Germany would become the first major European country to do so.

The legislation presented on Wednesday includes strict rules for growing weed - cannabis clubs of up to 500 associates must have burglar-proof doors and windows, with greenhouses fenced off. Associates will not be allowed to smoke weed at the clubs or in the vicinity of schools, nurseries, playgrounds or sports grounds.

Germany's hemp association said the rules were ""unrealistic"" and the black market could only truly be fought with the introduction of cannabis sales in shops.

The parliamentary drug policy spokesperson of junior coalition partner the Free Democrats, Kristine Luetke, accused Lauterbach of continuing a ""prohibition policy"" and creating a ""bureaucratic monster"".

Factbox: Travis King: What happened to other U.S. soldiers who defected to North Korea?,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea on Wednesday confirmed it is holding U.S. Army Private Travis King after he crossed the border from South Korea last month while on a tour, but did not elaborate on what his future might hold.

State news agency KCNA said during an initial investigation that King confessed to illegally and deliberately crossing the border to escape mistreatment and racism in the army, and wants to stay in North Korea or another country.

Attempts by U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea to desert or defect to the authoritarian North are rare, but here are some cases that have occurred since the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty:

- Joseph T. White shot off the lock on a gate leading into the demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the Koreas while a U.S. soldier stationed in South Korea in 1982, before surrendering to North Korean troops, according to an account published by the Korea Times.

The North claimed he had defected, though Pyongyang refused a request by the United Nations Command to meet him. A U.S. military spokesman later said an investigation indicated that White crossed into North Korea of his own free will. In a video released by the North, White denounced the United States and praised North Korea and its then leader Kim Il-Sung.

White's parents later received a handwritten letter believed to be from their son, in which he said he was working as a teacher and happy in the North, the Washington Post reported. White drowned in a swimming accident in the North in 1985, according to a media report, citing information received by his parents.

- Charles Robert Jenkins walked into North Korea when on patrol on the DMZ in 1965. He later expressed regret for fleeing and explained at his court marital that his motive was to avoid hazardous duty in South Korea and combat in Vietnam. Jenkins said he had drunk 10 beers before the incident.

During his near four decades in the North, he taught English and also portrayed a U.S. spy in a propaganda film. Jenkins married Hitomi Soga, a Japanese woman abducted by Pyongyang. Soga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002 and Jenkins joined her with their two daughters in 2004. Jenkins died in 2017.

- James Joseph Dresnok was a 21-year old U.S. army private stationed in South Korea in 1962 when he fled to the North. Facing a court martial for skipping duty, Dresnok describes in a film about his life how he bolted across the DMZ, through a minefield.

Dresnok and three fellow American military defectors including Jenkins, Jerry Wayne Parrish and Larry Allen Abshier lived in relative isolation for years before becoming stars of North Korean cinema by depicting evil Americans in propaganda movies promoted by then leader Kim Jong-Il. Reports, citing Dresnok's sons, say he died in Pyongyang in 2016.

MOSCOW, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russia's lunar spacecraft entered the moon's orbit on Wednesday, a major step towards the country's ambition of being the first to land on the moon's south pole in the search for frozen water.

The Luna-25 entered the moon's orbit at 11:57 a.m. (0857 GMT), Russia's space corporate Roskosmos said.

Luna-25 will circle the moon, the earth's only natural satellite, for around 5 days, then change course for a soft landing on the lunar south pole planned for Aug. 21.

India's Chandrayaan-3 entered the moon's orbit earlier this month ahead of a planned touchdown on the south pole of the moon later this month.

The Luna-25, which is roughly the size of a small car, will aim to operate for a year on the south pole, where scientists at NASA and other space agencies in recent years have detected traces of frozen water in the craters.

The presence of water on the moon has implications for major space powers, potentially allowing longer human sojourns on the planet that would enable the mining of lunar resources.

No Russian spacecraft has entered lunar orbit since Luna-24, the Soviet Union's 1976 moon mission, according to Anatoly Zak, the creator and publisher of www.RussianSpaceWeb.com which tracks Russian space programmes.

""Entering lunar orbit is absolutely critical for the success of this project,"" Zak told Reuters. ""This is a first for the post-Soviet period.""

""Some are calling this the second lunar race so it is very important for Russia to resume this programme. Luna-25 is not just one mission - it is part of a much broader Russian strategy that stretches 10 years into the future.""

Travis King: who is the US soldier who crossed into North Korea?,"U.S. Private Travis T. King (wearing a black shirt and black cap) is seen in this picture taken during a tour of the tightly controlled Joint Security Area (JSA) on the border between the two Koreas, at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea, July 18, 2023. Sarah Leslie/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that it is holding American soldier Travis King, saying he crossed the border last month to escape racism and mistreatment in the U.S. military and society.

WHO IS PRIVATE KING?

Private Travis T. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, is a cavalry scout with the Korean Rotational Force, which is part of the U.S. security commitment to South Korea.

He was assigned to an element of the U.S. 1st Armored Division and was now administratively attached to a unit in 4th Infantry Division, a U.S. army spokesperson said.

His record includes routine awards such as the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal and Overseas Service Ribbon.

His family is from Racine, Wisconsin.

WHY DID HE CROSS TO NORTH KOREA AND WHERE IS HE NOW?

King's motivation and exact location remain unconfirmed.

He ""harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and wanted to stay in the North or a third country because he was ""disillusioned at the unequal American society,"" according to North Korean state news agency KCNA.

KCNA said he was held by the North Korean army after he crossed, but did not elaborate.

The Pentagon on Tuesday said that it could not verify King's alleged comments, but that it was working through all channels to bring him home.

King's uncle, Myron Gates, told ABC News in August that his nephew, who is Black, had experienced racism during his military deployment, and after he spent time in a South Korean jail, he did not sound like himself.

Another uncle, Carl Gates, told the Daily Beast his nephew had been ""breaking down"" after the death of a 7-year-old cousin this year.

HOW DID HE GET TO THE BORDER?

King had served nearly two months in detention in South Korea and was being escorted to Seoul's Incheon International Airport to fly home and face probable disciplinary action. But he never made it to his plane.

He had passed alone through security to his gate at the airport, where he told American Airlines staff that he lost his passport, an airport official told Reuters.

Escorted by an airline worker with the approval of a South Korean justice ministry official, King left the boarding zone and was seen exiting through a departure gate.

The next day King joined a bus tour of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice.

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BORDER?

Roughly 24 hours after leaving the airport, he sprinted into North Korea while touring the Joint Security Area, which sits astride the border.

Sarah Leslie, a tourist from New Zealand who was on the tour with King, said she saw him suddenly run across the border as U.S. and South Korean troops tried to stop him.

""I probably only saw him running for like a few seconds and that's all it would have taken to get across the border,"" she said.

WHAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS HE FACING?

Two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been due to face U.S. military disciplinary action, without saying what the action was linked to.

A South Korean court ruling said King pleaded guilty to assault and destruction of public goods stemming from an incident in October and on Feb. 8 the Seoul Western District Court fined him 5 million won ($4,000).

He faced two allegations of assault, and pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents.

King spent time in a South Korean prison, however, in lieu of paying the fine.

Erdogan invited Putin to visit this month for talks

Commercial worries that Black Sea grows more volatile

ISTANBUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russia's raid on a ship just off Turkey's coast brings the fallout from the Ukraine war to another NATO frontier and raises the stakes as Ankara seeks to coax Moscow back to a grain-export deal that would restore some calm to the Black Sea.

Armed marines raided the Turkish-based vessel via helicopter on Sunday some 60 km (37 miles) off Turkey's northwest coast, in international waters but near Istanbul, in what Moscow called an inspection before it sailed on to Ukraine.

Turkey, NATO's second-largest military, has made no public comment on the incident that occurred far south of the war that has raged for a year-and-a-half in the north Black Sea.

Analysts said it tests President Tayyip Erdogan's resolve to maintain good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he has invited to Turkey this month to discuss resuming the UN-brokered deal that had protected grain exports from Ukraine.

""This type of aggression being exercised so close to Istanbul went unchecked and doesn't respect Turkey's overall rights,"" said Yoruk Isik, an Istanbul-based geopolitical analyst at the Bosphorus Observer consultancy.

""Ankara's silence is strange but shows it is still counting on Putin to visit and return to the grain deal.""

Since Russia exited the agreement last month, both it and Ukraine have issued warnings and carried out attacks on vessels off their coasts, stirring worries that commercial-shipping could grow riskier across the entire sea.

While Ukraine and some other Western states have promoted alternative routes for Ukrainian exports, Ankara, which also has good relations with Kyiv, quietly opposes them on safety grounds. It wants the West to accept some Russian demands, and for Russia to drop others, to restart Ukraine grain exports under UN and Turkish oversight.

On Wednesday, Russia struck more Ukrainian port facilities even as Kyiv announced that a container ship departed Odesa under its own ""humanitarian corridor"", one of the alternative options.

Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, said on Wednesday it is in contact with all sides to return to the table though it was ""difficult"" partly given the recent bombardment of grain infrastructure.

FINE BALANCE

The Black Sea and Turkish straits are the main route Ukraine and Russia - two of the world's top agriculture producers - use to reach world markets.

Since the year-long grain deal collapsed, boosting global commodity prices and raising UN concerns over world hunger, Russia and Ukraine have said they will treat ships approaching the other's ports as potential military vessels.

Aydin Sezer, a former Turkish diplomat and Ankara-based foreign policy analyst, said Russia's inspection of the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan vessel technically took place in a war zone, given Moscow and Kyiv's warnings over ships.

Given Turkey has sent armed drones and other weapons to Ukraine while also claiming to be neutral in the war, ""it is very challenging for Turkey to find its voice on this matter,"" he said.

Turkey has positioned itself to facilitate any peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. It has opposed the Russian invasion but also the Western sanctions on Moscow, and ramped up economic cooperation with Russia through the war.

A Turkish defence ministry official, requesting anonymity, said Ankara was looking into the Black Sea raid but gave no more details. The vessel has since sailed on to Romanian waters, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Russia has not commented on a potential visit by Putin, though Turkey has promoted it repeatedly including in a leaders call on Aug. 2.

Russia has said it would return to the grain deal once the West fulfils obligations meant to ensure the smooth export of its own grain and fertilisers, including payments and logistics.

Sezer said its two key demands are including a Russian bank in the global SWIFT payments system and allowing it to import agriculture-related goods.

""Therefore Erdogan should negotiate and try to convince Western countries, not Putin, for the reinstatement of the grain deal,"" he said.

Ukraine reports new attack on grain silos but cargo ship sets sail,"Summary Cargo ship leaves Ukraine after being trapped since invasion

Departure is major test of Russia's threat to attack shipping

Ukraine says Russia has attacked grain infrastructure again

Ukrainian forces say they have captured another village

Russian officials consider reimposing capital controls

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine said Russia had attacked its grain storage facilities overnight, but a container ship left the Black Sea port of Odesa on Wednesday despite Moscow's threat to target shipping after it abandoned an export deal.

In the Russian capital, five sources said authorities were considering reimposing stringent capital controls as the rouble showed the strains of Russia's invasion of its neighbour, which has brought huge military spending and Western sanctions.

The departure from Odesa of the Hong-Kong-flagged Joseph Schulte, trapped in the port since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year, followed the latest Russian attack on the country's grain export infrastructure.

Overnight air strikes damaged silos and warehouses at Reni on the Danube river, a vital wartime route for food exports, Ukrainian officials said. They posted photos of destroyed storage facilities and piles of scattered grain and sunflowers.

There was no comment from Moscow. An industry source said the port was continuing operations, tempering a rise in benchmark wheat prices in Chicago off their two-month low.

Russia has made regular air strikes on Ukrainian ports and grain silos since mid-July, when it pulled out of the U.N.-backed deal for Ukraine to export grain.

Moscow has threatened to treat any ships leaving Ukraine as potential military targets and on Sunday its navy fired warning shots at a ship travelling towards Ukraine.

Despite the threats, Ukraine last week announced a ""humanitarian corridor"" in the Black Sea to release cargo ships that have been trapped in its ports by a de facto Russian blockade, pledging to make clear they were serving no military purpose.

""A first vessel used the temporary corridor for merchant ships to/from the ports of Big Odesa,"" Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Facebook.

Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), which owns the ship jointly with a Chinese bank, confirmed that the ship was en route to Istanbul.

Kubrakov said it was carrying more than 30,000 metric tons of cargo in 2,114 containers, adding that the corridor would primarily be used to evacuate ships from the Black Sea ports of Chornomorsk, Odesa and Pivdennyi.

Moscow has not indicated whether it would respect the shipping corridor, and shipping and insurance sources have expressed concerns about safety.

Ukraine is a major grain and oilseeds exporter and the United Nations says its supplies are vital to developing countries where hunger is a growing concern. Neither Kubrakov nor the shipping company specified the cargo on board the Joseph Schulte but grain is rarely carried in containers.

The attacks on Ukraine's grain followed its launch of a Western-backed counteroffensive in early June to try to dislodge Russian forces from territory they occupy in the south and east.

Extensive Russian fortifications and minefields along the front line have made it hard for Ukrainian forces to break through, but they announced they had retaken another village on Wednesday, the first settlement they have declared recaptured since June 27.

""Urozhaine liberated,"" Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram. ""Our defenders are entrenched on the outskirts.""

Ukrainian soldiers raised the country's flag above a broken war memorial in video released by the military and geolocated by Reuters to the village. It was not clear when it was filmed.

Russia's defence ministry did not confirm losing the settlement but said its artillery and war planes were attacking Ukrainian forces in the Urozhaine area.

The village's recapture would indicate Ukraine is pressing ahead with an offensive drive towards the Sea of Azov just over 90 km (55 miles) to the south, aiming to cut Russian forces occupying its southeastern coastline in half.

Inside Russia, the FSB security service said it had foiled an attempt by Ukrainian saboteurs to cross the border into Bryansk region for a second day in a row.

The conflict and accompanying sanctions have stretched Russia's finances, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates to 12% on Tuesday after the rouble dropped below 100 to the dollar. It firmed on Wednesday after the sources said officials were considering obliging exporters to sell their foreign currency revenues.

DANUBE PORTS

Ukraine turned to its Danube river ports after Russia pulled out of the international deal that had allowed Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea, seeking better terms for exports of its own food and fertilizer.

The river ports, which had accounted for around a quarter of grain exports, have since become the main route out for Ukrainian grain, which is also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Russia attacked Izmail - Ukraine's main inland port across the Danube River from Romania, sending global food prices higher as it ramped up its use of force to prevent Ukraine from exporting grain.

Turkey, which brokered the grain deal alongside the United Nations, has expressed hope that Russia will rejoin it this month.

A senior U.N. official emphasised that the deal was vital to stabilise food prices on global markets to protect the most vulnerable, saying all efforts were being made to restart it.

""It's difficult,"" Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development told a news conference in Nairobi. ""And obviously the bombardment of or shelling of grain infrastructure is not helping the markets.""

KYIV/KUPIANSK, Ukraine, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine announced the recapture of the village of Urozhaine from Russian troops in the southeast on Wednesday, but warned the situation on the northeastern front was deteriorating amid Russian counter-attacks.

Urozhaine, on the edge of Donetsk region, is the first village Kyiv says it has retaken since July 27, a sign of the challenge Ukraine faces advancing through heavily mined Russian defensive lines without powerful air support.

""Urozhaine is liberated,"" Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on the Telegram messaging app. ""Our defenders are entrenched on the outskirts.""

The village is one of several small rural settlements near the Mokri Yaly river that Ukraine has declared liberated since early June, when it launched a long-touted counteroffensive against Russian troops who occupy swathes of the south and east.

Its recapture would bring Kyiv closer to threatening the village of Staromlynivka, several kilometres to the south, which military analysts say is a Russian stronghold in the area.

Russia's defence ministry did not confirm losing Urozhaine in a statement on Telegram but said its artillery and warplanes were attacking Ukrainian forces in the Urozhaine area.

The village's recapture would indicate Ukraine is pressing ahead with an offensive drive south towards the Sea of Azov that aims to cut Russian occupying forces in half. Urozhaine lies just over 90 km (55 miles) from the Sea of Azov.

PRESSURE BUILDS IN NORTHEAST

Hours after the Urozhaine announcement, Oleksandr Syrskyi, one of Ukraine's top generals, said the situation on the Kupiansk front in the northeastern region of Kharkiv was growing more difficult.

Kupiansk, a town with a pre-war population of around 27,000, was seized by Russia in the early days of the February 2022 invasion before Ukrainian troops recaptured it in a lightning offensive last September that embarrassed Moscow.

""Due to the complication of the situation in the Kupiansk direction, I worked most of the day with units that lead the defence on the approaches to the city,"" Syrskyi was quoted as saying by Ukraine's Military Media Center.

""The enemy is trying to break through the defences of our troops every day, in different directions, with assault squads consisting mainly of convicts, with the aim of blockading and then capturing Kupiansk,"" he said.

Losing Kupiansk a second time would be a major blow to Kyiv's battlefield momentum at a time when its summer counter-offensive has so far failed to deliver significant territorial gains, except for villages such as Urozhaine.

Regional authorities announced a mandatory evacuation of civilians from near the Kupiansk front earlier this month due to daily Russian shelling.

""Our house is the only one standing, there are no other houses left intact around ours,"" said Oleh Yanytskyi, a resident of the village of Kurylivka who was evacuated by the Ukrainian Red Cross this week.

Kyiv says its counteroffensive is progressing slower than it wanted because of vast Russian minefields and prepared Russian defensive lines.

Russia controls nearly a fifth of Ukraine, including the peninsula of Crimea, most of Luhansk region and large tracts of the regions of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield reports.

Wildfire in Tenerife national park prompts village evacuations,"TENERIFE, Canary Islands, Spain, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A wildfire that broke out in a national park on the Spanish island of Tenerife has spread to 300 hectares, prompting authorities to order the evacuation of five villages and to cut off access to the forest surrounding the Mount Teide volcano.

The fire, which started on Tuesday night, was raging through a forested area in steep ravines in the northeastern part of Tenerife in the Canaries, making the firefighters' task more difficult.

""The fire is powerful and is in a complicated area,"" Canary Islands regional President Fernando Clavijo told a news conference in Tenerife.

""Efforts are focused on preventing the fire from spreading and affecting mainly residential areas close to the coast,"" he added.

About 10 helicopters dropping water and 150 firefighters and 50 military personnel were working to contain the wildfire that could take more than a day to bring under control, authorities said.

Early on Wednesday, the fire had devastated about 130 hectares (320 acres) near the Mount Teide volcano, Spain's highest peak. In a few hours, the fire has spread to over 300 hectares and there are many secondary fires, Pedro Martinez, head of Tenerife's emergency services, said.

The villages of Arrate, Chivisaya, Media Montaña, Ajafoña and Las Lagunetas have been evacuated, and local authorities said further measures would be taken during the day.

Rosa Davila, president of the Tenerife council, said all access to the mountains on the island has been closed and called on residents and visitors to keep out of the forest areas because of the risk the fire will spread further.

""We are doing this to prevent any incidents,"" Davila said.

During the last week, a heatwave in the Canary Islands has left many areas bone dry and increased the risk of wildfires.

This summer, firefighters have extinguished a series of forest fires on the islands of Gran Canaria and La Palma, which form part of the Canary Islands archipelago.

Tenerife's two airports were operating normally, according to Radio Canarias, which cited the Spanish airport operator Aena.

REUTERS/Lisi Niesner/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Germany's cabinet passed a contentious bill on Wednesday to legalize recreational marijuana use and cultivation, one of the most liberal cannabis laws in Europe that could potentially provide further momentum for a similar worldwide trend.

The legislation, which still has to pass parliament, would allow adults to possess up to 25 grams (0.88 oz) of the drug, grow a maximum of three plants, or acquire weed as associates of non-profit cannabis clubs.

The centre-left government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz hopes the law will curb the black market, protect consumers against contaminated marijuana and reduce drug-related crime.

A key pillar of the plan, which removes the taboo around cannabis use, is also a campaign to raise awareness about the risks, which should ultimately curb consumption, said Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD).

Such a campaign would not gain the same level of attention if it were introduced without a change in the law, he said.

""With the current procedures we could not seriously protect children and young people, the topic has been made a taboo,"" Lauterbach told a news conference in Berlin to present the law.

""We have rising, problematic consumption, we couldn't simply allow this to go on,"" he said. ""So this is an important turning point in our drug policy.""

The number of adults in Germany aged between 18 and 25 years old that consumed cannabis at least once nearly doubled in 2021 from the previous decade to 25%, according to the health ministry.

Young adults are considered more vulnerable to the health risks of cannabis. The new legislation will limit the amount of cannabis young adults can buy to 30 grams a month, compared to 50 grams for older adults.

CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES

Opposition to the legislation is fierce, with conservative policymakers in particular warning that it will encourage marijuana use and that the new legislation will create even more work for authorities.

""This law will be linked to a complete loss of control,"" Armin Schuster, conservative interior minister for the state of Saxony, told media group RND.

A U.N. narcotics watchdog said in March moves by governments to legalize the recreational use of marijuana have led to increased consumption and cannabis-related health problems.

Lauterbach said Germany had learned from other countries' mistakes, however.

Scholz's government had already watered down original plans to allow the widespread sale of cannabis in licensed shops after consultations with Brussels.

Instead, it said would launch a pilot project for a small number of licensed shops in some regions to test the effects of a commercial supply chain of recreational cannabis over five years. For that, it will need to present separate legislation in a second phase.

Similar such projects already exist or are planned in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Many countries in Europe have already legalised cannabis for limited medicinal purposes, including Germany since 2017. Others have decriminalized its general use.

Malta became the first European country to allow limited cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal use in late 2021. Germany would become the first major European country to do so.

The legislation presented on Wednesday includes strict rules for growing weed - cannabis clubs of up to 500 associates must have burglar-proof doors and windows, with greenhouses fenced off. Associates will not be allowed to smoke weed at the clubs or in the vicinity of schools, nurseries, playgrounds or sports grounds.

Germany's hemp association said the rules were ""unrealistic"" and the black market could only truly be fought with the introduction of cannabis sales in shops.

The parliamentary drug policy spokesperson of junior coalition partner the Free Democrats, Kristine Luetke, accused Lauterbach of continuing a ""prohibition policy"" and creating a ""bureaucratic monster"".

Factbox: Travis King: What happened to other U.S. soldiers who defected to North Korea?,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea on Wednesday confirmed it is holding U.S. Army Private Travis King after he crossed the border from South Korea last month while on a tour, but did not elaborate on what his future might hold.

State news agency KCNA said during an initial investigation that King confessed to illegally and deliberately crossing the border to escape mistreatment and racism in the army, and wants to stay in North Korea or another country.

Attempts by U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea to desert or defect to the authoritarian North are rare, but here are some cases that have occurred since the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty:

- Joseph T. White shot off the lock on a gate leading into the demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the Koreas while a U.S. soldier stationed in South Korea in 1982, before surrendering to North Korean troops, according to an account published by the Korea Times.

The North claimed he had defected, though Pyongyang refused a request by the United Nations Command to meet him. A U.S. military spokesman later said an investigation indicated that White crossed into North Korea of his own free will. In a video released by the North, White denounced the United States and praised North Korea and its then leader Kim Il-Sung.

White's parents later received a handwritten letter believed to be from their son, in which he said he was working as a teacher and happy in the North, the Washington Post reported. White drowned in a swimming accident in the North in 1985, according to a media report, citing information received by his parents.

- Charles Robert Jenkins walked into North Korea when on patrol on the DMZ in 1965. He later expressed regret for fleeing and explained at his court marital that his motive was to avoid hazardous duty in South Korea and combat in Vietnam. Jenkins said he had drunk 10 beers before the incident.

During his near four decades in the North, he taught English and also portrayed a U.S. spy in a propaganda film. Jenkins married Hitomi Soga, a Japanese woman abducted by Pyongyang. Soga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002 and Jenkins joined her with their two daughters in 2004. Jenkins died in 2017.

- James Joseph Dresnok was a 21-year old U.S. army private stationed in South Korea in 1962 when he fled to the North. Facing a court martial for skipping duty, Dresnok describes in a film about his life how he bolted across the DMZ, through a minefield.

Dresnok and three fellow American military defectors including Jenkins, Jerry Wayne Parrish and Larry Allen Abshier lived in relative isolation for years before becoming stars of North Korean cinema by depicting evil Americans in propaganda movies promoted by then leader Kim Jong-Il. Reports, citing Dresnok's sons, say he died in Pyongyang in 2016.

MOSCOW, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russia's lunar spacecraft entered the moon's orbit on Wednesday, a major step towards the country's ambition of being the first to land on the moon's south pole in the search for frozen water.

The Luna-25 entered the moon's orbit at 11:57 a.m. (0857 GMT), Russia's space corporate Roskosmos said.

Luna-25 will circle the moon, the earth's only natural satellite, for around 5 days, then change course for a soft landing on the lunar south pole planned for Aug. 21.

India's Chandrayaan-3 entered the moon's orbit earlier this month ahead of a planned touchdown on the south pole of the moon later this month.

The Luna-25, which is roughly the size of a small car, will aim to operate for a year on the south pole, where scientists at NASA and other space agencies in recent years have detected traces of frozen water in the craters.

The presence of water on the moon has implications for major space powers, potentially allowing longer human sojourns on the planet that would enable the mining of lunar resources.

No Russian spacecraft has entered lunar orbit since Luna-24, the Soviet Union's 1976 moon mission, according to Anatoly Zak, the creator and publisher of www.RussianSpaceWeb.com which tracks Russian space programmes.

""Entering lunar orbit is absolutely critical for the success of this project,"" Zak told Reuters. ""This is a first for the post-Soviet period.""

""Some are calling this the second lunar race so it is very important for Russia to resume this programme. Luna-25 is not just one mission - it is part of a much broader Russian strategy that stretches 10 years into the future.""

Travis King: who is the US soldier who crossed into North Korea?,"U.S. Private Travis T.

Sarah Leslie/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that it is holding American soldier Travis King, saying he crossed the border last month to escape racism and mistreatment in the U.S. military and society.

WHO IS PRIVATE KING?

Private Travis T. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, is a cavalry scout with the Korean Rotational Force, which is part of the U.S. security commitment to South Korea.

He was assigned to an element of the U.S. 1st Armored Division and was now administratively attached to a unit in 4th Infantry Division, a U.S. army spokesperson said.

His record includes routine awards such as the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal and Overseas Service Ribbon.

His family is from Racine, Wisconsin.

WHY DID HE CROSS TO NORTH KOREA AND WHERE IS HE NOW?

King's motivation and exact location remain unconfirmed.

He ""harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and wanted to stay in the North or a third country because he was ""disillusioned at the unequal American society,"" according to North Korean state news agency KCNA.

KCNA said he was held by the North Korean army after he crossed, but did not elaborate.

The Pentagon on Tuesday said that it could not verify King's alleged comments, but that it was working through all channels to bring him home.

King's uncle, Myron Gates, told ABC News in August that his nephew, who is Black, had experienced racism during his military deployment, and after he spent time in a South Korean jail, he did not sound like himself.

Another uncle, Carl Gates, told the Daily Beast his nephew had been ""breaking down"" after the death of a 7-year-old cousin this year.

HOW DID HE GET TO THE BORDER?

King had served nearly two months in detention in South Korea and was being escorted to Seoul's Incheon International Airport to fly home and face probable disciplinary action. But he never made it to his plane.

He had passed alone through security to his gate at the airport, where he told American Airlines staff that he lost his passport, an airport official told Reuters.

Escorted by an airline worker with the approval of a South Korean justice ministry official, King left the boarding zone and was seen exiting through a departure gate.

The next day King joined a bus tour of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice.

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BORDER?

Roughly 24 hours after leaving the airport, he sprinted into North Korea while touring the Joint Security Area, which sits astride the border.

Sarah Leslie, a tourist from New Zealand who was on the tour with King, said she saw him suddenly run across the border as U.S. and South Korean troops tried to stop him.

""I probably only saw him running for like a few seconds and that's all it would have taken to get across the border,"" she said.

WHAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS HE FACING?

Two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been due to face U.S. military disciplinary action, without saying what the action was linked to.

A South Korean court ruling said King pleaded guilty to assault and destruction of public goods stemming from an incident in October and on Feb. 8 the Seoul Western District Court fined him 5 million won ($4,000).

He faced two allegations of assault, and pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents.

King spent time in a South Korean prison, however, in lieu of paying the fine.

Inside Russia, the FSB security service said it had foiled an attempt by Ukrainian saboteurs to cross the border into Bryansk region for a second day in a row.

The conflict and accompanying sanctions have stretched Russia's finances, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates to 12% on Tuesday after the rouble dropped below 100 to the dollar. It firmed on Wednesday after the sources said officials were considering obliging exporters to sell their foreign currency revenues.

DANUBE PORTS

Ukraine turned to its Danube river ports after Russia pulled out of the international deal that had allowed Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea, seeking better terms for exports of its own food and fertilizer.

The river ports, which had accounted for around a quarter of grain exports, have since become the main route out for Ukrainian grain, which is also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Russia attacked Izmail - Ukraine's main inland port across the Danube River from Romania, sending global food prices higher as it ramped up its use of force to prevent Ukraine from exporting grain.

Turkey, which brokered the grain deal alongside the United Nations, has expressed hope that Russia will rejoin it this month.

A senior U.N. official emphasised that the deal was vital to stabilise food prices on global markets to protect the most vulnerable, saying all efforts were being made to restart it.

""It's difficult,"" Rebeca Grynspan, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development told a news conference in Nairobi. ""And obviously the bombardment of or shelling of grain infrastructure is not helping the markets.""

Ukraine retakes village but warns of trouble in northeast - Kyiv,"[1/2] Ukrainian soldiers stand with Ukrainian flag in Urozhaine, Donetsk Region, Ukraine in this screen grab obtained from a handout video released on August 16, 2023. 35th Separate Marines Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces/via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights

KYIV/KUPIANSK, Ukraine, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine announced the recapture of the village of Urozhaine from Russian troops in the southeast on Wednesday, but warned the situation on the northeastern front was deteriorating amid Russian counter-attacks.

Urozhaine, on the edge of Donetsk region, is the first village Kyiv says it has retaken since July 27, a sign of the challenge Ukraine faces advancing through heavily mined Russian defensive lines without powerful air support.

""Urozhaine is liberated,"" Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on the Telegram messaging app. ""Our defenders are entrenched on the outskirts.""

The village is one of several small rural settlements near the Mokri Yaly river that Ukraine has declared liberated since early June, when it launched a long-touted counteroffensive against Russian troops who occupy swathes of the south and east.

Its recapture would bring Kyiv closer to threatening the village of Staromlynivka, several kilometres to the south, which military analysts say is a Russian stronghold in the area.

Russia's defence ministry did not confirm losing Urozhaine in a statement on Telegram but said its artillery and warplanes were attacking Ukrainian forces in the Urozhaine area.

The village's recapture would indicate Ukraine is pressing ahead with an offensive drive south towards the Sea of Azov that aims to cut Russian occupying forces in half. Urozhaine lies just over 90 km (55 miles) from the Sea of Azov.

PRESSURE BUILDS IN NORTHEAST

Hours after the Urozhaine announcement, Oleksandr Syrskyi, one of Ukraine's top generals, said the situation on the Kupiansk front in the northeastern region of Kharkiv was growing more difficult.

Kupiansk, a town with a pre-war population of around 27,000, was seized by Russia in the early days of the February 2022 invasion before Ukrainian troops recaptured it in a lightning offensive last September that embarrassed Moscow.

""Due to the complication of the situation in the Kupiansk direction, I worked most of the day with units that lead the defence on the approaches to the city,"" Syrskyi was quoted as saying by Ukraine's Military Media Center.

""The enemy is trying to break through the defences of our troops every day, in different directions, with assault squads consisting mainly of convicts, with the aim of blockading and then capturing Kupiansk,"" he said.

Losing Kupiansk a second time would be a major blow to Kyiv's battlefield momentum at a time when its summer counter-offensive has so far failed to deliver significant territorial gains, except for villages such as Urozhaine.

Regional authorities announced a mandatory evacuation of civilians from near the Kupiansk front earlier this month due to daily Russian shelling.

""Our house is the only one standing, there are no other houses left intact around ours,"" said Oleh Yanytskyi, a resident of the village of Kurylivka who was evacuated by the Ukrainian Red Cross this week.

Kyiv says its counteroffensive is progressing slower than it wanted because of vast Russian minefields and prepared Russian defensive lines.

Russia controls nearly a fifth of Ukraine, including the peninsula of Crimea, most of Luhansk region and large tracts of the regions of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield reports.

Wildfire in Tenerife national park prompts village evacuations,"TENERIFE, Canary Islands, Spain, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A wildfire that broke out in a national park on the Spanish island of Tenerife has spread to 300 hectares, prompting authorities to order the evacuation of five villages and to cut off access to the forest surrounding the Mount Teide volcano.

The fire, which started on Tuesday night, was raging through a forested area in steep ravines in the northeastern part of Tenerife in the Canaries, making the firefighters' task more difficult.

""The fire is powerful and is in a complicated area,"" Canary Islands regional President Fernando Clavijo told a news conference in Tenerife.

""Efforts are focused on preventing the fire from spreading and affecting mainly residential areas close to the coast,"" he added.

About 10 helicopters dropping water and 150 firefighters and 50 military personnel were working to contain the wildfire that could take more than a day to bring under control, authorities said.

Early on Wednesday, the fire had devastated about 130 hectares (320 acres) near the Mount Teide volcano, Spain's highest peak. In a few hours, the fire has spread to over 300 hectares and there are many secondary fires, Pedro Martinez, head of Tenerife's emergency services, said.

The villages of Arrate, Chivisaya, Media Montaña, Ajafoña and Las Lagunetas have been evacuated, and local authorities said further measures would be taken during the day.

Rosa Davila, president of the Tenerife council, said all access to the mountains on the island has been closed and called on residents and visitors to keep out of the forest areas because of the risk the fire will spread further.

""We are doing this to prevent any incidents,"" Davila said.

During the last week, a heatwave in the Canary Islands has left many areas bone dry and increased the risk of wildfires.

This summer, firefighters have extinguished a series of forest fires on the islands of Gran Canaria and La Palma, which form part of the Canary Islands archipelago.

Tenerife's two airports were operating normally, according to Radio Canarias, which cited the Spanish airport operator Aena.

REUTERS/Lisi Niesner/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Germany's cabinet passed a contentious bill on Wednesday to legalize recreational marijuana use and cultivation, one of the most liberal cannabis laws in Europe that could potentially provide further momentum for a similar worldwide trend.

The legislation, which still has to pass parliament, would allow adults to possess up to 25 grams (0.88 oz) of the drug, grow a maximum of three plants, or acquire weed as associates of non-profit cannabis clubs.

The centre-left government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz hopes the law will curb the black market, protect consumers against contaminated marijuana and reduce drug-related crime.

A key pillar of the plan, which removes the taboo around cannabis use, is also a campaign to raise awareness about the risks, which should ultimately curb consumption, said Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD).

Such a campaign would not gain the same level of attention if it were introduced without a change in the law, he said.

""With the current procedures we could not seriously protect children and young people, the topic has been made a taboo,"" Lauterbach told a news conference in Berlin to present the law.

""We have rising, problematic consumption, we couldn't simply allow this to go on,"" he said. ""So this is an important turning point in our drug policy.""

The number of adults in Germany aged between 18 and 25 years old that consumed cannabis at least once nearly doubled in 2021 from the previous decade to 25%, according to the health ministry.

Young adults are considered more vulnerable to the health risks of cannabis. The new legislation will limit the amount of cannabis young adults can buy to 30 grams a month, compared to 50 grams for older adults.

CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES

Opposition to the legislation is fierce, with conservative policymakers in particular warning that it will encourage marijuana use and that the new legislation will create even more work for authorities.

""This law will be linked to a complete loss of control,"" Armin Schuster, conservative interior minister for the state of Saxony, told media group RND.

A U.N. narcotics watchdog said in March moves by governments to legalize the recreational use of marijuana have led to increased consumption and cannabis-related health problems.

Lauterbach said Germany had learned from other countries' mistakes, however.

Scholz's government had already watered down original plans to allow the widespread sale of cannabis in licensed shops after consultations with Brussels.

Instead, it said would launch a pilot project for a small number of licensed shops in some regions to test the effects of a commercial supply chain of recreational cannabis over five years. For that, it will need to present separate legislation in a second phase.

Similar such projects already exist or are planned in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Many countries in Europe have already legalised cannabis for limited medicinal purposes, including Germany since 2017. Others have decriminalized its general use.

Malta became the first European country to allow limited cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal use in late 2021. Germany would become the first major European country to do so.

The legislation presented on Wednesday includes strict rules for growing weed - cannabis clubs of up to 500 associates must have burglar-proof doors and windows, with greenhouses fenced off. Associates will not be allowed to smoke weed at the clubs or in the vicinity of schools, nurseries, playgrounds or sports grounds.

Germany's hemp association said the rules were ""unrealistic"" and the black market could only truly be fought with the introduction of cannabis sales in shops.

The parliamentary drug policy spokesperson of junior coalition partner the Free Democrats, Kristine Luetke, accused Lauterbach of continuing a ""prohibition policy"" and creating a ""bureaucratic monster"".

Factbox: Travis King: What happened to other U.S. soldiers who defected to North Korea?,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea on Wednesday confirmed it is holding U.S. Army Private Travis King after he crossed the border from South Korea last month while on a tour, but did not elaborate on what his future might hold.

State news agency KCNA said during an initial investigation that King confessed to illegally and deliberately crossing the border to escape mistreatment and racism in the army, and wants to stay in North Korea or another country.

Attempts by U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea to desert or defect to the authoritarian North are rare, but here are some cases that have occurred since the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty:

- Joseph T. White shot off the lock on a gate leading into the demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the Koreas while a U.S. soldier stationed in South Korea in 1982, before surrendering to North Korean troops, according to an account published by the Korea Times.

The North claimed he had defected, though Pyongyang refused a request by the United Nations Command to meet him. A U.S. military spokesman later said an investigation indicated that White crossed into North Korea of his own free will. In a video released by the North, White denounced the United States and praised North Korea and its then leader Kim Il-Sung.

White's parents later received a handwritten letter believed to be from their son, in which he said he was working as a teacher and happy in the North, the Washington Post reported. White drowned in a swimming accident in the North in 1985, according to a media report, citing information received by his parents.

- Charles Robert Jenkins walked into North Korea when on patrol on the DMZ in 1965. He later expressed regret for fleeing and explained at his court marital that his motive was to avoid hazardous duty in South Korea and combat in Vietnam. Jenkins said he had drunk 10 beers before the incident.

During his near four decades in the North, he taught English and also portrayed a U.S. spy in a propaganda film. Jenkins married Hitomi Soga, a Japanese woman abducted by Pyongyang. Soga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002 and Jenkins joined her with their two daughters in 2004. Jenkins died in 2017.

- James Joseph Dresnok was a 21-year old U.S. army private stationed in South Korea in 1962 when he fled to the North. Facing a court martial for skipping duty, Dresnok describes in a film about his life how he bolted across the DMZ, through a minefield.

Dresnok and three fellow American military defectors including Jenkins, Jerry Wayne Parrish and Larry Allen Abshier lived in relative isolation for years before becoming stars of North Korean cinema by depicting evil Americans in propaganda movies promoted by then leader Kim Jong-Il. Reports, citing Dresnok's sons, say he died in Pyongyang in 2016.

MOSCOW, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russia's lunar spacecraft entered the moon's orbit on Wednesday, a major step towards the country's ambition of being the first to land on the moon's south pole in the search for frozen water.

The Luna-25 entered the moon's orbit at 11:57 a.m. (0857 GMT), Russia's space corporate Roskosmos said.

Luna-25 will circle the moon, the earth's only natural satellite, for around 5 days, then change course for a soft landing on the lunar south pole planned for Aug. 21.

India's Chandrayaan-3 entered the moon's orbit earlier this month ahead of a planned touchdown on the south pole of the moon later this month.

The Luna-25, which is roughly the size of a small car, will aim to operate for a year on the south pole, where scientists at NASA and other space agencies in recent years have detected traces of frozen water in the craters.

The presence of water on the moon has implications for major space powers, potentially allowing longer human sojourns on the planet that would enable the mining of lunar resources.

No Russian spacecraft has entered lunar orbit since Luna-24, the Soviet Union's 1976 moon mission, according to Anatoly Zak, the creator and publisher of www.RussianSpaceWeb.com which tracks Russian space programmes.

""Entering lunar orbit is absolutely critical for the success of this project,"" Zak told Reuters. ""This is a first for the post-Soviet period.""

""Some are calling this the second lunar race so it is very important for Russia to resume this programme. Luna-25 is not just one mission - it is part of a much broader Russian strategy that stretches 10 years into the future.""

Travis King: who is the US soldier who crossed into North Korea?,"U.S. Private Travis T. King (wearing a black shirt and black cap) is seen in this picture taken during a tour of the tightly controlled Joint Security Area (JSA) on the border between the two Koreas, at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea, July 18, 2023. Sarah Leslie/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that it is holding American soldier Travis King, saying he crossed the border last month to escape racism and mistreatment in the U.S. military and society.

WHO IS PRIVATE KING?

Private Travis T. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, is a cavalry scout with the Korean Rotational Force, which is part of the U.S. security commitment to South Korea.

He was assigned to an element of the U.S. 1st Armored Division and was now administratively attached to a unit in 4th Infantry Division, a U.S. army spokesperson said.

His record includes routine awards such as the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal and Overseas Service Ribbon.

His family is from Racine, Wisconsin.

WHY DID HE CROSS TO NORTH KOREA AND WHERE IS HE NOW?

King's motivation and exact location remain unconfirmed.

He ""harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and wanted to stay in the North or a third country because he was ""disillusioned at the unequal American society,"" according to North Korean state news agency KCNA.

KCNA said he was held by the North Korean army after he crossed, but did not elaborate.

The Pentagon on Tuesday said that it could not verify King's alleged comments, but that it was working through all channels to bring him home.

King's uncle, Myron Gates, told ABC News in August that his nephew, who is Black, had experienced racism during his military deployment, and after he spent time in a South Korean jail, he did not sound like himself.

Another uncle, Carl Gates, told the Daily Beast his nephew had been ""breaking down"" after the death of a 7-year-old cousin this year.

HOW DID HE GET TO THE BORDER?

King had served nearly two months in detention in South Korea and was being escorted to Seoul's Incheon International Airport to fly home and face probable disciplinary action. But he never made it to his plane.

He had passed alone through security to his gate at the airport, where he told American Airlines staff that he lost his passport, an airport official told Reuters.

Escorted by an airline worker with the approval of a South Korean justice ministry official, King left the boarding zone and was seen exiting through a departure gate.

The next day King joined a bus tour of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice.

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BORDER?

Roughly 24 hours after leaving the airport, he sprinted into North Korea while touring the Joint Security Area, which sits astride the border.

Sarah Leslie, a tourist from New Zealand who was on the tour with King, said she saw him suddenly run across the border as U.S. and South Korean troops tried to stop him.

""I probably only saw him running for like a few seconds and that's all it would have taken to get across the border,"" she said.

WHAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS HE FACING?

Two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been due to face U.S. military disciplinary action, without saying what the action was linked to.

A South Korean court ruling said King pleaded guilty to assault and destruction of public goods stemming from an incident in October and on Feb. 8 the Seoul Western District Court fined him 5 million won ($4,000).

He faced two allegations of assault, and pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents.

King spent time in a South Korean prison, however, in lieu of paying the fine.

SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Singapore police have arrested 10 foreigners for alleged money laundering and forgery offences, in a case involving about S$1 billion ($737 million) of cash, properties, luxury cars and other assets.

The police conducted simultaneous raids on Tuesday across the city-state to arrest the suspects, their statement said on Wednesday.

Prohibition of disposal orders were issued against 94 properties and 50 vehicles, with a total estimated value of more than S$815 million.

Other seizures included bank accounts, cash, luxury bags, jewellery, watches, electronic devices and some documents with information on virtual assets.

The foreigners were aged between 31 and 44, and their nationalities include Chinese, Turkish, Cypriot, Cambodian and Ni-Vanuatu, Singapore police said.

In a separate statement, the Singapore central bank said it has been ""in touch with the financial institutions (FIs) where the potentially tainted funds have been identified. Supervisory engagements with these FIs are ongoing"", without naming the FIs.

"Pakistan crowd vandalises churches, torches homes after two accused of blasphemy","LAHORE, Pakistan, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan on Wednesday, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran, police and community leaders said.

The attack took place in Jaranwala in the industrial district of Faisalabad, police spokesman Naveed Ahmad said. The two Christians were accused of blasphemy, he said, adding they and family members had fled their homes.

Resident Shakil Masih said he heard announcements inciting the mob and then saw crowds heading towards his Christian area.

""I left my home immediately with my family. Several other families did the same,"" he told Reuters.

The area has been cordoned off as police negotiated with the crowd, provincial police chief Usman Anwar told English Dawn.com online publication.

The police case against the two Christians is that they found pages of the Koran with some derogatory remarks written in red.

Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan and though no one has ever been executed for it, numerous accused people have been lynched by outraged crowds.

A former provincial governor and a minister for minorities have also been shot dead because of blasphemy accusations.

Rights groups say accusations of blasphemy are also misused to settle scores. Hundreds of people are languishing in prison after being accused as judges often put off trials, fearing retribution if they are seen as being too lenient, they say.

""The frequency and scale of such attacks — which are systematic, violent and often uncontainable — appear to have increased in the last several years,"" said the Human Rights Commision of Pakistan.

The rights group called for the setting up and equipping of special police forces to protect religious minorities’ sites of worship as directed by the 2014 Supreme Court judgment.

Caretaker Prime Minister Anwar ul Haq Kakar called for stern action against those responsible for Wednesday's violence. ""I am gutted by the visuals coming out,"" he said.

Hundreds of people blocked a nearby highway to protest against the alleged desecration of the Koran.

A Christian leader, Akmal Bhatti, said the crowd had ""torched"" at least five churches and looted valuables from houses that had been abandoned by their owners.

Several social media posts showed some churches, houses and belongings on fire as police stood by.

The mob was made up of thousands of people led by local clerics, mainly from an Islamist political party called Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), a government source said.

The TLP, however, denied inciting the violence and said it had worked with police to try to calm things down.

Instead, it said would launch a pilot project for a small number of licensed shops in some regions to test the effects of a commercial supply chain of recreational cannabis over five years. For that, it will need to present separate legislation in a second phase.

Similar such projects already exist or are planned in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Many countries in Europe have already legalised cannabis for limited medicinal purposes, including Germany since 2017. Others have decriminalized its general use.

Malta became the first European country to allow limited cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal use in late 2021. Germany would become the first major European country to do so.

The legislation presented on Wednesday includes strict rules for growing weed - cannabis clubs of up to 500 associates must have burglar-proof doors and windows, with greenhouses fenced off. Associates will not be allowed to smoke weed at the clubs or in the vicinity of schools, nurseries, playgrounds or sports grounds.

Germany's hemp association said the rules were ""unrealistic"" and the black market could only truly be fought with the introduction of cannabis sales in shops.

The parliamentary drug policy spokesperson of junior coalition partner the Free Democrats, Kristine Luetke, accused Lauterbach of continuing a ""prohibition policy"" and creating a ""bureaucratic monster"".

Factbox: Travis King: What happened to other U.S. soldiers who defected to North Korea?,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea on Wednesday confirmed it is holding U.S. Army Private Travis King after he crossed the border from South Korea last month while on a tour, but did not elaborate on what his future might hold.

State news agency KCNA said during an initial investigation that King confessed to illegally and deliberately crossing the border to escape mistreatment and racism in the army, and wants to stay in North Korea or another country.

Attempts by U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea to desert or defect to the authoritarian North are rare, but here are some cases that have occurred since the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty:

- Joseph T. White shot off the lock on a gate leading into the demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the Koreas while a U.S. soldier stationed in South Korea in 1982, before surrendering to North Korean troops, according to an account published by the Korea Times.

The North claimed he had defected, though Pyongyang refused a request by the United Nations Command to meet him. A U.S. military spokesman later said an investigation indicated that White crossed into North Korea of his own free will. In a video released by the North, White denounced the United States and praised North Korea and its then leader Kim Il-Sung.

White's parents later received a handwritten letter believed to be from their son, in which he said he was working as a teacher and happy in the North, the Washington Post reported. White drowned in a swimming accident in the North in 1985, according to a media report, citing information received by his parents.

- Charles Robert Jenkins walked into North Korea when on patrol on the DMZ in 1965. He later expressed regret for fleeing and explained at his court marital that his motive was to avoid hazardous duty in South Korea and combat in Vietnam. Jenkins said he had drunk 10 beers before the incident.

During his near four decades in the North, he taught English and also portrayed a U.S. spy in a propaganda film. Jenkins married Hitomi Soga, a Japanese woman abducted by Pyongyang. Soga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002 and Jenkins joined her with their two daughters in 2004. Jenkins died in 2017.

- James Joseph Dresnok was a 21-year old U.S. army private stationed in South Korea in 1962 when he fled to the North. Facing a court martial for skipping duty, Dresnok describes in a film about his life how he bolted across the DMZ, through a minefield.

Dresnok and three fellow American military defectors including Jenkins, Jerry Wayne Parrish and Larry Allen Abshier lived in relative isolation for years before becoming stars of North Korean cinema by depicting evil Americans in propaganda movies promoted by then leader Kim Jong-Il. Reports, citing Dresnok's sons, say he died in Pyongyang in 2016.

MOSCOW, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russia's lunar spacecraft entered the moon's orbit on Wednesday, a major step towards the country's ambition of being the first to land on the moon's south pole in the search for frozen water.

The Luna-25 entered the moon's orbit at 11:57 a.m. (0857 GMT), Russia's space corporate Roskosmos said.

Luna-25 will circle the moon, the earth's only natural satellite, for around 5 days, then change course for a soft landing on the lunar south pole planned for Aug. 21.

India's Chandrayaan-3 entered the moon's orbit earlier this month ahead of a planned touchdown on the south pole of the moon later this month.

The Luna-25, which is roughly the size of a small car, will aim to operate for a year on the south pole, where scientists at NASA and other space agencies in recent years have detected traces of frozen water in the craters.

The presence of water on the moon has implications for major space powers, potentially allowing longer human sojourns on the planet that would enable the mining of lunar resources.

No Russian spacecraft has entered lunar orbit since Luna-24, the Soviet Union's 1976 moon mission, according to Anatoly Zak, the creator and publisher of www.RussianSpaceWeb.com which tracks Russian space programmes.

""Entering lunar orbit is absolutely critical for the success of this project,"" Zak told Reuters. ""This is a first for the post-Soviet period.""

""Some are calling this the second lunar race so it is very important for Russia to resume this programme. Luna-25 is not just one mission - it is part of a much broader Russian strategy that stretches 10 years into the future.""

Travis King: who is the US soldier who crossed into North Korea?,"U.S. Private Travis T. King (wearing a black shirt and black cap) is seen in this picture taken during a tour of the tightly controlled Joint Security Area (JSA) on the border between the two Koreas, at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea, July 18, 2023. Sarah Leslie/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that it is holding American soldier Travis King, saying he crossed the border last month to escape racism and mistreatment in the U.S. military and society.

WHO IS PRIVATE KING?

Private Travis T. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, is a cavalry scout with the Korean Rotational Force, which is part of the U.S. security commitment to South Korea.

He was assigned to an element of the U.S. 1st Armored Division and was now administratively attached to a unit in 4th Infantry Division, a U.S. army spokesperson said.

His record includes routine awards such as the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal and Overseas Service Ribbon.

His family is from Racine, Wisconsin.

WHY DID HE CROSS TO NORTH KOREA AND WHERE IS HE NOW?

King's motivation and exact location remain unconfirmed.

He ""harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and wanted to stay in the North or a third country because he was ""disillusioned at the unequal American society,"" according to North Korean state news agency KCNA.

KCNA said he was held by the North Korean army after he crossed, but did not elaborate.

The Pentagon on Tuesday said that it could not verify King's alleged comments, but that it was working through all channels to bring him home.

King's uncle, Myron Gates, told ABC News in August that his nephew, who is Black, had experienced racism during his military deployment, and after he spent time in a South Korean jail, he did not sound like himself.

Another uncle, Carl Gates, told the Daily Beast his nephew had been ""breaking down"" after the death of a 7-year-old cousin this year.

HOW DID HE GET TO THE BORDER?

King had served nearly two months in detention in South Korea and was being escorted to Seoul's Incheon International Airport to fly home and face probable disciplinary action. But he never made it to his plane.

He had passed alone through security to his gate at the airport, where he told American Airlines staff that he lost his passport, an airport official told Reuters.

Escorted by an airline worker with the approval of a South Korean justice ministry official, King left the boarding zone and was seen exiting through a departure gate.

The next day King joined a bus tour of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice.

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BORDER?

Roughly 24 hours after leaving the airport, he sprinted into North Korea while touring the Joint Security Area, which sits astride the border.

Sarah Leslie, a tourist from New Zealand who was on the tour with King, said she saw him suddenly run across the border as U.S. and South Korean troops tried to stop him.

""I probably only saw him running for like a few seconds and that's all it would have taken to get across the border,"" she said.

WHAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS HE FACING?

Two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been due to face U.S. military disciplinary action, without saying what the action was linked to.

A South Korean court ruling said King pleaded guilty to assault and destruction of public goods stemming from an incident in October and on Feb. 8 the Seoul Western District Court fined him 5 million won ($4,000).

He faced two allegations of assault, and pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents.

King spent time in a South Korean prison, however, in lieu of paying the fine.

SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Singapore police have arrested 10 foreigners for alleged money laundering and forgery offences, in a case involving about S$1 billion ($737 million) of cash, properties, luxury cars and other assets.

The police conducted simultaneous raids on Tuesday across the city-state to arrest the suspects, their statement said on Wednesday.

Prohibition of disposal orders were issued against 94 properties and 50 vehicles, with a total estimated value of more than S$815 million.

Other seizures included bank accounts, cash, luxury bags, jewellery, watches, electronic devices and some documents with information on virtual assets.

The foreigners were aged between 31 and 44, and their nationalities include Chinese, Turkish, Cypriot, Cambodian and Ni-Vanuatu, Singapore police said.

In a separate statement, the Singapore central bank said it has been ""in touch with the financial institutions (FIs) where the potentially tainted funds have been identified. Supervisory engagements with these FIs are ongoing"", without naming the FIs.

"Pakistan crowd vandalises churches, torches homes after two accused of blasphemy","LAHORE, Pakistan, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan on Wednesday, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran, police and community leaders said.

The attack took place in Jaranwala in the industrial district of Faisalabad, police spokesman Naveed Ahmad said. The two Christians were accused of blasphemy, he said, adding they and family members had fled their homes.

Resident Shakil Masih said he heard announcements inciting the mob and then saw crowds heading towards his Christian area.

""I left my home immediately with my family. Several other families did the same,"" he told Reuters.

The area has been cordoned off as police negotiated with the crowd, provincial police chief Usman Anwar told English Dawn.com online publication.

The police case against the two Christians is that they found pages of the Koran with some derogatory remarks written in red.

Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan and though no one has ever been executed for it, numerous accused people have been lynched by outraged crowds.

A former provincial governor and a minister for minorities have also been shot dead because of blasphemy accusations.

Rights groups say accusations of blasphemy are also misused to settle scores. Hundreds of people are languishing in prison after being accused as judges often put off trials, fearing retribution if they are seen as being too lenient, they say.

""The frequency and scale of such attacks — which are systematic, violent and often uncontainable — appear to have increased in the last several years,"" said the Human Rights Commision of Pakistan.

The rights group called for the setting up and equipping of special police forces to protect religious minorities’ sites of worship as directed by the 2014 Supreme Court judgment.

Caretaker Prime Minister Anwar ul Haq Kakar called for stern action against those responsible for Wednesday's violence. ""I am gutted by the visuals coming out,"" he said.

Hundreds of people blocked a nearby highway to protest against the alleged desecration of the Koran.

A Christian leader, Akmal Bhatti, said the crowd had ""torched"" at least five churches and looted valuables from houses that had been abandoned by their owners.

Several social media posts showed some churches, houses and belongings on fire as police stood by.

The mob was made up of thousands of people led by local clerics, mainly from an Islamist political party called Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), a government source said.

The TLP, however, denied inciting the violence and said it had worked with police to try to calm things down.

Lithuania closes two Belarus border crossings,"VILNIUS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Lithuanian government said on Wednesday it had decided to close two of the country's six border crossing points with Belarus due to ""geopolitical circumstances"", weeks after Russian Wagner Group mercenaries took refuge in the country.

The government did not spell out the circumstances nor threats in its reasoning for closing from Friday the two rural crossing points, which were not used by commercial vehicles.

Over the previous few weeks Lithuanian officials have discouraged its citizens from travelling to Belarus, a close Russian ally, setting up signs at the borders saying: ""Do not risk your safety – do not travel to Belarus. You may fail to come back"".

Neighbouring Poland has closed all but one border crossing point with Belarus this year following the imprisonment of a journalist of Polish origin and expulsions of Polish diplomats.

Latvia, the third EU country bordering Belarus, has two operational crossings.

Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the border on Tuesday, after nearly 100 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross from Belarus in 24 hours.

Poland announced plans last week to move 10,000 additional troops to the Belarus border to support existing guards.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, began crossing from Belarus. They eventually resorted to pushing them back, a policy that is still in place.

The migrants keep appearing at the borders, in significantly smaller numbers.

Wildfire in Tenerife national park prompts village evacuations,"TENERIFE, Canary Islands, Spain, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A wildfire that broke out in a national park on the Spanish island of Tenerife has spread to 300 hectares, prompting authorities to order the evacuation of five villages and to cut off access to the forest surrounding the Mount Teide volcano.

The fire, which started on Tuesday night, was raging through a forested area in steep ravines in the northeastern part of Tenerife in the Canaries, making the firefighters' task more difficult.

""The fire is powerful and is in a complicated area,"" Canary Islands regional President Fernando Clavijo told a news conference in Tenerife.

""Efforts are focused on preventing the fire from spreading and affecting mainly residential areas close to the coast,"" he added.

About 10 helicopters dropping water and 150 firefighters and 50 military personnel were working to contain the wildfire that could take more than a day to bring under control, authorities said.

Early on Wednesday, the fire had devastated about 130 hectares (320 acres) near the Mount Teide volcano, Spain's highest peak. In a few hours, the fire has spread to over 300 hectares and there are many secondary fires, Pedro Martinez, head of Tenerife's emergency services, said.

The villages of Arrate, Chivisaya, Media Montaña, Ajafoña and Las Lagunetas have been evacuated, and local authorities said further measures would be taken during the day.

Rosa Davila, president of the Tenerife council, said all access to the mountains on the island has been closed and called on residents and visitors to keep out of the forest areas because of the risk the fire will spread further.

""We are doing this to prevent any incidents,"" Davila said.

During the last week, a heatwave in the Canary Islands has left many areas bone dry and increased the risk of wildfires.

This summer, firefighters have extinguished a series of forest fires on the islands of Gran Canaria and La Palma, which form part of the Canary Islands archipelago.

Tenerife's two airports were operating normally, according to Radio Canarias, which cited the Spanish airport operator Aena.

REUTERS/Lisi Niesner/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Germany's cabinet passed a contentious bill on Wednesday to legalize recreational marijuana use and cultivation, one of the most liberal cannabis laws in Europe that could potentially provide further momentum for a similar worldwide trend.

The legislation, which still has to pass parliament, would allow adults to possess up to 25 grams (0.88 oz) of the drug, grow a maximum of three plants, or acquire weed as associates of non-profit cannabis clubs.

The centre-left government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz hopes the law will curb the black market, protect consumers against contaminated marijuana and reduce drug-related crime.

A key pillar of the plan, which removes the taboo around cannabis use, is also a campaign to raise awareness about the risks, which should ultimately curb consumption, said Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD).

Such a campaign would not gain the same level of attention if it were introduced without a change in the law, he said.

""With the current procedures we could not seriously protect children and young people, the topic has been made a taboo,"" Lauterbach told a news conference in Berlin to present the law.

""We have rising, problematic consumption, we couldn't simply allow this to go on,"" he said. ""So this is an important turning point in our drug policy.""

The number of adults in Germany aged between 18 and 25 years old that consumed cannabis at least once nearly doubled in 2021 from the previous decade to 25%, according to the health ministry.

Young adults are considered more vulnerable to the health risks of cannabis. The new legislation will limit the amount of cannabis young adults can buy to 30 grams a month, compared to 50 grams for older adults.

CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES

Opposition to the legislation is fierce, with conservative policymakers in particular warning that it will encourage marijuana use and that the new legislation will create even more work for authorities.

""This law will be linked to a complete loss of control,"" Armin Schuster, conservative interior minister for the state of Saxony, told media group RND.

A U.N. narcotics watchdog said in March moves by governments to legalize the recreational use of marijuana have led to increased consumption and cannabis-related health problems.

Lauterbach said Germany had learned from other countries' mistakes, however.

Scholz's government had already watered down original plans to allow the widespread sale of cannabis in licensed shops after consultations with Brussels.

Instead, it said would launch a pilot project for a small number of licensed shops in some regions to test the effects of a commercial supply chain of recreational cannabis over five years. For that, it will need to present separate legislation in a second phase.

Similar such projects already exist or are planned in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Many countries in Europe have already legalised cannabis for limited medicinal purposes, including Germany since 2017. Others have decriminalized its general use.

Malta became the first European country to allow limited cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal use in late 2021. Germany would become the first major European country to do so.

Associates will not be allowed to smoke weed at the clubs or in the vicinity of schools, nurseries, playgrounds or sports grounds.

SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that it is holding American soldier Travis King, saying he crossed the border last month to escape racism and mistreatment in the U.S. military and society.

""I left my home immediately with my family. Several other families did the same,"" he told Reuters.

The area has been cordoned off as police negotiated with the crowd, provincial police chief Usman Anwar told English Dawn.com online publication.

The police case against the two Christians is that they found pages of the Koran with some derogatory remarks written in red.

Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan and though no one has ever been executed for it, numerous accused people have been lynched by outraged crowds.

A former provincial governor and a minister for minorities have also been shot dead because of blasphemy accusations.

Rights groups say accusations of blasphemy are also misused to settle scores. Hundreds of people are languishing in prison after being accused as judges often put off trials, fearing retribution if they are seen as being too lenient, they say.

""The frequency and scale of such attacks — which are systematic, violent and often uncontainable — appear to have increased in the last several years,"" said the Human Rights Commision of Pakistan.

The rights group called for the setting up and equipping of special police forces to protect religious minorities’ sites of worship as directed by the 2014 Supreme Court judgment.

Caretaker Prime Minister Anwar ul Haq Kakar called for stern action against those responsible for Wednesday's violence. ""I am gutted by the visuals coming out,"" he said.

Hundreds of people blocked a nearby highway to protest against the alleged desecration of the Koran.

A Christian leader, Akmal Bhatti, said the crowd had ""torched"" at least five churches and looted valuables from houses that had been abandoned by their owners.

Several social media posts showed some churches, houses and belongings on fire as police stood by.

The mob was made up of thousands of people led by local clerics, mainly from an Islamist political party called Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), a government source said.

The TLP, however, denied inciting the violence and said it had worked with police to try to calm things down.

Lithuania closes two Belarus border crossings,"VILNIUS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Lithuanian government said on Wednesday it had decided to close two of the country's six border crossing points with Belarus due to ""geopolitical circumstances"", weeks after Russian Wagner Group mercenaries took refuge in the country.

The government did not spell out the circumstances nor threats in its reasoning for closing from Friday the two rural crossing points, which were not used by commercial vehicles.

Over the previous few weeks Lithuanian officials have discouraged its citizens from travelling to Belarus, a close Russian ally, setting up signs at the borders saying: ""Do not risk your safety – do not travel to Belarus. You may fail to come back"".

Neighbouring Poland has closed all but one border crossing point with Belarus this year following the imprisonment of a journalist of Polish origin and expulsions of Polish diplomats.

Latvia, the third EU country bordering Belarus, has two operational crossings.

Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the border on Tuesday, after nearly 100 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross from Belarus in 24 hours.

Poland announced plans last week to move 10,000 additional troops to the Belarus border to support existing guards.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, began crossing from Belarus. They eventually resorted to pushing them back, a policy that is still in place.

The migrants keep appearing at the borders, in significantly smaller numbers.

Travis King case highlights North Korea's history of citing US racism,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea's claim on Wednesday that U.S. soldier Travis King fled racism and abuse in America comes as Pyongyang pushes back on Washington's criticism of the North's human rights record.

North Korea broke nearly a month of silence on King, who is Black, issuing a state media report that he had confessed to illegally and deliberately entering the North, driven by ""ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and disillusionment with inequality in U.S. society.

King has not been directly heard from, but an uncle in United States told media this month his nephew said he experienced racism during his military service.

The state media report comes a day before the United Nations Security Council is due to meet at the behest of Washington to discuss human rights abuses in North Korea.

For decades Pyongyang has highlighted racial discrimination in the United States as what it says is an example of Washington's hypocrisy, and analysts said North Korea is likely to use King's case to resist pressure over human rights.

""North Korea will likely highlight racism in the United States and use it as a means to counter the United States' criticism of North Korea's human rights situation, rather than engaging in negotiations with the U.S.,"" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at South Korea's Kyungnam University.

North Korea highlights racism in the United States to cast a negative light on it, and to make the point that the United States, which regularly points to human rights conditions in other countries, is in no position to do so, said Rachel Minyoung Lee of the U.S.-based Stimson Center.

North Korea's foreign ministry cited racial discrimination, among other ills, in a statement on Tuesday calling it a ""mockery of human rights and deception on the international community"" for the United States to call Thursday's meeting on human rights.

""Not content with conniving at and fostering racial discrimination, gun-related crimes, child maltreatment and forced labour rampant in its society, the U.S. has imposed unethical human rights standards on other countries and fomented internal unrest and confusion,"" the statement said.

In 2018, Pyongyang released a ""White Paper on Human Rights Violations in the U.S."", which accused the administration of Donald Trump of aggravating the ""racial discrimination and misanthropy"" already ""inherent to the social system of the U.S."", citing white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

During the protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, North Korean officials cited ""extreme racists"" in America and criticised authorities' response for threatening to ""unleash even dogs for suppression"".

In a report at the time, C. Harrison Kim, a professor at the University of Hawaii, told NK News, a Seoul-based site that monitors North Korea, that although the relationship had waned, Pyongyang's ""alliance with the Black Power movement was a very real thing"".

In 1969 Pyongyang hosted American author and activist Eldridge Cleaver, head of international affairs at the Black Panther Party (BPP), who wrote that North Korea and its ""great leader"" had ""heightened our consciousness to a level that makes us equal to the task of dealing with our number one enemy, the U.S. imperialist aggressors”.

North Korean state media has its own history of issuing racially charged statements.

In 2014, the state news agency published a report saying then-U.S. President Barack Obama ""looks like an African native monkey with a black face"", among other quotes comparing him to an animal.

A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim Jong Un himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.

That report included allegations that North Korea conducts forced abortions on women suspected to have been impregnated by men in China, driven by an underlying belief in a “pure Korean race” in North Korea to which mixed-race children are considered a contamination of its “pureness”.

German cabinet OKs landmark bill over legal cannabis use,"A person dressed in a costume depicting a cannabis leaf walks among marijuana activists to mark the annual world cannabis day and to protest for legalization of marijuana, in front of the Brandenburg Gate, in Berlin, Germany, April 20, 2022. REUTERS/Lisi Niesner/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Germany's cabinet passed a contentious bill on Wednesday to legalize recreational marijuana use and cultivation, one of the most liberal cannabis laws in Europe that could potentially provide further momentum for a similar worldwide trend.

The legislation, which still has to pass parliament, would allow adults to possess up to 25 grams (0.88 oz) of the drug, grow a maximum of three plants, or acquire weed as associates of non-profit cannabis clubs.

The centre-left government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz hopes the law will curb the black market, protect consumers against contaminated marijuana and reduce drug-related crime.

A key pillar of the plan, which removes the taboo around cannabis use, is also a campaign to raise awareness about the risks, which should ultimately curb consumption, said Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD).

Such a campaign would not gain the same level of attention if it were introduced without a change in the law, he said.

""With the current procedures we could not seriously protect children and young people, the topic has been made a taboo,"" Lauterbach told a news conference in Berlin to present the law.

""We have rising, problematic consumption, we couldn't simply allow this to go on,"" he said. ""So this is an important turning point in our drug policy.""

The number of adults in Germany aged between 18 and 25 years old that consumed cannabis at least once nearly doubled in 2021 from the previous decade to 25%, according to the health ministry.

Young adults are considered more vulnerable to the health risks of cannabis. The new legislation will limit the amount of cannabis young adults can buy to 30 grams a month, compared to 50 grams for older adults.

CRITICISM FROM BOTH SIDES

Opposition to the legislation is fierce, with conservative policymakers in particular warning that it will encourage marijuana use and that the new legislation will create even more work for authorities.

""This law will be linked to a complete loss of control,"" Armin Schuster, conservative interior minister for the state of Saxony, told media group RND.

A U.N. narcotics watchdog said in March moves by governments to legalize the recreational use of marijuana have led to increased consumption and cannabis-related health problems.

Lauterbach said Germany had learned from other countries' mistakes, however.

Scholz's government had already watered down original plans to allow the widespread sale of cannabis in licensed shops after consultations with Brussels.

Instead, it said would launch a pilot project for a small number of licensed shops in some regions to test the effects of a commercial supply chain of recreational cannabis over five years. For that, it will need to present separate legislation in a second phase.

Similar such projects already exist or are planned in the Netherlands and Switzerland.

Many countries in Europe have already legalised cannabis for limited medicinal purposes, including Germany since 2017. Others have decriminalized its general use.

Malta became the first European country to allow limited cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal use in late 2021. Germany would become the first major European country to do so.

The legislation presented on Wednesday includes strict rules for growing weed - cannabis clubs of up to 500 associates must have burglar-proof doors and windows, with greenhouses fenced off. Associates will not be allowed to smoke weed at the clubs or in the vicinity of schools, nurseries, playgrounds or sports grounds.

Germany's hemp association said the rules were ""unrealistic"" and the black market could only truly be fought with the introduction of cannabis sales in shops.

The parliamentary drug policy spokesperson of junior coalition partner the Free Democrats, Kristine Luetke, accused Lauterbach of continuing a ""prohibition policy"" and creating a ""bureaucratic monster"".

Factbox: Travis King: What happened to other U.S. soldiers who defected to North Korea?,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea on Wednesday confirmed it is holding U.S. Army Private Travis King after he crossed the border from South Korea last month while on a tour, but did not elaborate on what his future might hold.

State news agency KCNA said during an initial investigation that King confessed to illegally and deliberately crossing the border to escape mistreatment and racism in the army, and wants to stay in North Korea or another country.

Attempts by U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea to desert or defect to the authoritarian North are rare, but here are some cases that have occurred since the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty:

- Joseph T. White shot off the lock on a gate leading into the demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the Koreas while a U.S. soldier stationed in South Korea in 1982, before surrendering to North Korean troops, according to an account published by the Korea Times.

The North claimed he had defected, though Pyongyang refused a request by the United Nations Command to meet him. A U.S. military spokesman later said an investigation indicated that White crossed into North Korea of his own free will. In a video released by the North, White denounced the United States and praised North Korea and its then leader Kim Il-Sung.

White's parents later received a handwritten letter believed to be from their son, in which he said he was working as a teacher and happy in the North, the Washington Post reported. White drowned in a swimming accident in the North in 1985, according to a media report, citing information received by his parents.

- Charles Robert Jenkins walked into North Korea when on patrol on the DMZ in 1965. He later expressed regret for fleeing and explained at his court marital that his motive was to avoid hazardous duty in South Korea and combat in Vietnam. Jenkins said he had drunk 10 beers before the incident.

During his near four decades in the North, he taught English and also portrayed a U.S. spy in a propaganda film. Jenkins married Hitomi Soga, a Japanese woman abducted by Pyongyang. Soga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002 and Jenkins joined her with their two daughters in 2004. Jenkins died in 2017.

- James Joseph Dresnok was a 21-year old U.S. army private stationed in South Korea in 1962 when he fled to the North. Facing a court martial for skipping duty, Dresnok describes in a film about his life how he bolted across the DMZ, through a minefield.

Dresnok and three fellow American military defectors including Jenkins, Jerry Wayne Parrish and Larry Allen Abshier lived in relative isolation for years before becoming stars of North Korean cinema by depicting evil Americans in propaganda movies promoted by then leader Kim Jong-Il. Reports, citing Dresnok's sons, say he died in Pyongyang in 2016.

MOSCOW, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russia's lunar spacecraft entered the moon's orbit on Wednesday, a major step towards the country's ambition of being the first to land on the moon's south pole in the search for frozen water.

The Luna-25 entered the moon's orbit at 11:57 a.m. (0857 GMT), Russia's space corporate Roskosmos said.

Luna-25 will circle the moon, the earth's only natural satellite, for around 5 days, then change course for a soft landing on the lunar south pole planned for Aug. 21.

India's Chandrayaan-3 entered the moon's orbit earlier this month ahead of a planned touchdown on the south pole of the moon later this month.

The Luna-25, which is roughly the size of a small car, will aim to operate for a year on the south pole, where scientists at NASA and other space agencies in recent years have detected traces of frozen water in the craters.

The presence of water on the moon has implications for major space powers, potentially allowing longer human sojourns on the planet that would enable the mining of lunar resources.

No Russian spacecraft has entered lunar orbit since Luna-24, the Soviet Union's 1976 moon mission, according to Anatoly Zak, the creator and publisher of www.RussianSpaceWeb.com which tracks Russian space programmes.

""Entering lunar orbit is absolutely critical for the success of this project,"" Zak told Reuters. ""This is a first for the post-Soviet period.""

""Some are calling this the second lunar race so it is very important for Russia to resume this programme. Luna-25 is not just one mission - it is part of a much broader Russian strategy that stretches 10 years into the future.""

Travis King: who is the US soldier who crossed into North Korea?,"U.S. Private Travis T. King (wearing a black shirt and black cap) is seen in this picture taken during a tour of the tightly controlled Joint Security Area (JSA) on the border between the two Koreas, at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea, July 18, 2023. Sarah Leslie/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that it is holding American soldier Travis King, saying he crossed the border last month to escape racism and mistreatment in the U.S. military and society.

WHO IS PRIVATE KING?

Private Travis T. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, is a cavalry scout with the Korean Rotational Force, which is part of the U.S. security commitment to South Korea.

He was assigned to an element of the U.S. 1st Armored Division and was now administratively attached to a unit in 4th Infantry Division, a U.S. army spokesperson said.

His record includes routine awards such as the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal and Overseas Service Ribbon.

His family is from Racine, Wisconsin.

WHY DID HE CROSS TO NORTH KOREA AND WHERE IS HE NOW?

King's motivation and exact location remain unconfirmed.

He ""harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and wanted to stay in the North or a third country because he was ""disillusioned at the unequal American society,"" according to North Korean state news agency KCNA.

KCNA said he was held by the North Korean army after he crossed, but did not elaborate.

The Pentagon on Tuesday said that it could not verify King's alleged comments, but that it was working through all channels to bring him home.

King's uncle, Myron Gates, told ABC News in August that his nephew, who is Black, had experienced racism during his military deployment, and after he spent time in a South Korean jail, he did not sound like himself.

Another uncle, Carl Gates, told the Daily Beast his nephew had been ""breaking down"" after the death of a 7-year-old cousin this year.

HOW DID HE GET TO THE BORDER?

King had served nearly two months in detention in South Korea and was being escorted to Seoul's Incheon International Airport to fly home and face probable disciplinary action. But he never made it to his plane.

He had passed alone through security to his gate at the airport, where he told American Airlines staff that he lost his passport, an airport official told Reuters.

Escorted by an airline worker with the approval of a South Korean justice ministry official, King left the boarding zone and was seen exiting through a departure gate.

The next day King joined a bus tour of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice.

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BORDER?

Roughly 24 hours after leaving the airport, he sprinted into North Korea while touring the Joint Security Area, which sits astride the border.

Sarah Leslie, a tourist from New Zealand who was on the tour with King, said she saw him suddenly run across the border as U.S. and South Korean troops tried to stop him.

""I probably only saw him running for like a few seconds and that's all it would have taken to get across the border,"" she said.

WHAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS HE FACING?

Two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been due to face U.S. military disciplinary action, without saying what the action was linked to.

A South Korean court ruling said King pleaded guilty to assault and destruction of public goods stemming from an incident in October and on Feb. 8 the Seoul Western District Court fined him 5 million won ($4,000).

He faced two allegations of assault, and pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents.

King spent time in a South Korean prison, however, in lieu of paying the fine.

"Pakistan crowd vandalises churches, torches homes after two accused of blasphemy","LAHORE, Pakistan, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan on Wednesday, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran, police and community leaders said.

U.S. band the Killers apologises for bringing Russian fan on stage in Georgia,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - An American alternative-rock band, the Killers, has apologised for bringing a Russian drummer on stage during a show in Georgia and for describing fans as ""brothers and sisters,"" which prompted boos from the audience.

Georgia has a long history of tension with its northern neighbour, exacerbated by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and a subsequent big influx of Russian emigrants escaping their country.

The band, seven times nominated for the music industry's Grammy Awards, performed on Tuesday in the Black Sea resort of Batumi during a European tour.

""Good people of Georgia, it was never our intention to offend anyone!"" the band said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding that it had a longstanding tradition of inviting people to play the drums.

""We recognise that a comment, meant to suggest that all of the Killers' audience and fans are 'brothers and sisters,' could be misconstrued,"" it added.

White's parents later received a handwritten letter believed to be from their son, in which he said he was working as a teacher and happy in the North, the Washington Post reported. White drowned in a swimming accident in the North in 1985, according to a media report, citing information received by his parents.

- Charles Robert Jenkins walked into North Korea when on patrol on the DMZ in 1965. He later expressed regret for fleeing and explained at his court marital that his motive was to avoid hazardous duty in South Korea and combat in Vietnam. Jenkins said he had drunk 10 beers before the incident.

During his near four decades in the North, he taught English and also portrayed a U.S. spy in a propaganda film. Jenkins married Hitomi Soga, a Japanese woman abducted by Pyongyang. Soga was allowed to return to Japan in 2002 and Jenkins joined her with their two daughters in 2004. Jenkins died in 2017.

- James Joseph Dresnok was a 21-year old U.S. army private stationed in South Korea in 1962 when he fled to the North. Facing a court martial for skipping duty, Dresnok describes in a film about his life how he bolted across the DMZ, through a minefield.

Dresnok and three fellow American military defectors including Jenkins, Jerry Wayne Parrish and Larry Allen Abshier lived in relative isolation for years before becoming stars of North Korean cinema by depicting evil Americans in propaganda movies promoted by then leader Kim Jong-Il. Reports, citing Dresnok's sons, say he died in Pyongyang in 2016.

MOSCOW, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russia's lunar spacecraft entered the moon's orbit on Wednesday, a major step towards the country's ambition of being the first to land on the moon's south pole in the search for frozen water.

The Luna-25 entered the moon's orbit at 11:57 a.m. (0857 GMT), Russia's space corporate Roskosmos said.

Luna-25 will circle the moon, the earth's only natural satellite, for around 5 days, then change course for a soft landing on the lunar south pole planned for Aug. 21.

India's Chandrayaan-3 entered the moon's orbit earlier this month ahead of a planned touchdown on the south pole of the moon later this month.

The Luna-25, which is roughly the size of a small car, will aim to operate for a year on the south pole, where scientists at NASA and other space agencies in recent years have detected traces of frozen water in the craters.

The presence of water on the moon has implications for major space powers, potentially allowing longer human sojourns on the planet that would enable the mining of lunar resources.

No Russian spacecraft has entered lunar orbit since Luna-24, the Soviet Union's 1976 moon mission, according to Anatoly Zak, the creator and publisher of www.RussianSpaceWeb.com which tracks Russian space programmes.

""Entering lunar orbit is absolutely critical for the success of this project,"" Zak told Reuters. ""This is a first for the post-Soviet period.""

""Some are calling this the second lunar race so it is very important for Russia to resume this programme. Luna-25 is not just one mission - it is part of a much broader Russian strategy that stretches 10 years into the future.""

Travis King: who is the US soldier who crossed into North Korea?,"U.S. Private Travis T. King (wearing a black shirt and black cap) is seen in this picture taken during a tour of the tightly controlled Joint Security Area (JSA) on the border between the two Koreas, at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea, July 18, 2023. Sarah Leslie/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that it is holding American soldier Travis King, saying he crossed the border last month to escape racism and mistreatment in the U.S. military and society.

WHO IS PRIVATE KING?

Private Travis T. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, is a cavalry scout with the Korean Rotational Force, which is part of the U.S. security commitment to South Korea.

He was assigned to an element of the U.S. 1st Armored Division and was now administratively attached to a unit in 4th Infantry Division, a U.S. army spokesperson said.

His record includes routine awards such as the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal and Overseas Service Ribbon.

His family is from Racine, Wisconsin.

WHY DID HE CROSS TO NORTH KOREA AND WHERE IS HE NOW?

King's motivation and exact location remain unconfirmed.

He ""harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and wanted to stay in the North or a third country because he was ""disillusioned at the unequal American society,"" according to North Korean state news agency KCNA.

KCNA said he was held by the North Korean army after he crossed, but did not elaborate.

The Pentagon on Tuesday said that it could not verify King's alleged comments, but that it was working through all channels to bring him home.

King's uncle, Myron Gates, told ABC News in August that his nephew, who is Black, had experienced racism during his military deployment, and after he spent time in a South Korean jail, he did not sound like himself.

Another uncle, Carl Gates, told the Daily Beast his nephew had been ""breaking down"" after the death of a 7-year-old cousin this year.

HOW DID HE GET TO THE BORDER?

King had served nearly two months in detention in South Korea and was being escorted to Seoul's Incheon International Airport to fly home and face probable disciplinary action. But he never made it to his plane.

He had passed alone through security to his gate at the airport, where he told American Airlines staff that he lost his passport, an airport official told Reuters.

Escorted by an airline worker with the approval of a South Korean justice ministry official, King left the boarding zone and was seen exiting through a departure gate.

The next day King joined a bus tour of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice.

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BORDER?

Roughly 24 hours after leaving the airport, he sprinted into North Korea while touring the Joint Security Area, which sits astride the border.

Sarah Leslie, a tourist from New Zealand who was on the tour with King, said she saw him suddenly run across the border as U.S. and South Korean troops tried to stop him.

""I probably only saw him running for like a few seconds and that's all it would have taken to get across the border,"" she said.

WHAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS HE FACING?

Two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been due to face U.S. military disciplinary action, without saying what the action was linked to.

A South Korean court ruling said King pleaded guilty to assault and destruction of public goods stemming from an incident in October and on Feb. 8 the Seoul Western District Court fined him 5 million won ($4,000).

He faced two allegations of assault, and pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents.

King spent time in a South Korean prison, however, in lieu of paying the fine.

SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Singapore police have arrested 10 foreigners for alleged money laundering and forgery offences, in a case involving about S$1 billion ($737 million) of cash, properties, luxury cars and other assets.

The police conducted simultaneous raids on Tuesday across the city-state to arrest the suspects, their statement said on Wednesday.

Prohibition of disposal orders were issued against 94 properties and 50 vehicles, with a total estimated value of more than S$815 million.

Other seizures included bank accounts, cash, luxury bags, jewellery, watches, electronic devices and some documents with information on virtual assets.

The foreigners were aged between 31 and 44, and their nationalities include Chinese, Turkish, Cypriot, Cambodian and Ni-Vanuatu, Singapore police said.

In a separate statement, the Singapore central bank said it has been ""in touch with the financial institutions (FIs) where the potentially tainted funds have been identified. Supervisory engagements with these FIs are ongoing"", without naming the FIs.

"Pakistan crowd vandalises churches, torches homes after two accused of blasphemy","LAHORE, Pakistan, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan on Wednesday, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran, police and community leaders said.

The attack took place in Jaranwala in the industrial district of Faisalabad, police spokesman Naveed Ahmad said. The two Christians were accused of blasphemy, he said, adding they and family members had fled their homes.

Resident Shakil Masih said he heard announcements inciting the mob and then saw crowds heading towards his Christian area.

""I left my home immediately with my family. Several other families did the same,"" he told Reuters.

The area has been cordoned off as police negotiated with the crowd, provincial police chief Usman Anwar told English Dawn.com online publication.

The police case against the two Christians is that they found pages of the Koran with some derogatory remarks written in red.

Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan and though no one has ever been executed for it, numerous accused people have been lynched by outraged crowds.

A former provincial governor and a minister for minorities have also been shot dead because of blasphemy accusations.

[1/5]People stand near objects set on fire on a street, in Jaranwala, Pakistan August 16, 2023 in this screengrab obtained from a video by REUTERS TV via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights

Rights groups say accusations of blasphemy are also misused to settle scores. Hundreds of people are languishing in prison after being accused as judges often put off trials, fearing retribution if they are seen as being too lenient, they say.

""The frequency and scale of such attacks — which are systematic, violent and often uncontainable — appear to have increased in the last several years,"" said the Human Rights Commision of Pakistan.

The rights group called for the setting up and equipping of special police forces to protect religious minorities’ sites of worship as directed by the 2014 Supreme Court judgment.

Caretaker Prime Minister Anwar ul Haq Kakar called for stern action against those responsible for Wednesday's violence. ""I am gutted by the visuals coming out,"" he said.

Hundreds of people blocked a nearby highway to protest against the alleged desecration of the Koran.

A Christian leader, Akmal Bhatti, said the crowd had ""torched"" at least five churches and looted valuables from houses that had been abandoned by their owners.

Several social media posts showed some churches, houses and belongings on fire as police stood by.

The mob was made up of thousands of people led by local clerics, mainly from an Islamist political party called Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), a government source said.

The TLP, however, denied inciting the violence and said it had worked with police to try to calm things down.

Lithuania closes two Belarus border crossings,"VILNIUS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Lithuanian government said on Wednesday it had decided to close two of the country's six border crossing points with Belarus due to ""geopolitical circumstances"", weeks after Russian Wagner Group mercenaries took refuge in the country.

The government did not spell out the circumstances nor threats in its reasoning for closing from Friday the two rural crossing points, which were not used by commercial vehicles.

Over the previous few weeks Lithuanian officials have discouraged its citizens from travelling to Belarus, a close Russian ally, setting up signs at the borders saying: ""Do not risk your safety – do not travel to Belarus. You may fail to come back"".

Neighbouring Poland has closed all but one border crossing point with Belarus this year following the imprisonment of a journalist of Polish origin and expulsions of Polish diplomats.

Latvia, the third EU country bordering Belarus, has two operational crossings.

Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the border on Tuesday, after nearly 100 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross from Belarus in 24 hours.

Poland announced plans last week to move 10,000 additional troops to the Belarus border to support existing guards.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, began crossing from Belarus. They eventually resorted to pushing them back, a policy that is still in place.

The migrants keep appearing at the borders, in significantly smaller numbers.

Travis King case highlights North Korea's history of citing US racism,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea's claim on Wednesday that U.S. soldier Travis King fled racism and abuse in America comes as Pyongyang pushes back on Washington's criticism of the North's human rights record.

North Korea broke nearly a month of silence on King, who is Black, issuing a state media report that he had confessed to illegally and deliberately entering the North, driven by ""ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and disillusionment with inequality in U.S. society.

King has not been directly heard from, but an uncle in United States told media this month his nephew said he experienced racism during his military service.

The state media report comes a day before the United Nations Security Council is due to meet at the behest of Washington to discuss human rights abuses in North Korea.

For decades Pyongyang has highlighted racial discrimination in the United States as what it says is an example of Washington's hypocrisy, and analysts said North Korea is likely to use King's case to resist pressure over human rights.

""North Korea will likely highlight racism in the United States and use it as a means to counter the United States' criticism of North Korea's human rights situation, rather than engaging in negotiations with the U.S.,"" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at South Korea's Kyungnam University.

North Korea highlights racism in the United States to cast a negative light on it, and to make the point that the United States, which regularly points to human rights conditions in other countries, is in no position to do so, said Rachel Minyoung Lee of the U.S.-based Stimson Center.

North Korea's foreign ministry cited racial discrimination, among other ills, in a statement on Tuesday calling it a ""mockery of human rights and deception on the international community"" for the United States to call Thursday's meeting on human rights.

U.S. Army soldier Travis King appears in this unknown location, undated photo obtained by REUTERS /File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

""Not content with conniving at and fostering racial discrimination, gun-related crimes, child maltreatment and forced labour rampant in its society, the U.S. has imposed unethical human rights standards on other countries and fomented internal unrest and confusion,"" the statement said.

In 2018, Pyongyang released a ""White Paper on Human Rights Violations in the U.S."", which accused the administration of Donald Trump of aggravating the ""racial discrimination and misanthropy"" already ""inherent to the social system of the U.S."", citing white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

During the protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, North Korean officials cited ""extreme racists"" in America and criticised authorities' response for threatening to ""unleash even dogs for suppression"".

In a report at the time, C. Harrison Kim, a professor at the University of Hawaii, told NK News, a Seoul-based site that monitors North Korea, that although the relationship had waned, Pyongyang's ""alliance with the Black Power movement was a very real thing"".

In 1969 Pyongyang hosted American author and activist Eldridge Cleaver, head of international affairs at the Black Panther Party (BPP), who wrote that North Korea and its ""great leader"" had ""heightened our consciousness to a level that makes us equal to the task of dealing with our number one enemy, the U.S. imperialist aggressors”.

North Korean state media has its own history of issuing racially charged statements.

In 2014, the state news agency published a report saying then-U.S. President Barack Obama ""looks like an African native monkey with a black face"", among other quotes comparing him to an animal.

A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim Jong Un himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.

That report included allegations that North Korea conducts forced abortions on women suspected to have been impregnated by men in China, driven by an underlying belief in a “pure Korean race” in North Korea to which mixed-race children are considered a contamination of its “pureness”.

U.S. band the Killers apologises for bringing Russian fan on stage in Georgia,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - An American alternative-rock band, the Killers, has apologised for bringing a Russian drummer on stage during a show in Georgia and for describing fans as ""brothers and sisters,"" which prompted boos from the audience.

Georgia has a long history of tension with its northern neighbour, exacerbated by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and a subsequent big influx of Russian emigrants escaping their country.

The band, seven times nominated for the music industry's Grammy Awards, performed on Tuesday in the Black Sea resort of Batumi during a European tour.

""Good people of Georgia, it was never our intention to offend anyone!"" the band said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding that it had a longstanding tradition of inviting people to play the drums.

""We recognise that a comment, meant to suggest that all of the Killers' audience and fans are 'brothers and sisters,' could be misconstrued,"" it added.

The reference was to a remark band leader Brandon Flowers made to the crowd, saying he did not want the situation to turn ""angry"".

""I see you as my brothers and my sisters,"" Flowers added to the sound of boos and whistles in a video published by the Russian state RIA news agency.

Videos on social media showed people leaving the show, in addition to the booing.

Georgian public opinion is overwhelmingly pro-Ukrainian.

The band has sold millions of albums, with many songs topping the charts since it formed in the city of Las Vegas in the early 2000s.

Niger says 17 of its soldiers killed in ambush near Burkina Faso border,"NIAMEY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Wednesday said 17 of its soldiers were killed in an ambush by insurgents, the deadliest attack since a July 26 coup whose leaders have cited persistent insecurity as a justification for deposing the civilian government.

The ambush took place on Tuesday about 60 km (40 miles) from the capital Niamey, in a southwestern area that borders Burkina Faso, the defence ministry said, adding that 100 attackers it referred to as ""terrorists"" were killed.

""The swift reaction of the soldiers and the air-land response at the scene of the skirmish enabled the enemy to be dealt with,"" the ministry said.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the main regional bloc, said it had learned with sadness of various attacks by armed groups that had led to the death of ""several"" soldiers. It called on Niger's military leaders to restore constitutional order so they could focus on security, which it said had become increasingly fragile since the coup.

Niger, like other countries in West Africa's Sahel region, has been struggling for years to contain an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes and caused food shortages.

The perceived inability of civilian governments to overcome the problem has been one of the factors in a string of coups in the region, although in the case of Niger the main drivers of the army takeover were internal politics.

Members of the presidential guard, headed by General Abdourahmane Tiani, deposed President Mohamed Bazoum and are still detaining him, defying pressure from the United Nations, ECOWAS and Western powers to reinstate him.

While Tiani said the takeover was necessary to quell the insurgency, analysts say attacks, though still frequent, had been falling under Bazoum, who had tried to engage with Islamists and rural communities where they are rooted.

Niger hosts U.S., French, German and Italian troops as part of international efforts to combat the insurgency, under agreements with the now deposed civilian government.

The future of those foreign contingents is unclear, with the junta using vitriolic anti-French rhetoric and resisting pressure from ECOWAS, the U.N. and Western countries to negotiate a way out of the current situation.

Niger has extra strategic importance to global powers due to its uranium and oil deposits.

Insecurity remains a major problem across the southwest, near the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, both of which also have army governments that took control through coups.

On the Malian side, the departure of French troops last year left a security vacuum that the Islamists have exploited.

Mali's junta brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses. Wagner says it works lawfully.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that it is holding American soldier Travis King, saying he crossed the border last month to escape racism and mistreatment in the U.S. military and society.

Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the border on Tuesday, after nearly 100 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross from Belarus in 24 hours.

Poland announced plans last week to move 10,000 additional troops to the Belarus border to support existing guards.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, began crossing from Belarus. They eventually resorted to pushing them back, a policy that is still in place.

The migrants keep appearing at the borders, in significantly smaller numbers.

Travis King case highlights North Korea's history of citing US racism,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea's claim on Wednesday that U.S. soldier Travis King fled racism and abuse in America comes as Pyongyang pushes back on Washington's criticism of the North's human rights record.

North Korea broke nearly a month of silence on King, who is Black, issuing a state media report that he had confessed to illegally and deliberately entering the North, driven by ""ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and disillusionment with inequality in U.S. society.

King has not been directly heard from, but an uncle in United States told media this month his nephew said he experienced racism during his military service.

The state media report comes a day before the United Nations Security Council is due to meet at the behest of Washington to discuss human rights abuses in North Korea.

For decades Pyongyang has highlighted racial discrimination in the United States as what it says is an example of Washington's hypocrisy, and analysts said North Korea is likely to use King's case to resist pressure over human rights.

""North Korea will likely highlight racism in the United States and use it as a means to counter the United States' criticism of North Korea's human rights situation, rather than engaging in negotiations with the U.S.,"" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at South Korea's Kyungnam University.

North Korea highlights racism in the United States to cast a negative light on it, and to make the point that the United States, which regularly points to human rights conditions in other countries, is in no position to do so, said Rachel Minyoung Lee of the U.S.-based Stimson Center.

North Korea's foreign ministry cited racial discrimination, among other ills, in a statement on Tuesday calling it a ""mockery of human rights and deception on the international community"" for the United States to call Thursday's meeting on human rights.

""Not content with conniving at and fostering racial discrimination, gun-related crimes, child maltreatment and forced labour rampant in its society, the U.S. has imposed unethical human rights standards on other countries and fomented internal unrest and confusion,"" the statement said.

In 2018, Pyongyang released a ""White Paper on Human Rights Violations in the U.S."", which accused the administration of Donald Trump of aggravating the ""racial discrimination and misanthropy"" already ""inherent to the social system of the U.S."", citing white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

During the protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, North Korean officials cited ""extreme racists"" in America and criticised authorities' response for threatening to ""unleash even dogs for suppression"".

In a report at the time, C. Harrison Kim, a professor at the University of Hawaii, told NK News, a Seoul-based site that monitors North Korea, that although the relationship had waned, Pyongyang's ""alliance with the Black Power movement was a very real thing"".

In 1969 Pyongyang hosted American author and activist Eldridge Cleaver, head of international affairs at the Black Panther Party (BPP), who wrote that North Korea and its ""great leader"" had ""heightened our consciousness to a level that makes us equal to the task of dealing with our number one enemy, the U.S. imperialist aggressors”.

North Korean state media has its own history of issuing racially charged statements.

In 2014, the state news agency published a report saying then-U.S. President Barack Obama ""looks like an African native monkey with a black face"", among other quotes comparing him to an animal.

A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim Jong Un himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.

That report included allegations that North Korea conducts forced abortions on women suspected to have been impregnated by men in China, driven by an underlying belief in a “pure Korean race” in North Korea to which mixed-race children are considered a contamination of its “pureness”.

U.S. band the Killers apologises for bringing Russian fan on stage in Georgia,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - An American alternative-rock band, the Killers, has apologised for bringing a Russian drummer on stage during a show in Georgia and for describing fans as ""brothers and sisters,"" which prompted boos from the audience.

Georgia has a long history of tension with its northern neighbour, exacerbated by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and a subsequent big influx of Russian emigrants escaping their country.

The band, seven times nominated for the music industry's Grammy Awards, performed on Tuesday in the Black Sea resort of Batumi during a European tour.

""Good people of Georgia, it was never our intention to offend anyone!"" the band said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding that it had a longstanding tradition of inviting people to play the drums.

""We recognise that a comment, meant to suggest that all of the Killers' audience and fans are 'brothers and sisters,' could be misconstrued,"" it added.

The reference was to a remark band leader Brandon Flowers made to the crowd, saying he did not want the situation to turn ""angry"".

""I see you as my brothers and my sisters,"" Flowers added to the sound of boos and whistles in a video published by the Russian state RIA news agency.

Videos on social media showed people leaving the show, in addition to the booing.

Georgian public opinion is overwhelmingly pro-Ukrainian.

The band has sold millions of albums, with many songs topping the charts since it formed in the city of Las Vegas in the early 2000s.

Niger says 17 of its soldiers killed in ambush near Burkina Faso border,"NIAMEY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Wednesday said 17 of its soldiers were killed in an ambush by insurgents, the deadliest attack since a July 26 coup whose leaders have cited persistent insecurity as a justification for deposing the civilian government.

The ambush took place on Tuesday about 60 km (40 miles) from the capital Niamey, in a southwestern area that borders Burkina Faso, the defence ministry said, adding that 100 attackers it referred to as ""terrorists"" were killed.

""The swift reaction of the soldiers and the air-land response at the scene of the skirmish enabled the enemy to be dealt with,"" the ministry said.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the main regional bloc, said it had learned with sadness of various attacks by armed groups that had led to the death of ""several"" soldiers. It called on Niger's military leaders to restore constitutional order so they could focus on security, which it said had become increasingly fragile since the coup.

Niger, like other countries in West Africa's Sahel region, has been struggling for years to contain an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes and caused food shortages.

The perceived inability of civilian governments to overcome the problem has been one of the factors in a string of coups in the region, although in the case of Niger the main drivers of the army takeover were internal politics.

Members of the presidential guard, headed by General Abdourahmane Tiani, deposed President Mohamed Bazoum and are still detaining him, defying pressure from the United Nations, ECOWAS and Western powers to reinstate him.

While Tiani said the takeover was necessary to quell the insurgency, analysts say attacks, though still frequent, had been falling under Bazoum, who had tried to engage with Islamists and rural communities where they are rooted.

Niger hosts U.S., French, German and Italian troops as part of international efforts to combat the insurgency, under agreements with the now deposed civilian government.

The future of those foreign contingents is unclear, with the junta using vitriolic anti-French rhetoric and resisting pressure from ECOWAS, the U.N. and Western countries to negotiate a way out of the current situation.

Niger has extra strategic importance to global powers due to its uranium and oil deposits.

Insecurity remains a major problem across the southwest, near the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, both of which also have army governments that took control through coups.

On the Malian side, the departure of French troops last year left a security vacuum that the Islamists have exploited.

Mali's junta brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses. Wagner says it works lawfully.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

Germany walks back plan to meet NATO spending target on annual basis,"Banners displaying the NATO logo are placed at the entrance of new NATO headquarters during the move to the new building, in Brussels, Belgium April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The German government has retreated from a plan to legally commit itself to meeting NATO's 2% military spending target on an annual basis, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday.

A corresponding clause in a draft of the budget financing law passed by the cabinet of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday was deleted at short notice, the source said.

The change means that Germany will be able to stick to its current pledge of meeting the 2% target on average over a five-year period.

This wording is softer than Scholz's original pledge in a speech on Feb 27, 2022, in which he announced a ""Zeitenwende"" or sea change three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""From now on, we will invest more than 2% of the GDP into our defence year after year,"" Scholz said at the time.

A German government spokesperson declined to comment on the particulars of the draft law.

NATO allies have criticised Berlin strongly in the past for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence annually.

It is unclear whether Berlin will keep military spending over this threshold once a 100 billion euro ($101 billion) special fund to bring the Bundeswehr back up to standard is used up.

Travis King: who is the US soldier who crossed into North Korea?,"U.S. Private Travis T. King (wearing a black shirt and black cap) is seen in this picture taken during a tour of the tightly controlled Joint Security Area (JSA) on the border between the two Koreas, at the truce village of Panmunjom, South Korea, July 18, 2023. Sarah Leslie/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea confirmed for the first time on Wednesday that it is holding American soldier Travis King, saying he crossed the border last month to escape racism and mistreatment in the U.S. military and society.

WHO IS PRIVATE KING?

Private Travis T. King, who joined the U.S. Army in January 2021, is a cavalry scout with the Korean Rotational Force, which is part of the U.S. security commitment to South Korea.

He was assigned to an element of the U.S. 1st Armored Division and was now administratively attached to a unit in 4th Infantry Division, a U.S. army spokesperson said.

His record includes routine awards such as the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal and Overseas Service Ribbon.

His family is from Racine, Wisconsin.

WHY DID HE CROSS TO NORTH KOREA AND WHERE IS HE NOW?

King's motivation and exact location remain unconfirmed.

He ""harbored ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and wanted to stay in the North or a third country because he was ""disillusioned at the unequal American society,"" according to North Korean state news agency KCNA.

KCNA said he was held by the North Korean army after he crossed, but did not elaborate.

The Pentagon on Tuesday said that it could not verify King's alleged comments, but that it was working through all channels to bring him home.

King's uncle, Myron Gates, told ABC News in August that his nephew, who is Black, had experienced racism during his military deployment, and after he spent time in a South Korean jail, he did not sound like himself.

Another uncle, Carl Gates, told the Daily Beast his nephew had been ""breaking down"" after the death of a 7-year-old cousin this year.

HOW DID HE GET TO THE BORDER?

King had served nearly two months in detention in South Korea and was being escorted to Seoul's Incheon International Airport to fly home and face probable disciplinary action. But he never made it to his plane.

He had passed alone through security to his gate at the airport, where he told American Airlines staff that he lost his passport, an airport official told Reuters.

Escorted by an airline worker with the approval of a South Korean justice ministry official, King left the boarding zone and was seen exiting through a departure gate.

The next day King joined a bus tour of the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice.

WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BORDER?

Roughly 24 hours after leaving the airport, he sprinted into North Korea while touring the Joint Security Area, which sits astride the border.

Sarah Leslie, a tourist from New Zealand who was on the tour with King, said she saw him suddenly run across the border as U.S. and South Korean troops tried to stop him.

""I probably only saw him running for like a few seconds and that's all it would have taken to get across the border,"" she said.

WHAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION WAS HE FACING?

Two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been due to face U.S. military disciplinary action, without saying what the action was linked to.

A South Korean court ruling said King pleaded guilty to assault and destruction of public goods stemming from an incident in October and on Feb. 8 the Seoul Western District Court fined him 5 million won ($4,000).

He faced two allegations of assault, and pleaded guilty to one instance of assault and destroying public property for damaging a police car during a profanity-laced tirade against Koreans, according to court documents.

King spent time in a South Korean prison, however, in lieu of paying the fine.

SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Singapore police have arrested 10 foreigners for alleged money laundering and forgery offences, in a case involving about S$1 billion ($737 million) of cash, properties, luxury cars and other assets.

The police conducted simultaneous raids on Tuesday across the city-state to arrest the suspects, their statement said on Wednesday.

Prohibition of disposal orders were issued against 94 properties and 50 vehicles, with a total estimated value of more than S$815 million.

Other seizures included bank accounts, cash, luxury bags, jewellery, watches, electronic devices and some documents with information on virtual assets.

The foreigners were aged between 31 and 44, and their nationalities include Chinese, Turkish, Cypriot, Cambodian and Ni-Vanuatu, Singapore police said.

In a separate statement, the Singapore central bank said it has been ""in touch with the financial institutions (FIs) where the potentially tainted funds have been identified. Supervisory engagements with these FIs are ongoing"", without naming the FIs.

"Pakistan crowd vandalises churches, torches homes after two accused of blasphemy","LAHORE, Pakistan, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan on Wednesday, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran, police and community leaders said.

The attack took place in Jaranwala in the industrial district of Faisalabad, police spokesman Naveed Ahmad said. The two Christians were accused of blasphemy, he said, adding they and family members had fled their homes.

Resident Shakil Masih said he heard announcements inciting the mob and then saw crowds heading towards his Christian area.

""I left my home immediately with my family. Several other families did the same,"" he told Reuters.

The area has been cordoned off as police negotiated with the crowd, provincial police chief Usman Anwar told English Dawn.com online publication.

The police case against the two Christians is that they found pages of the Koran with some derogatory remarks written in red.

Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan and though no one has ever been executed for it, numerous accused people have been lynched by outraged crowds.

A former provincial governor and a minister for minorities have also been shot dead because of blasphemy accusations.

Rights groups say accusations of blasphemy are also misused to settle scores. Hundreds of people are languishing in prison after being accused as judges often put off trials, fearing retribution if they are seen as being too lenient, they say.

""The frequency and scale of such attacks — which are systematic, violent and often uncontainable — appear to have increased in the last several years,"" said the Human Rights Commision of Pakistan.

The rights group called for the setting up and equipping of special police forces to protect religious minorities’ sites of worship as directed by the 2014 Supreme Court judgment.

Caretaker Prime Minister Anwar ul Haq Kakar called for stern action against those responsible for Wednesday's violence. ""I am gutted by the visuals coming out,"" he said.

Hundreds of people blocked a nearby highway to protest against the alleged desecration of the Koran.

A Christian leader, Akmal Bhatti, said the crowd had ""torched"" at least five churches and looted valuables from houses that had been abandoned by their owners.

Several social media posts showed some churches, houses and belongings on fire as police stood by.

The mob was made up of thousands of people led by local clerics, mainly from an Islamist political party called Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), a government source said.

The TLP, however, denied inciting the violence and said it had worked with police to try to calm things down.

Lithuania closes two Belarus border crossings,"VILNIUS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Lithuanian government said on Wednesday it had decided to close two of the country's six border crossing points with Belarus due to ""geopolitical circumstances"", weeks after Russian Wagner Group mercenaries took refuge in the country.

The government did not spell out the circumstances nor threats in its reasoning for closing from Friday the two rural crossing points, which were not used by commercial vehicles.

Over the previous few weeks Lithuanian officials have discouraged its citizens from travelling to Belarus, a close Russian ally, setting up signs at the borders saying: ""Do not risk your safety – do not travel to Belarus. You may fail to come back"".

Neighbouring Poland has closed all but one border crossing point with Belarus this year following the imprisonment of a journalist of Polish origin and expulsions of Polish diplomats.

Latvia, the third EU country bordering Belarus, has two operational crossings.

Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the border on Tuesday, after nearly 100 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross from Belarus in 24 hours.

Poland announced plans last week to move 10,000 additional troops to the Belarus border to support existing guards.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, began crossing from Belarus. They eventually resorted to pushing them back, a policy that is still in place.

The migrants keep appearing at the borders, in significantly smaller numbers.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said he met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy a few weeks ago and agreed to a resolution that could extend current federal government spending for a few months.

""We agreed we should do a CR ... where you just extend the existing funding for a few months so we could work this out, and I thought that was a good sign,"" the chamber's top Democrat told MSNBC, referring to a temporary spending measure known as a continuing resolution.

Current government funding is due to expire Sept. 30 with the fiscal year beginning Oct 1, and no action to fund the federal government could trigger a shutdown.

Any spending measures would have to pass both the Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Schumer warned against McCarthy, a Republican, following hardline members of his party who may be pushing for a shutdown over Ukraine funding and other issues, and noted that there is bipartisan support in the Senate to pass regular appropriations bills to fund the U.S. government.

"Pakistan crowd vandalises churches, torches homes after two accused of blasphemy","LAHORE, Pakistan, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Muslim crowd attacked a Christian community in eastern Pakistan on Wednesday, vandalising several churches and setting scores of houses on fire after accusing two of its members of desecrating the Koran, police and community leaders said.

The attack took place in Jaranwala in the industrial district of Faisalabad, police spokesman Naveed Ahmad said. The two Christians were accused of blasphemy, he said, adding they and family members had fled their homes.

Resident Shakil Masih said he heard announcements inciting the mob and then saw crowds heading towards his Christian area.

""I left my home immediately with my family. Several other families did the same,"" he told Reuters.

The area has been cordoned off as police negotiated with the crowd, provincial police chief Usman Anwar told English Dawn.com online publication.

The police case against the two Christians is that they found pages of the Koran with some derogatory remarks written in red.

Blasphemy is punishable by death in Pakistan and though no one has ever been executed for it, numerous accused people have been lynched by outraged crowds.

A former provincial governor and a minister for minorities have also been shot dead because of blasphemy accusations.

Rights groups say accusations of blasphemy are also misused to settle scores. Hundreds of people are languishing in prison after being accused as judges often put off trials, fearing retribution if they are seen as being too lenient, they say.

""The frequency and scale of such attacks — which are systematic, violent and often uncontainable — appear to have increased in the last several years,"" said the Human Rights Commision of Pakistan.

The rights group called for the setting up and equipping of special police forces to protect religious minorities’ sites of worship as directed by the 2014 Supreme Court judgment.

Caretaker Prime Minister Anwar ul Haq Kakar called for stern action against those responsible for Wednesday's violence. ""I am gutted by the visuals coming out,"" he said.

Hundreds of people blocked a nearby highway to protest against the alleged desecration of the Koran.

A Christian leader, Akmal Bhatti, said the crowd had ""torched"" at least five churches and looted valuables from houses that had been abandoned by their owners.

Several social media posts showed some churches, houses and belongings on fire as police stood by.

The mob was made up of thousands of people led by local clerics, mainly from an Islamist political party called Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP), a government source said.

The TLP, however, denied inciting the violence and said it had worked with police to try to calm things down.

Lithuania closes two Belarus border crossings,"VILNIUS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Lithuanian government said on Wednesday it had decided to close two of the country's six border crossing points with Belarus due to ""geopolitical circumstances"", weeks after Russian Wagner Group mercenaries took refuge in the country.

The government did not spell out the circumstances nor threats in its reasoning for closing from Friday the two rural crossing points, which were not used by commercial vehicles.

Over the previous few weeks Lithuanian officials have discouraged its citizens from travelling to Belarus, a close Russian ally, setting up signs at the borders saying: ""Do not risk your safety – do not travel to Belarus. You may fail to come back"".

Neighbouring Poland has closed all but one border crossing point with Belarus this year following the imprisonment of a journalist of Polish origin and expulsions of Polish diplomats.

Latvia, the third EU country bordering Belarus, has two operational crossings.

Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the border on Tuesday, after nearly 100 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross from Belarus in 24 hours.

Poland announced plans last week to move 10,000 additional troops to the Belarus border to support existing guards.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, began crossing from Belarus. They eventually resorted to pushing them back, a policy that is still in place.

The migrants keep appearing at the borders, in significantly smaller numbers.

Travis King case highlights North Korea's history of citing US racism,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea's claim on Wednesday that U.S. soldier Travis King fled racism and abuse in America comes as Pyongyang pushes back on Washington's criticism of the North's human rights record.

North Korea broke nearly a month of silence on King, who is Black, issuing a state media report that he had confessed to illegally and deliberately entering the North, driven by ""ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and disillusionment with inequality in U.S. society.

King has not been directly heard from, but an uncle in United States told media this month his nephew said he experienced racism during his military service.

The state media report comes a day before the United Nations Security Council is due to meet at the behest of Washington to discuss human rights abuses in North Korea.

For decades Pyongyang has highlighted racial discrimination in the United States as what it says is an example of Washington's hypocrisy, and analysts said North Korea is likely to use King's case to resist pressure over human rights.

""North Korea will likely highlight racism in the United States and use it as a means to counter the United States' criticism of North Korea's human rights situation, rather than engaging in negotiations with the U.S.,"" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at South Korea's Kyungnam University.

North Korea highlights racism in the United States to cast a negative light on it, and to make the point that the United States, which regularly points to human rights conditions in other countries, is in no position to do so, said Rachel Minyoung Lee of the U.S.-based Stimson Center.

North Korea's foreign ministry cited racial discrimination, among other ills, in a statement on Tuesday calling it a ""mockery of human rights and deception on the international community"" for the United States to call Thursday's meeting on human rights.

""Not content with conniving at and fostering racial discrimination, gun-related crimes, child maltreatment and forced labour rampant in its society, the U.S. has imposed unethical human rights standards on other countries and fomented internal unrest and confusion,"" the statement said.

In 2018, Pyongyang released a ""White Paper on Human Rights Violations in the U.S."", which accused the administration of Donald Trump of aggravating the ""racial discrimination and misanthropy"" already ""inherent to the social system of the U.S."", citing white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

During the protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, North Korean officials cited ""extreme racists"" in America and criticised authorities' response for threatening to ""unleash even dogs for suppression"".

In a report at the time, C. Harrison Kim, a professor at the University of Hawaii, told NK News, a Seoul-based site that monitors North Korea, that although the relationship had waned, Pyongyang's ""alliance with the Black Power movement was a very real thing"".

In 1969 Pyongyang hosted American author and activist Eldridge Cleaver, head of international affairs at the Black Panther Party (BPP), who wrote that North Korea and its ""great leader"" had ""heightened our consciousness to a level that makes us equal to the task of dealing with our number one enemy, the U.S. imperialist aggressors”.

North Korean state media has its own history of issuing racially charged statements.

In 2014, the state news agency published a report saying then-U.S. President Barack Obama ""looks like an African native monkey with a black face"", among other quotes comparing him to an animal.

A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim Jong Un himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.

That report included allegations that North Korea conducts forced abortions on women suspected to have been impregnated by men in China, driven by an underlying belief in a “pure Korean race” in North Korea to which mixed-race children are considered a contamination of its “pureness”.

U.S. band the Killers apologises for bringing Russian fan on stage in Georgia,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - An American alternative-rock band, the Killers, has apologised for bringing a Russian drummer on stage during a show in Georgia and for describing fans as ""brothers and sisters,"" which prompted boos from the audience.

Georgia has a long history of tension with its northern neighbour, exacerbated by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and a subsequent big influx of Russian emigrants escaping their country.

The band, seven times nominated for the music industry's Grammy Awards, performed on Tuesday in the Black Sea resort of Batumi during a European tour.

""Good people of Georgia, it was never our intention to offend anyone!"" the band said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding that it had a longstanding tradition of inviting people to play the drums.

""We recognise that a comment, meant to suggest that all of the Killers' audience and fans are 'brothers and sisters,' could be misconstrued,"" it added.

The reference was to a remark band leader Brandon Flowers made to the crowd, saying he did not want the situation to turn ""angry"".

""I see you as my brothers and my sisters,"" Flowers added to the sound of boos and whistles in a video published by the Russian state RIA news agency.

Videos on social media showed people leaving the show, in addition to the booing.

Georgian public opinion is overwhelmingly pro-Ukrainian.

The band has sold millions of albums, with many songs topping the charts since it formed in the city of Las Vegas in the early 2000s.

Niger says 17 of its soldiers killed in ambush near Burkina Faso border,"NIAMEY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Wednesday said 17 of its soldiers were killed in an ambush by insurgents, the deadliest attack since a July 26 coup whose leaders have cited persistent insecurity as a justification for deposing the civilian government.

The ambush took place on Tuesday about 60 km (40 miles) from the capital Niamey, in a southwestern area that borders Burkina Faso, the defence ministry said, adding that 100 attackers it referred to as ""terrorists"" were killed.

""The swift reaction of the soldiers and the air-land response at the scene of the skirmish enabled the enemy to be dealt with,"" the ministry said.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the main regional bloc, said it had learned with sadness of various attacks by armed groups that had led to the death of ""several"" soldiers. It called on Niger's military leaders to restore constitutional order so they could focus on security, which it said had become increasingly fragile since the coup.

Niger, like other countries in West Africa's Sahel region, has been struggling for years to contain an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes and caused food shortages.

The perceived inability of civilian governments to overcome the problem has been one of the factors in a string of coups in the region, although in the case of Niger the main drivers of the army takeover were internal politics.

Members of the presidential guard, headed by General Abdourahmane Tiani, deposed President Mohamed Bazoum and are still detaining him, defying pressure from the United Nations, ECOWAS and Western powers to reinstate him.

While Tiani said the takeover was necessary to quell the insurgency, analysts say attacks, though still frequent, had been falling under Bazoum, who had tried to engage with Islamists and rural communities where they are rooted.

Niger hosts U.S., French, German and Italian troops as part of international efforts to combat the insurgency, under agreements with the now deposed civilian government.

The future of those foreign contingents is unclear, with the junta using vitriolic anti-French rhetoric and resisting pressure from ECOWAS, the U.N. and Western countries to negotiate a way out of the current situation.

Niger has extra strategic importance to global powers due to its uranium and oil deposits.

Insecurity remains a major problem across the southwest, near the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, both of which also have army governments that took control through coups.

On the Malian side, the departure of French troops last year left a security vacuum that the Islamists have exploited.

Mali's junta brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses. Wagner says it works lawfully.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

Germany walks back plan to meet NATO spending target on annual basis,"Banners displaying the NATO logo are placed at the entrance of new NATO headquarters during the move to the new building, in Brussels, Belgium April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The German government has retreated from a plan to legally commit itself to meeting NATO's 2% military spending target on an annual basis, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday.

A corresponding clause in a draft of the budget financing law passed by the cabinet of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday was deleted at short notice, the source said.

The change means that Germany will be able to stick to its current pledge of meeting the 2% target on average over a five-year period.

This wording is softer than Scholz's original pledge in a speech on Feb 27, 2022, in which he announced a ""Zeitenwende"" or sea change three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""From now on, we will invest more than 2% of the GDP into our defence year after year,"" Scholz said at the time.

A German government spokesperson declined to comment on the particulars of the draft law.

NATO allies have criticised Berlin strongly in the past for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence annually.

It is unclear whether Berlin will keep military spending over this threshold once a 100 billion euro ($101 billion) special fund to bring the Bundeswehr back up to standard is used up.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said he met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy a few weeks ago and agreed to a resolution that could extend current federal government spending for a few months.

""We agreed we should do a CR ... where you just extend the existing funding for a few months so we could work this out, and I thought that was a good sign,"" the chamber's top Democrat told MSNBC, referring to a temporary spending measure known as a continuing resolution.

Current government funding is due to expire Sept. 30 with the fiscal year beginning Oct 1, and no action to fund the federal government could trigger a shutdown.

Any spending measures would have to pass both the Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Schumer warned against McCarthy, a Republican, following hardline members of his party who may be pushing for a shutdown over Ukraine funding and other issues, and noted that there is bipartisan support in the Senate to pass regular appropriations bills to fund the U.S. government.

S. African mother found guilty of murdering three daughters in New Zealand,"WELLINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A jury in New Zealand found a South African woman guilty on Wednesday of murdering her three young daughters, with media saying she faced a life sentence for each killing.

Lauren Anne Dickason killed her two-year-old twins and their six-year-old sister in September 2021 at their home in Timaru, a city of 29,000 on the South Island, about a month after the family had migrated from South Africa.

Media said a majority verdict by a jury of eight women and four men held Dickason was not insane at the time of the killings and was guilty of murder, following a month-long high court trial in the city of Christchurch.

Her husband Graham had found the three children dead and his wife in a serious condition upon arriving home after a dinner with colleagues, New Zealand media have previously said.

The prosecution said Dickason knew when she killed her daughters that what she was doing was morally wrong and the act was murder, according to broadcaster Radio New Zealand.

Some of the jury were heard crying as they left the courtroom, media said.

The judge, Cameron Mander, remanded Dickason to custody in a hospital psychiatric unit until her sentencing. She has been in hospital since the murders.

Any spending measures would have to pass both the Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Schumer warned against McCarthy, a Republican, following hardline members of his party who may be pushing for a shutdown over Ukraine funding and other issues, and noted that there is bipartisan support in the Senate to pass regular appropriations bills to fund the U.S. government.

S. African mother found guilty of murdering three daughters in New Zealand,"WELLINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A jury in New Zealand found a South African woman guilty on Wednesday of murdering her three young daughters, with media saying she faced a life sentence for each killing.

Lauren Anne Dickason killed her two-year-old twins and their six-year-old sister in September 2021 at their home in Timaru, a city of 29,000 on the South Island, about a month after the family had migrated from South Africa.

Media said a majority verdict by a jury of eight women and four men held Dickason was not insane at the time of the killings and was guilty of murder, following a month-long high court trial in the city of Christchurch.

Her husband Graham had found the three children dead and his wife in a serious condition upon arriving home after a dinner with colleagues, New Zealand media have previously said.

The prosecution said Dickason knew when she killed her daughters that what she was doing was morally wrong and the act was murder, according to broadcaster Radio New Zealand.

Some of the jury were heard crying as they left the courtroom, media said.

The judge, Cameron Mander, remanded Dickason to custody in a hospital psychiatric unit until her sentencing. She has been in hospital since the murders.

US housing starts surge in boost to economy,"Construction workers work on a home, as a subdivision of home is built in San Marcos, California, U.S., January 31, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake Acquire Licensing Rights

Summary Single-family housing starts increase 6.7% in July

Single-family building permits rise 0.6%

Overall housing starts climb 3.9%; permits gain 0.1%

Manufacturing production increases 0.5%

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July and permits for future construction rose amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses, but mortgage rates climbing back to near two-decade highs could slow the housing market improvement.

The sharp rebound in groundbreaking on single-family housing units reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was another sign of the economy continuing to defy dire forecasts of a recession. It followed news on Tuesday that retail sales rose strongly in July, which prompted economists to upgrade their growth estimates for the third quarters.

With inflation retreating, economists did not see the flow of upbeat data leading to another interest rate hike next month.

""Housing generally has shown resilience, but Fed officials may overlook this latest news of strengthening demand in the economy when it comes to judging whether to hike rates again this year because of the progress made on the inflation front,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.

Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units last month. They rose 9.5% year-on-year in July. The increase in groundbreaking was led by the West, where single-family starts soared 28.5%.

Starts rose 12.5% in the Midwest. But they fell 3.4% in the Northeast and declined 1.3% in the densely populated South.

After being pummeled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening, the housing market has stabilized. Further improvement, however, looks likely to be curtailed by the renewed increase in mortgage rates.

The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has risen to 6.96% over the past weeks, according to latest data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The rate is within striking distance of the 7.08% seen in late October and early November, which was the highest since April 2002.

Mortgage rates near 7% were attributed to the ebb in confidence among homebuilders in August, with the National Association of Home Builders saying more builders were offering incentives to attract buyers amid expectations of lower sales.

The Fed has since March 2022 raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25% to 5.50% range. Starts for housing projects with five units or more were unchanged at a rate of 460,000 units in July. Demand for rental accommodation, largely driven by higher mortgage rates sidelining some potential home buyers, is slowing. There is also a record stock of multi-family housing under construction.

Overall housing starts increased 3.9% to a rate of 1.452 million units in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.448 million units.

""The need for new single-family homes, which is driven by scarce existing home inventory, should keep a floor under single-family construction,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Homebuilders increased their use of incentives again in August, which may support sales and prevent a steep fall in single-family starts.""

Permits for future construction of single-family homes rose 0.6% in July to a rate of 930,000 units. They have now increased for six straight months and were lifted by rises in the Midwest and South. Single-family building permits, however, tumbled in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West.

Permits for housing projects with five units or more fell 0.2% to a rate of 464,000 units, the lowest level since October 2020. Overall building permits edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.442 million units last month.

Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

TIGHT SUPPLY

Despite the rise in starts, housing supply is likely to remain tight. The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started fell 0.4% to 277,000 units in July.

The single-family homebuilding backlog dropped 0.7% to 140,000 units, while the completions rate for this segment increased 1.3% a rate of 1.018 million units. Overall housing completions dropped 11.8% to a rate of 1.321 million units.

The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 0.7% to a rate of 678,000 units.

The stock of multi-family housing under construction increased 1.1% to 986,000 units, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1970.

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

There was encouraging news on the industrial side of the economy, which has been bruised by the U.S. central bank's rate hikes. Output at factories rebounded 0.5% in July after declining 0.5% in June, the Fed said in a separate report.

The rebound was driven by a 5.2% acceleration in motor vehicle and parts production. But this partly reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. Production typically falls in July when automakers idle plants for retooling. However, the temporary plant closures do not always happen, which could throw off the model that the Fed uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.

Output at mines rose. Utilities production soared 5.4% after three straight monthly declines as a heat-wave across many parts of the country increased demand for air conditioning.

As a result, industrial production shot up 1.0% after dropping 0.8% in June.

""We don't think these strong July increases are fully representative of the underlying trends, because it looks like temporary factors helped boost the July readings,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

Nevertheless, the rise in industrial output bodes well for third-quarter gross domestic product. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised their third-quarter GDP tracking estimate by 0.2 percentage point to a 2.4% annualized rate, citing the strong increases in motor vehicles and utilities production.

The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the second quarter.

Lithuania closes two Belarus border crossings,"VILNIUS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Lithuanian government said on Wednesday it had decided to close two of the country's six border crossing points with Belarus due to ""geopolitical circumstances"", weeks after Russian Wagner Group mercenaries took refuge in the country.

The government did not spell out the circumstances nor threats in its reasoning for closing from Friday the two rural crossing points, which were not used by commercial vehicles.

Over the previous few weeks Lithuanian officials have discouraged its citizens from travelling to Belarus, a close Russian ally, setting up signs at the borders saying: ""Do not risk your safety – do not travel to Belarus. You may fail to come back"".

Neighbouring Poland has closed all but one border crossing point with Belarus this year following the imprisonment of a journalist of Polish origin and expulsions of Polish diplomats.

Latvia, the third EU country bordering Belarus, has two operational crossings.

Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the border on Tuesday, after nearly 100 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross from Belarus in 24 hours.

Poland announced plans last week to move 10,000 additional troops to the Belarus border to support existing guards.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, began crossing from Belarus. They eventually resorted to pushing them back, a policy that is still in place.

The migrants keep appearing at the borders, in significantly smaller numbers.

Travis King case highlights North Korea's history of citing US racism,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea's claim on Wednesday that U.S. soldier Travis King fled racism and abuse in America comes as Pyongyang pushes back on Washington's criticism of the North's human rights record.

North Korea broke nearly a month of silence on King, who is Black, issuing a state media report that he had confessed to illegally and deliberately entering the North, driven by ""ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and disillusionment with inequality in U.S. society.

King has not been directly heard from, but an uncle in United States told media this month his nephew said he experienced racism during his military service.

The state media report comes a day before the United Nations Security Council is due to meet at the behest of Washington to discuss human rights abuses in North Korea.

For decades Pyongyang has highlighted racial discrimination in the United States as what it says is an example of Washington's hypocrisy, and analysts said North Korea is likely to use King's case to resist pressure over human rights.

""North Korea will likely highlight racism in the United States and use it as a means to counter the United States' criticism of North Korea's human rights situation, rather than engaging in negotiations with the U.S.,"" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at South Korea's Kyungnam University.

North Korea highlights racism in the United States to cast a negative light on it, and to make the point that the United States, which regularly points to human rights conditions in other countries, is in no position to do so, said Rachel Minyoung Lee of the U.S.-based Stimson Center.

North Korea's foreign ministry cited racial discrimination, among other ills, in a statement on Tuesday calling it a ""mockery of human rights and deception on the international community"" for the United States to call Thursday's meeting on human rights.

U.S. Army soldier Travis King appears in this unknown location, undated photo obtained by REUTERS /File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

""Not content with conniving at and fostering racial discrimination, gun-related crimes, child maltreatment and forced labour rampant in its society, the U.S. has imposed unethical human rights standards on other countries and fomented internal unrest and confusion,"" the statement said.

In 2018, Pyongyang released a ""White Paper on Human Rights Violations in the U.S."", which accused the administration of Donald Trump of aggravating the ""racial discrimination and misanthropy"" already ""inherent to the social system of the U.S."", citing white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

During the protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, North Korean officials cited ""extreme racists"" in America and criticised authorities' response for threatening to ""unleash even dogs for suppression"".

In a report at the time, C. Harrison Kim, a professor at the University of Hawaii, told NK News, a Seoul-based site that monitors North Korea, that although the relationship had waned, Pyongyang's ""alliance with the Black Power movement was a very real thing"".

In 1969 Pyongyang hosted American author and activist Eldridge Cleaver, head of international affairs at the Black Panther Party (BPP), who wrote that North Korea and its ""great leader"" had ""heightened our consciousness to a level that makes us equal to the task of dealing with our number one enemy, the U.S. imperialist aggressors”.

North Korean state media has its own history of issuing racially charged statements.

In 2014, the state news agency published a report saying then-U.S. President Barack Obama ""looks like an African native monkey with a black face"", among other quotes comparing him to an animal.

A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim Jong Un himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.

That report included allegations that North Korea conducts forced abortions on women suspected to have been impregnated by men in China, driven by an underlying belief in a “pure Korean race” in North Korea to which mixed-race children are considered a contamination of its “pureness”.

U.S. band the Killers apologises for bringing Russian fan on stage in Georgia,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - An American alternative-rock band, the Killers, has apologised for bringing a Russian drummer on stage during a show in Georgia and for describing fans as ""brothers and sisters,"" which prompted boos from the audience.

Georgia has a long history of tension with its northern neighbour, exacerbated by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and a subsequent big influx of Russian emigrants escaping their country.

The band, seven times nominated for the music industry's Grammy Awards, performed on Tuesday in the Black Sea resort of Batumi during a European tour.

""Good people of Georgia, it was never our intention to offend anyone!"" the band said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding that it had a longstanding tradition of inviting people to play the drums.

""We recognise that a comment, meant to suggest that all of the Killers' audience and fans are 'brothers and sisters,' could be misconstrued,"" it added.

The reference was to a remark band leader Brandon Flowers made to the crowd, saying he did not want the situation to turn ""angry"".

""I see you as my brothers and my sisters,"" Flowers added to the sound of boos and whistles in a video published by the Russian state RIA news agency.

Videos on social media showed people leaving the show, in addition to the booing.

Georgian public opinion is overwhelmingly pro-Ukrainian.

The band has sold millions of albums, with many songs topping the charts since it formed in the city of Las Vegas in the early 2000s.

Niger says 17 of its soldiers killed in ambush near Burkina Faso border,"NIAMEY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Wednesday said 17 of its soldiers were killed in an ambush by insurgents, the deadliest attack since a July 26 coup whose leaders have cited persistent insecurity as a justification for deposing the civilian government.

The ambush took place on Tuesday about 60 km (40 miles) from the capital Niamey, in a southwestern area that borders Burkina Faso, the defence ministry said, adding that 100 attackers it referred to as ""terrorists"" were killed.

""The swift reaction of the soldiers and the air-land response at the scene of the skirmish enabled the enemy to be dealt with,"" the ministry said.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the main regional bloc, said it had learned with sadness of various attacks by armed groups that had led to the death of ""several"" soldiers. It called on Niger's military leaders to restore constitutional order so they could focus on security, which it said had become increasingly fragile since the coup.

Niger, like other countries in West Africa's Sahel region, has been struggling for years to contain an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes and caused food shortages.

The perceived inability of civilian governments to overcome the problem has been one of the factors in a string of coups in the region, although in the case of Niger the main drivers of the army takeover were internal politics.

Members of the presidential guard, headed by General Abdourahmane Tiani, deposed President Mohamed Bazoum and are still detaining him, defying pressure from the United Nations, ECOWAS and Western powers to reinstate him.

While Tiani said the takeover was necessary to quell the insurgency, analysts say attacks, though still frequent, had been falling under Bazoum, who had tried to engage with Islamists and rural communities where they are rooted.

Niger hosts U.S., French, German and Italian troops as part of international efforts to combat the insurgency, under agreements with the now deposed civilian government.

The future of those foreign contingents is unclear, with the junta using vitriolic anti-French rhetoric and resisting pressure from ECOWAS, the U.N. and Western countries to negotiate a way out of the current situation.

Niger has extra strategic importance to global powers due to its uranium and oil deposits.

Insecurity remains a major problem across the southwest, near the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, both of which also have army governments that took control through coups.

On the Malian side, the departure of French troops last year left a security vacuum that the Islamists have exploited.

Mali's junta brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses. Wagner says it works lawfully.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

Germany walks back plan to meet NATO spending target on annual basis,"Banners displaying the NATO logo are placed at the entrance of new NATO headquarters during the move to the new building, in Brussels, Belgium April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The German government has retreated from a plan to legally commit itself to meeting NATO's 2% military spending target on an annual basis, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday.

A corresponding clause in a draft of the budget financing law passed by the cabinet of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday was deleted at short notice, the source said.

The change means that Germany will be able to stick to its current pledge of meeting the 2% target on average over a five-year period.

This wording is softer than Scholz's original pledge in a speech on Feb 27, 2022, in which he announced a ""Zeitenwende"" or sea change three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""From now on, we will invest more than 2% of the GDP into our defence year after year,"" Scholz said at the time.

A German government spokesperson declined to comment on the particulars of the draft law.

NATO allies have criticised Berlin strongly in the past for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence annually.

It is unclear whether Berlin will keep military spending over this threshold once a 100 billion euro ($101 billion) special fund to bring the Bundeswehr back up to standard is used up.

Summary Economy hit by dollar shortage, inflation

Officials blame crisis on external shocks

Presidential elections expected by early 2024

CAIRO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - For Egyptians grown used to a decade of reliable power supplies and boasts of vast investments in generation, a wave of rolling blackouts came as a shock - shaking faith in President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's record months before an election.

Along with record inflation and a sharp weakening of the currency, the outages have become a potent symptom of the worst economic crisis to hit Egypt since Sisi took power in 2014 on promises of stability and development.

A former army chief who has overseen a far-reaching crackdown on political dissent, Sisi is widely expected to secure a third term in elections due by early 2024, with the military and other security services in support.

But the country's economic troubles have stirred grumbling among many Egyptians, who are seeing their living standards slide even as the state has spent heavily on mega projects.

""We forgot what a power cut was,"" said Karim Mahrous, a resident of Al-Asmarat, a Cairo neighbourhood of social housing developed under Sisi where people said the power was being cut for an hour at a time.

""When electricity goes off once or twice a day and other places do not even have power cuts that last a quarter of an hour, this is called injustice.""

Power cuts have not been a significant problem since the turmoil that followed the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's 2011 uprising.

At that time, frequent outages helped turn opinion against Egypt's first democratically elected leader, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, before Sisi led his ouster in July 2013.

ECHOES OF THE PAST

Sisi's critics see echoes of that time in the power cuts that began in July and have been implemented according to a published schedule since the start of August. Residents say they have hit some areas harder than others, fuelling a sense of inequality.

""Power cuts are an indication of failure in economic policies and in management,"" said Gameela Ismail, head of Al-Dostour party, one of several marginalized opposition groups trying to press for economic and political change.

""There is a big feeling of danger, because social stability and security are threatened,"" she said.

After 2014 Sisi moved swiftly to create a surplus of power generation capacity, building three giant gas-fired plants as his government leant heavily on heavy financial support from Gulf states and Western-based international lenders.

The government says the load shedding was required because of a surge in electricity consumption for air conditioning during unusually hot weather.

Officials say that alongside hospitals and strategic buildings, areas including the north coast and the Red Sea have been exempted to protect the tourism sector, a key source of foreign currency, which Egypt desperately needs after a chronic dollar shortage was exposed early last year.

Analysts say the electricity cuts are also caused by a dip in Egypt's production of natural gas, which powers most of Egypt's grid, and is another important earner of hard currency.

The government, which has denied that gas shortages triggered the power cuts, started urging people to limit electricity consumption last summer, as it sought to save gas for export while global energy prices were high.

EXTERNAL SHOCKS

Ever since, it has been scrambling to raise dollars through multiple schemes, including from Aug. 14 giving Egyptians abroad one month to deposit money in an Abu Dhabi bank account to gain exemption from military service.

Sisi has blamed current economic problems largely on external shocks including the coronavirus pandemic and the knock-on effects of the war in Ukraine.

""Yes, the Egyptian economy suffers from crises and problems which impacted citizens and their livelihoods, but who doesn't?"" pro-Sisi member of parliament Mostafa Bakry said in an interview.

""We can solve these crises gradually and the Egyptian people can bear the burden.""

Public spending on construction has helped keep the economy in growth and led to a rapid expansion of the road network, but economists say the military's dominant role has stifled reform and the growing debt burden is a cause for concern.

Mega projects like a new capital outside Cairo and summer capital at El Alamein on the breezy north coast, where the elite traditionally spend the hottest months of the year, have also triggered popular ire.

Meanwhile, many Egyptians complain that life has become tougher due to subsidy reforms, taxes and soaring prices.

""Things were much better in the past - there is a huge difference,"" said Mohamed Ibrahim, a civil servant living in Al-Asmarat, lamenting a sharp rise in the cost of cigarettes since Mubarak's time.

Travis King case highlights North Korea's history of citing US racism,"SEOUL, Aug 16 (Reuters) - North Korea's claim on Wednesday that U.S. soldier Travis King fled racism and abuse in America comes as Pyongyang pushes back on Washington's criticism of the North's human rights record.

North Korea broke nearly a month of silence on King, who is Black, issuing a state media report that he had confessed to illegally and deliberately entering the North, driven by ""ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the U.S. Army"" and disillusionment with inequality in U.S. society.

King has not been directly heard from, but an uncle in United States told media this month his nephew said he experienced racism during his military service.

The state media report comes a day before the United Nations Security Council is due to meet at the behest of Washington to discuss human rights abuses in North Korea.

For decades Pyongyang has highlighted racial discrimination in the United States as what it says is an example of Washington's hypocrisy, and analysts said North Korea is likely to use King's case to resist pressure over human rights.

""North Korea will likely highlight racism in the United States and use it as a means to counter the United States' criticism of North Korea's human rights situation, rather than engaging in negotiations with the U.S.,"" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at South Korea's Kyungnam University.

North Korea highlights racism in the United States to cast a negative light on it, and to make the point that the United States, which regularly points to human rights conditions in other countries, is in no position to do so, said Rachel Minyoung Lee of the U.S.-based Stimson Center.

North Korea's foreign ministry cited racial discrimination, among other ills, in a statement on Tuesday calling it a ""mockery of human rights and deception on the international community"" for the United States to call Thursday's meeting on human rights.

""Not content with conniving at and fostering racial discrimination, gun-related crimes, child maltreatment and forced labour rampant in its society, the U.S. has imposed unethical human rights standards on other countries and fomented internal unrest and confusion,"" the statement said.

In 2018, Pyongyang released a ""White Paper on Human Rights Violations in the U.S."", which accused the administration of Donald Trump of aggravating the ""racial discrimination and misanthropy"" already ""inherent to the social system of the U.S."", citing white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

During the protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020, North Korean officials cited ""extreme racists"" in America and criticised authorities' response for threatening to ""unleash even dogs for suppression"".

In a report at the time, C. Harrison Kim, a professor at the University of Hawaii, told NK News, a Seoul-based site that monitors North Korea, that although the relationship had waned, Pyongyang's ""alliance with the Black Power movement was a very real thing"".

In 1969 Pyongyang hosted American author and activist Eldridge Cleaver, head of international affairs at the Black Panther Party (BPP), who wrote that North Korea and its ""great leader"" had ""heightened our consciousness to a level that makes us equal to the task of dealing with our number one enemy, the U.S. imperialist aggressors”.

North Korean state media has its own history of issuing racially charged statements.

In 2014, the state news agency published a report saying then-U.S. President Barack Obama ""looks like an African native monkey with a black face"", among other quotes comparing him to an animal.

A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim Jong Un himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities.

That report included allegations that North Korea conducts forced abortions on women suspected to have been impregnated by men in China, driven by an underlying belief in a “pure Korean race” in North Korea to which mixed-race children are considered a contamination of its “pureness”.

U.S. band the Killers apologises for bringing Russian fan on stage in Georgia,"Aug 16 (Reuters) - An American alternative-rock band, the Killers, has apologised for bringing a Russian drummer on stage during a show in Georgia and for describing fans as ""brothers and sisters,"" which prompted boos from the audience.

Georgia has a long history of tension with its northern neighbour, exacerbated by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and a subsequent big influx of Russian emigrants escaping their country.

The band, seven times nominated for the music industry's Grammy Awards, performed on Tuesday in the Black Sea resort of Batumi during a European tour.

""Good people of Georgia, it was never our intention to offend anyone!"" the band said in a statement on its Facebook page, adding that it had a longstanding tradition of inviting people to play the drums.

""We recognise that a comment, meant to suggest that all of the Killers' audience and fans are 'brothers and sisters,' could be misconstrued,"" it added.

The reference was to a remark band leader Brandon Flowers made to the crowd, saying he did not want the situation to turn ""angry"".

""I see you as my brothers and my sisters,"" Flowers added to the sound of boos and whistles in a video published by the Russian state RIA news agency.

Videos on social media showed people leaving the show, in addition to the booing.

Georgian public opinion is overwhelmingly pro-Ukrainian.

The band has sold millions of albums, with many songs topping the charts since it formed in the city of Las Vegas in the early 2000s.

Niger says 17 of its soldiers killed in ambush near Burkina Faso border,"NIAMEY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Wednesday said 17 of its soldiers were killed in an ambush by insurgents, the deadliest attack since a July 26 coup whose leaders have cited persistent insecurity as a justification for deposing the civilian government.

The ambush took place on Tuesday about 60 km (40 miles) from the capital Niamey, in a southwestern area that borders Burkina Faso, the defence ministry said, adding that 100 attackers it referred to as ""terrorists"" were killed.

""The swift reaction of the soldiers and the air-land response at the scene of the skirmish enabled the enemy to be dealt with,"" the ministry said.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the main regional bloc, said it had learned with sadness of various attacks by armed groups that had led to the death of ""several"" soldiers. It called on Niger's military leaders to restore constitutional order so they could focus on security, which it said had become increasingly fragile since the coup.

Niger, like other countries in West Africa's Sahel region, has been struggling for years to contain an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes and caused food shortages.

The perceived inability of civilian governments to overcome the problem has been one of the factors in a string of coups in the region, although in the case of Niger the main drivers of the army takeover were internal politics.

Members of the presidential guard, headed by General Abdourahmane Tiani, deposed President Mohamed Bazoum and are still detaining him, defying pressure from the United Nations, ECOWAS and Western powers to reinstate him.

While Tiani said the takeover was necessary to quell the insurgency, analysts say attacks, though still frequent, had been falling under Bazoum, who had tried to engage with Islamists and rural communities where they are rooted.

Niger hosts U.S., French, German and Italian troops as part of international efforts to combat the insurgency, under agreements with the now deposed civilian government.

The future of those foreign contingents is unclear, with the junta using vitriolic anti-French rhetoric and resisting pressure from ECOWAS, the U.N. and Western countries to negotiate a way out of the current situation.

Niger has extra strategic importance to global powers due to its uranium and oil deposits.

Insecurity remains a major problem across the southwest, near the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, both of which also have army governments that took control through coups.

On the Malian side, the departure of French troops last year left a security vacuum that the Islamists have exploited.

Mali's junta brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses. Wagner says it works lawfully.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

Germany walks back plan to meet NATO spending target on annual basis,"Banners displaying the NATO logo are placed at the entrance of new NATO headquarters during the move to the new building, in Brussels, Belgium April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The German government has retreated from a plan to legally commit itself to meeting NATO's 2% military spending target on an annual basis, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday.

A corresponding clause in a draft of the budget financing law passed by the cabinet of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday was deleted at short notice, the source said.

The change means that Germany will be able to stick to its current pledge of meeting the 2% target on average over a five-year period.

This wording is softer than Scholz's original pledge in a speech on Feb 27, 2022, in which he announced a ""Zeitenwende"" or sea change three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""From now on, we will invest more than 2% of the GDP into our defence year after year,"" Scholz said at the time.

A German government spokesperson declined to comment on the particulars of the draft law.

NATO allies have criticised Berlin strongly in the past for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence annually.

It is unclear whether Berlin will keep military spending over this threshold once a 100 billion euro ($101 billion) special fund to bring the Bundeswehr back up to standard is used up.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said he met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy a few weeks ago and agreed to a resolution that could extend current federal government spending for a few months.

""We agreed we should do a CR ... where you just extend the existing funding for a few months so we could work this out, and I thought that was a good sign,"" the chamber's top Democrat told MSNBC, referring to a temporary spending measure known as a continuing resolution.

Current government funding is due to expire Sept. 30 with the fiscal year beginning Oct 1, and no action to fund the federal government could trigger a shutdown.

Any spending measures would have to pass both the Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Schumer warned against McCarthy, a Republican, following hardline members of his party who may be pushing for a shutdown over Ukraine funding and other issues, and noted that there is bipartisan support in the Senate to pass regular appropriations bills to fund the U.S. government.

S. African mother found guilty of murdering three daughters in New Zealand,"WELLINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A jury in New Zealand found a South African woman guilty on Wednesday of murdering her three young daughters, with media saying she faced a life sentence for each killing.

Lauren Anne Dickason killed her two-year-old twins and their six-year-old sister in September 2021 at their home in Timaru, a city of 29,000 on the South Island, about a month after the family had migrated from South Africa.

Media said a majority verdict by a jury of eight women and four men held Dickason was not insane at the time of the killings and was guilty of murder, following a month-long high court trial in the city of Christchurch.

Her husband Graham had found the three children dead and his wife in a serious condition upon arriving home after a dinner with colleagues, New Zealand media have previously said.

The prosecution said Dickason knew when she killed her daughters that what she was doing was morally wrong and the act was murder, according to broadcaster Radio New Zealand.

Some of the jury were heard crying as they left the courtroom, media said.

The judge, Cameron Mander, remanded Dickason to custody in a hospital psychiatric unit until her sentencing. She has been in hospital since the murders.

US housing starts surge in boost to economy,"Construction workers work on a home, as a subdivision of home is built in San Marcos, California, U.S., January 31, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake Acquire Licensing Rights

Summary Single-family housing starts increase 6.7% in July

Single-family building permits rise 0.6%

Overall housing starts climb 3.9%; permits gain 0.1%

Manufacturing production increases 0.5%

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July and permits for future construction rose amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses, but mortgage rates climbing back to near two-decade highs could slow the housing market improvement.

The sharp rebound in groundbreaking on single-family housing units reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was another sign of the economy continuing to defy dire forecasts of a recession. It followed news on Tuesday that retail sales rose strongly in July, which prompted economists to upgrade their growth estimates for the third quarters.

With inflation retreating, economists did not see the flow of upbeat data leading to another interest rate hike next month.

""Housing generally has shown resilience, but Fed officials may overlook this latest news of strengthening demand in the economy when it comes to judging whether to hike rates again this year because of the progress made on the inflation front,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.

Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units last month. They rose 9.5% year-on-year in July. The increase in groundbreaking was led by the West, where single-family starts soared 28.5%.

Starts rose 12.5% in the Midwest. But they fell 3.4% in the Northeast and declined 1.3% in the densely populated South.

After being pummeled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening, the housing market has stabilized. Further improvement, however, looks likely to be curtailed by the renewed increase in mortgage rates.

The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has risen to 6.96% over the past weeks, according to latest data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The rate is within striking distance of the 7.08% seen in late October and early November, which was the highest since April 2002.

Mortgage rates near 7% were attributed to the ebb in confidence among homebuilders in August, with the National Association of Home Builders saying more builders were offering incentives to attract buyers amid expectations of lower sales.

The Fed has since March 2022 raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25% to 5.50% range. Starts for housing projects with five units or more were unchanged at a rate of 460,000 units in July. Demand for rental accommodation, largely driven by higher mortgage rates sidelining some potential home buyers, is slowing. There is also a record stock of multi-family housing under construction.

Overall housing starts increased 3.9% to a rate of 1.452 million units in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.448 million units.

""The need for new single-family homes, which is driven by scarce existing home inventory, should keep a floor under single-family construction,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Homebuilders increased their use of incentives again in August, which may support sales and prevent a steep fall in single-family starts.""

Permits for future construction of single-family homes rose 0.6% in July to a rate of 930,000 units. They have now increased for six straight months and were lifted by rises in the Midwest and South. Single-family building permits, however, tumbled in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West.

Permits for housing projects with five units or more fell 0.2% to a rate of 464,000 units, the lowest level since October 2020. Overall building permits edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.442 million units last month.

Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

TIGHT SUPPLY

Despite the rise in starts, housing supply is likely to remain tight. The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started fell 0.4% to 277,000 units in July.

The single-family homebuilding backlog dropped 0.7% to 140,000 units, while the completions rate for this segment increased 1.3% a rate of 1.018 million units. Overall housing completions dropped 11.8% to a rate of 1.321 million units.

The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 0.7% to a rate of 678,000 units.

The stock of multi-family housing under construction increased 1.1% to 986,000 units, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1970.

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

There was encouraging news on the industrial side of the economy, which has been bruised by the U.S. central bank's rate hikes. Output at factories rebounded 0.5% in July after declining 0.5% in June, the Fed said in a separate report.

The rebound was driven by a 5.2% acceleration in motor vehicle and parts production. But this partly reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. Production typically falls in July when automakers idle plants for retooling. However, the temporary plant closures do not always happen, which could throw off the model that the Fed uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.

Output at mines rose. Utilities production soared 5.4% after three straight monthly declines as a heat-wave across many parts of the country increased demand for air conditioning.

As a result, industrial production shot up 1.0% after dropping 0.8% in June.

""We don't think these strong July increases are fully representative of the underlying trends, because it looks like temporary factors helped boost the July readings,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

Nevertheless, the rise in industrial output bodes well for third-quarter gross domestic product. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised their third-quarter GDP tracking estimate by 0.2 percentage point to a 2.4% annualized rate, citing the strong increases in motor vehicles and utilities production.

The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the second quarter.

Summary Economy hit by dollar shortage, inflation

Officials blame crisis on external shocks

Presidential elections expected by early 2024

CAIRO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - For Egyptians grown used to a decade of reliable power supplies and boasts of vast investments in generation, a wave of rolling blackouts came as a shock - shaking faith in President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's record months before an election.

Along with record inflation and a sharp weakening of the currency, the outages have become a potent symptom of the worst economic crisis to hit Egypt since Sisi took power in 2014 on promises of stability and development.

A former army chief who has overseen a far-reaching crackdown on political dissent, Sisi is widely expected to secure a third term in elections due by early 2024, with the military and other security services in support.

But the country's economic troubles have stirred grumbling among many Egyptians, who are seeing their living standards slide even as the state has spent heavily on mega projects.

""We forgot what a power cut was,"" said Karim Mahrous, a resident of Al-Asmarat, a Cairo neighbourhood of social housing developed under Sisi where people said the power was being cut for an hour at a time.

""When electricity goes off once or twice a day and other places do not even have power cuts that last a quarter of an hour, this is called injustice.""

Power cuts have not been a significant problem since the turmoil that followed the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's 2011 uprising.

At that time, frequent outages helped turn opinion against Egypt's first democratically elected leader, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, before Sisi led his ouster in July 2013.

ECHOES OF THE PAST

Sisi's critics see echoes of that time in the power cuts that began in July and have been implemented according to a published schedule since the start of August. Residents say they have hit some areas harder than others, fuelling a sense of inequality.

""Power cuts are an indication of failure in economic policies and in management,"" said Gameela Ismail, head of Al-Dostour party, one of several marginalized opposition groups trying to press for economic and political change.

""There is a big feeling of danger, because social stability and security are threatened,"" she said.

After 2014 Sisi moved swiftly to create a surplus of power generation capacity, building three giant gas-fired plants as his government leant heavily on heavy financial support from Gulf states and Western-based international lenders.

The government says the load shedding was required because of a surge in electricity consumption for air conditioning during unusually hot weather.

Officials say that alongside hospitals and strategic buildings, areas including the north coast and the Red Sea have been exempted to protect the tourism sector, a key source of foreign currency, which Egypt desperately needs after a chronic dollar shortage was exposed early last year.

Analysts say the electricity cuts are also caused by a dip in Egypt's production of natural gas, which powers most of Egypt's grid, and is another important earner of hard currency.

The government, which has denied that gas shortages triggered the power cuts, started urging people to limit electricity consumption last summer, as it sought to save gas for export while global energy prices were high.

EXTERNAL SHOCKS

Ever since, it has been scrambling to raise dollars through multiple schemes, including from Aug. 14 giving Egyptians abroad one month to deposit money in an Abu Dhabi bank account to gain exemption from military service.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. is pushing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia as part of discussions on a broader unwritten understanding between Washington and Tehran to de-escalate tensions, the Financial Times said on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter.

The U.S. is pressing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia, which Moscow is using in the war in Ukraine, as well as spare parts for the unmanned aircraft, the report said, citing an Iranian official and another person familiar with the talks.

The White House and Iran's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The news comes as Washington and Iran are trying to ease tensions and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that he would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

These discussions have taken place alongside the negotiations on a prisoner exchange deal last week, the newspaper said. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from Tehran's Evin prison while a fifth was already under home confinement.

Last week, sources told Reuters that Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said he met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy a few weeks ago and agreed to a resolution that could extend current federal government spending for a few months.

""We agreed we should do a CR ... where you just extend the existing funding for a few months so we could work this out, and I thought that was a good sign,"" the chamber's top Democrat told MSNBC, referring to a temporary spending measure known as a continuing resolution.

Current government funding is due to expire Sept. 30 with the fiscal year beginning Oct 1, and no action to fund the federal government could trigger a shutdown.

Any spending measures would have to pass both the Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Schumer warned against McCarthy, a Republican, following hardline members of his party who may be pushing for a shutdown over Ukraine funding and other issues, and noted that there is bipartisan support in the Senate to pass regular appropriations bills to fund the U.S. government.

S. African mother found guilty of murdering three daughters in New Zealand,"WELLINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A jury in New Zealand found a South African woman guilty on Wednesday of murdering her three young daughters, with media saying she faced a life sentence for each killing.

Lauren Anne Dickason killed her two-year-old twins and their six-year-old sister in September 2021 at their home in Timaru, a city of 29,000 on the South Island, about a month after the family had migrated from South Africa.

Media said a majority verdict by a jury of eight women and four men held Dickason was not insane at the time of the killings and was guilty of murder, following a month-long high court trial in the city of Christchurch.

Her husband Graham had found the three children dead and his wife in a serious condition upon arriving home after a dinner with colleagues, New Zealand media have previously said.

The prosecution said Dickason knew when she killed her daughters that what she was doing was morally wrong and the act was murder, according to broadcaster Radio New Zealand.

Some of the jury were heard crying as they left the courtroom, media said.

The judge, Cameron Mander, remanded Dickason to custody in a hospital psychiatric unit until her sentencing. She has been in hospital since the murders.

US housing starts surge in boost to economy,"Construction workers work on a home, as a subdivision of home is built in San Marcos, California, U.S., January 31, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake Acquire Licensing Rights

Summary Single-family housing starts increase 6.7% in July

Single-family building permits rise 0.6%

Overall housing starts climb 3.9%; permits gain 0.1%

Manufacturing production increases 0.5%

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July and permits for future construction rose amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses, but mortgage rates climbing back to near two-decade highs could slow the housing market improvement.

The sharp rebound in groundbreaking on single-family housing units reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was another sign of the economy continuing to defy dire forecasts of a recession. It followed news on Tuesday that retail sales rose strongly in July, which prompted economists to upgrade their growth estimates for the third quarters.

With inflation retreating, economists did not see the flow of upbeat data leading to another interest rate hike next month.

""Housing generally has shown resilience, but Fed officials may overlook this latest news of strengthening demand in the economy when it comes to judging whether to hike rates again this year because of the progress made on the inflation front,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.

Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units last month. They rose 9.5% year-on-year in July. The increase in groundbreaking was led by the West, where single-family starts soared 28.5%.

Starts rose 12.5% in the Midwest. But they fell 3.4% in the Northeast and declined 1.3% in the densely populated South.

After being pummeled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening, the housing market has stabilized. Further improvement, however, looks likely to be curtailed by the renewed increase in mortgage rates.

The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has risen to 6.96% over the past weeks, according to latest data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The rate is within striking distance of the 7.08% seen in late October and early November, which was the highest since April 2002.

Mortgage rates near 7% were attributed to the ebb in confidence among homebuilders in August, with the National Association of Home Builders saying more builders were offering incentives to attract buyers amid expectations of lower sales.

The Fed has since March 2022 raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25% to 5.50% range. Starts for housing projects with five units or more were unchanged at a rate of 460,000 units in July. Demand for rental accommodation, largely driven by higher mortgage rates sidelining some potential home buyers, is slowing. There is also a record stock of multi-family housing under construction.

Overall housing starts increased 3.9% to a rate of 1.452 million units in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.448 million units.

""The need for new single-family homes, which is driven by scarce existing home inventory, should keep a floor under single-family construction,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Homebuilders increased their use of incentives again in August, which may support sales and prevent a steep fall in single-family starts.""

Permits for future construction of single-family homes rose 0.6% in July to a rate of 930,000 units. They have now increased for six straight months and were lifted by rises in the Midwest and South. Single-family building permits, however, tumbled in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West.

Permits for housing projects with five units or more fell 0.2% to a rate of 464,000 units, the lowest level since October 2020. Overall building permits edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.442 million units last month.

Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

TIGHT SUPPLY

Despite the rise in starts, housing supply is likely to remain tight. The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started fell 0.4% to 277,000 units in July.

The single-family homebuilding backlog dropped 0.7% to 140,000 units, while the completions rate for this segment increased 1.3% a rate of 1.018 million units. Overall housing completions dropped 11.8% to a rate of 1.321 million units.

The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 0.7% to a rate of 678,000 units.

The stock of multi-family housing under construction increased 1.1% to 986,000 units, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1970.

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

There was encouraging news on the industrial side of the economy, which has been bruised by the U.S. central bank's rate hikes. Output at factories rebounded 0.5% in July after declining 0.5% in June, the Fed said in a separate report.

The rebound was driven by a 5.2% acceleration in motor vehicle and parts production. But this partly reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. Production typically falls in July when automakers idle plants for retooling. However, the temporary plant closures do not always happen, which could throw off the model that the Fed uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.

Output at mines rose. Utilities production soared 5.4% after three straight monthly declines as a heat-wave across many parts of the country increased demand for air conditioning.

As a result, industrial production shot up 1.0% after dropping 0.8% in June.

""We don't think these strong July increases are fully representative of the underlying trends, because it looks like temporary factors helped boost the July readings,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

Nevertheless, the rise in industrial output bodes well for third-quarter gross domestic product. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised their third-quarter GDP tracking estimate by 0.2 percentage point to a 2.4% annualized rate, citing the strong increases in motor vehicles and utilities production.

The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the second quarter.

Summary Economy hit by dollar shortage, inflation

Officials blame crisis on external shocks

Presidential elections expected by early 2024

CAIRO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - For Egyptians grown used to a decade of reliable power supplies and boasts of vast investments in generation, a wave of rolling blackouts came as a shock - shaking faith in President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's record months before an election.

Along with record inflation and a sharp weakening of the currency, the outages have become a potent symptom of the worst economic crisis to hit Egypt since Sisi took power in 2014 on promises of stability and development.

A former army chief who has overseen a far-reaching crackdown on political dissent, Sisi is widely expected to secure a third term in elections due by early 2024, with the military and other security services in support.

But the country's economic troubles have stirred grumbling among many Egyptians, who are seeing their living standards slide even as the state has spent heavily on mega projects.

""We forgot what a power cut was,"" said Karim Mahrous, a resident of Al-Asmarat, a Cairo neighbourhood of social housing developed under Sisi where people said the power was being cut for an hour at a time.

""When electricity goes off once or twice a day and other places do not even have power cuts that last a quarter of an hour, this is called injustice.""

Power cuts have not been a significant problem since the turmoil that followed the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's 2011 uprising.

At that time, frequent outages helped turn opinion against Egypt's first democratically elected leader, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, before Sisi led his ouster in July 2013.

ECHOES OF THE PAST

Sisi's critics see echoes of that time in the power cuts that began in July and have been implemented according to a published schedule since the start of August. Residents say they have hit some areas harder than others, fuelling a sense of inequality.

""Power cuts are an indication of failure in economic policies and in management,"" said Gameela Ismail, head of Al-Dostour party, one of several marginalized opposition groups trying to press for economic and political change.

""There is a big feeling of danger, because social stability and security are threatened,"" she said.

After 2014 Sisi moved swiftly to create a surplus of power generation capacity, building three giant gas-fired plants as his government leant heavily on heavy financial support from Gulf states and Western-based international lenders.

The government says the load shedding was required because of a surge in electricity consumption for air conditioning during unusually hot weather.

Officials say that alongside hospitals and strategic buildings, areas including the north coast and the Red Sea have been exempted to protect the tourism sector, a key source of foreign currency, which Egypt desperately needs after a chronic dollar shortage was exposed early last year.

Analysts say the electricity cuts are also caused by a dip in Egypt's production of natural gas, which powers most of Egypt's grid, and is another important earner of hard currency.

The government, which has denied that gas shortages triggered the power cuts, started urging people to limit electricity consumption last summer, as it sought to save gas for export while global energy prices were high.

EXTERNAL SHOCKS

Ever since, it has been scrambling to raise dollars through multiple schemes, including from Aug. 14 giving Egyptians abroad one month to deposit money in an Abu Dhabi bank account to gain exemption from military service.

Sisi has blamed current economic problems largely on external shocks including the coronavirus pandemic and the knock-on effects of the war in Ukraine.

""Yes, the Egyptian economy suffers from crises and problems which impacted citizens and their livelihoods, but who doesn't?"" pro-Sisi member of parliament Mostafa Bakry said in an interview.

""We can solve these crises gradually and the Egyptian people can bear the burden.""

Public spending on construction has helped keep the economy in growth and led to a rapid expansion of the road network, but economists say the military's dominant role has stifled reform and the growing debt burden is a cause for concern.

Mega projects like a new capital outside Cairo and summer capital at El Alamein on the breezy north coast, where the elite traditionally spend the hottest months of the year, have also triggered popular ire.

Meanwhile, many Egyptians complain that life has become tougher due to subsidy reforms, taxes and soaring prices.

""Things were much better in the past - there is a huge difference,"" said Mohamed Ibrahim, a civil servant living in Al-Asmarat, lamenting a sharp rise in the cost of cigarettes since Mubarak's time.

US asks Iran to stop selling drones to Russia-FT,"[1/2] An image shows Iranian drone transfer to Russia, as evidence of new Russian-Iran cooperation, in this handout acquired June 9, 2023. White House/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. is pushing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia as part of discussions on a broader unwritten understanding between Washington and Tehran to de-escalate tensions, the Financial Times said on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter.

The U.S. is pressing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia, which Moscow is using in the war in Ukraine, as well as spare parts for the unmanned aircraft, the report said, citing an Iranian official and another person familiar with the talks.

The White House and Iran's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The news comes as Washington and Iran are trying to ease tensions and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that he would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

These discussions have taken place alongside the negotiations on a prisoner exchange deal last week, the newspaper said. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from Tehran's Evin prison while a fifth was already under home confinement.

Last week, sources told Reuters that Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea.

Chinese duties on U.S. imports 'inconsistent' with WTO obligations,"A logo is seen at the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters before a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, October 5, 2022. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

GENEVA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel on Wednesday found that China had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations by imposing additional duties on certain U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.

The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it was pleased with the WTO decision, adding that China had ""illegally retaliated with sham 'safeguard' tariffs.""

China's Commerce Ministry said it had noted the WTO panel decision and demanded that the United States immediately lift tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium imports.

The U.S. imposed a 25% duty on steel imports and a 10% duty on aluminium imports in March 2018 based on the Donald Trump administration's ""Section 232"" national security investigation into steel and aluminium imports.

The panel recommended that China bring its ""WTO-inconsistent measures into conformity"".

Beijing could appeal the ruling, which would send it into a legal void because Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, rendering it incapable of giving a judgment.

The WTO ruled last year that the U.S. move had also violated international trade rules, with Washington also appealing the decision.

In response to the U.S. duties, China announced that additional duties of between 15% and 25% would apply to certain imports originating in the United States, a measure challenged by Washington.

The United States agreed to remove tariffs on EU imports in 2021 but President Joe Biden's administration has otherwise kept in place the metals tariffs that were one of the centrepieces of Trump's America First strategy.

Niger says 17 of its soldiers killed in ambush near Burkina Faso border,"NIAMEY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Wednesday said 17 of its soldiers were killed in an ambush by insurgents, the deadliest attack since a July 26 coup whose leaders have cited persistent insecurity as a justification for deposing the civilian government.

The ambush took place on Tuesday about 60 km (40 miles) from the capital Niamey, in a southwestern area that borders Burkina Faso, the defence ministry said, adding that 100 attackers it referred to as ""terrorists"" were killed.

""The swift reaction of the soldiers and the air-land response at the scene of the skirmish enabled the enemy to be dealt with,"" the ministry said.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the main regional bloc, said it had learned with sadness of various attacks by armed groups that had led to the death of ""several"" soldiers. It called on Niger's military leaders to restore constitutional order so they could focus on security, which it said had become increasingly fragile since the coup.

Niger, like other countries in West Africa's Sahel region, has been struggling for years to contain an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes and caused food shortages.

The perceived inability of civilian governments to overcome the problem has been one of the factors in a string of coups in the region, although in the case of Niger the main drivers of the army takeover were internal politics.

Members of the presidential guard, headed by General Abdourahmane Tiani, deposed President Mohamed Bazoum and are still detaining him, defying pressure from the United Nations, ECOWAS and Western powers to reinstate him.

While Tiani said the takeover was necessary to quell the insurgency, analysts say attacks, though still frequent, had been falling under Bazoum, who had tried to engage with Islamists and rural communities where they are rooted.

Niger hosts U.S., French, German and Italian troops as part of international efforts to combat the insurgency, under agreements with the now deposed civilian government.

The future of those foreign contingents is unclear, with the junta using vitriolic anti-French rhetoric and resisting pressure from ECOWAS, the U.N. and Western countries to negotiate a way out of the current situation.

Niger has extra strategic importance to global powers due to its uranium and oil deposits.

Insecurity remains a major problem across the southwest, near the border with Mali and Burkina Faso, both of which also have army governments that took control through coups.

On the Malian side, the departure of French troops last year left a security vacuum that the Islamists have exploited.

Mali's junta brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses. Wagner says it works lawfully.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

Germany walks back plan to meet NATO spending target on annual basis,"Banners displaying the NATO logo are placed at the entrance of new NATO headquarters during the move to the new building, in Brussels, Belgium April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The German government has retreated from a plan to legally commit itself to meeting NATO's 2% military spending target on an annual basis, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday.

A corresponding clause in a draft of the budget financing law passed by the cabinet of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday was deleted at short notice, the source said.

The change means that Germany will be able to stick to its current pledge of meeting the 2% target on average over a five-year period.

This wording is softer than Scholz's original pledge in a speech on Feb 27, 2022, in which he announced a ""Zeitenwende"" or sea change three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""From now on, we will invest more than 2% of the GDP into our defence year after year,"" Scholz said at the time.

A German government spokesperson declined to comment on the particulars of the draft law.

NATO allies have criticised Berlin strongly in the past for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence annually.

It is unclear whether Berlin will keep military spending over this threshold once a 100 billion euro ($101 billion) special fund to bring the Bundeswehr back up to standard is used up.

""When electricity goes off once or twice a day and other places do not even have power cuts that last a quarter of an hour, this is called injustice.""

Power cuts have not been a significant problem since the turmoil that followed the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's 2011 uprising.

At that time, frequent outages helped turn opinion against Egypt's first democratically elected leader, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, before Sisi led his ouster in July 2013.

ECHOES OF THE PAST

Sisi's critics see echoes of that time in the power cuts that began in July and have been implemented according to a published schedule since the start of August. Residents say they have hit some areas harder than others, fuelling a sense of inequality.

""Power cuts are an indication of failure in economic policies and in management,"" said Gameela Ismail, head of Al-Dostour party, one of several marginalized opposition groups trying to press for economic and political change.

""There is a big feeling of danger, because social stability and security are threatened,"" she said.

After 2014 Sisi moved swiftly to create a surplus of power generation capacity, building three giant gas-fired plants as his government leant heavily on heavy financial support from Gulf states and Western-based international lenders.

The government says the load shedding was required because of a surge in electricity consumption for air conditioning during unusually hot weather.

Officials say that alongside hospitals and strategic buildings, areas including the north coast and the Red Sea have been exempted to protect the tourism sector, a key source of foreign currency, which Egypt desperately needs after a chronic dollar shortage was exposed early last year.

Analysts say the electricity cuts are also caused by a dip in Egypt's production of natural gas, which powers most of Egypt's grid, and is another important earner of hard currency.

The government, which has denied that gas shortages triggered the power cuts, started urging people to limit electricity consumption last summer, as it sought to save gas for export while global energy prices were high.

EXTERNAL SHOCKS

Ever since, it has been scrambling to raise dollars through multiple schemes, including from Aug. 14 giving Egyptians abroad one month to deposit money in an Abu Dhabi bank account to gain exemption from military service.

Sisi has blamed current economic problems largely on external shocks including the coronavirus pandemic and the knock-on effects of the war in Ukraine.

""Yes, the Egyptian economy suffers from crises and problems which impacted citizens and their livelihoods, but who doesn't?"" pro-Sisi member of parliament Mostafa Bakry said in an interview.

""We can solve these crises gradually and the Egyptian people can bear the burden.""

Public spending on construction has helped keep the economy in growth and led to a rapid expansion of the road network, but economists say the military's dominant role has stifled reform and the growing debt burden is a cause for concern.

Mega projects like a new capital outside Cairo and summer capital at El Alamein on the breezy north coast, where the elite traditionally spend the hottest months of the year, have also triggered popular ire.

Meanwhile, many Egyptians complain that life has become tougher due to subsidy reforms, taxes and soaring prices.

""Things were much better in the past - there is a huge difference,"" said Mohamed Ibrahim, a civil servant living in Al-Asmarat, lamenting a sharp rise in the cost of cigarettes since Mubarak's time.

US asks Iran to stop selling drones to Russia-FT,"[1/2] An image shows Iranian drone transfer to Russia, as evidence of new Russian-Iran cooperation, in this handout acquired June 9, 2023. White House/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. is pushing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia as part of discussions on a broader unwritten understanding between Washington and Tehran to de-escalate tensions, the Financial Times said on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter.

The U.S. is pressing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia, which Moscow is using in the war in Ukraine, as well as spare parts for the unmanned aircraft, the report said, citing an Iranian official and another person familiar with the talks.

The White House and Iran's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The news comes as Washington and Iran are trying to ease tensions and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that he would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

These discussions have taken place alongside the negotiations on a prisoner exchange deal last week, the newspaper said. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from Tehran's Evin prison while a fifth was already under home confinement.

Last week, sources told Reuters that Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea.

Chinese duties on U.S. imports 'inconsistent' with WTO obligations,"A logo is seen at the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters before a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, October 5, 2022. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

GENEVA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel on Wednesday found that China had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations by imposing additional duties on certain U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.

The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it was pleased with the WTO decision, adding that China had ""illegally retaliated with sham 'safeguard' tariffs.""

China's Commerce Ministry said it had noted the WTO panel decision and demanded that the United States immediately lift tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium imports.

The U.S. imposed a 25% duty on steel imports and a 10% duty on aluminium imports in March 2018 based on the Donald Trump administration's ""Section 232"" national security investigation into steel and aluminium imports.

The panel recommended that China bring its ""WTO-inconsistent measures into conformity"".

Beijing could appeal the ruling, which would send it into a legal void because Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, rendering it incapable of giving a judgment.

The WTO ruled last year that the U.S. move had also violated international trade rules, with Washington also appealing the decision.

In response to the U.S. duties, China announced that additional duties of between 15% and 25% would apply to certain imports originating in the United States, a measure challenged by Washington.

The United States agreed to remove tariffs on EU imports in 2021 but President Joe Biden's administration has otherwise kept in place the metals tariffs that were one of the centrepieces of Trump's America First strategy.

Europe space chief warns over political wavering on climate,"A satellite image, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission, shows a wildfire that broke out on August 5 south of Odemira in the Alentejo region in southern Portugal, as seen on August 7, 2023. The European Space Agency /Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

PARIS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Europe's top space official has urged wavering politicians not to abandon European leadership in combating climate change, saying record heatwaves and vegetation fires provide ""really alarming"" evidence of the pace of global warming.

""It is clear that climate change is very visible and is really causing enormous changes to our planet,"" Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency and a leading expert on environmental observation, told Reuters.

Greece, Italy, Spain and most recently Portugal have grappled with record-breaking temperatures and wildfires this summer.

The World Meterological Organization said July had the highest global average temperature for any month on record.

""This is really alarming,"" Aschbacher said. ""It just confirms that climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, to humankind, and will remain so for the next decades and we do need to do everything we can to mitigate the effects.""

Until 2021, when he stepped up to run the 22-nation agency, Aschbacher ran ESA's flagship Earth observation satellite activities including Copernicus, which the Paris-based agency says is the world's largest environmental monitoring effort.

ESA last week released a Copernicus image of a wildfire that razed thousands of hectares of forest in southern Portugal - a blaze that has since been brought under control.

Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves more frequent, intense and likely to happen across seasons, not just in what were regarded as the summer months.

But pressure is growing on some governments over the cost of net-zero commitments on emissions, and analysts say looming elections in Europe could put future measures at risk.

In Britain, where general elections are scheduled within 18 months, Prime Mininster Rishi Sunak has warned of climate policies that ""unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs"".

Ashbacher said long-term costs were likely to be far higher unless governments respond to ""crystal clear"" evidence, including satellite measurements, of the recent heat emergency in southern Europe.

""Acting now is much cheaper than waiting for years and then patching up the damage that has been caused,"" he said when asked if he saw any signs of drift in Europe's climate agenda.

""So yes, the alarm bells should still be ringing very loud. And it is certainly concerning if the signals are not heard in politics as they should be heard, in order to really save our planet."" He did not single out specific politicians or states.

FUNDING GAP AND 'GLOBAL BOILING'

Aschbacher is among the most senior climate-monitoring officials to voice concerns over wavering support for measures to combat climate change - a creeping negative reaction that some climate activists have labelled ""greenlash"".

After scientists declared July the world's hottest month on record, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said ""the era of global boiling has arrived"".

ESA's Copernicus programme involves six families of Sentinel satellites designed to read the planet's ""vital signs"" from carbon dioxide to wave height or land and ocean temperatures.

Plans for six more ""Sentinel Expansion"" missions starting from 2026 are in flux because of a funding gap of 721 million euros ($787.84 million), stemming mainly from the partial loss of UK contributions following its exit from the European Union.

Negotiations have been under way for months between Britain and the European Commission over whether and to what extent Britain should continue to contribute funds to Copernicus via the EU, which co-leads the satellite programme alongside ESA.

Britain's smaller direct contribution to Copernicus as one of the core member nations of ESA itself is unaffected.

Britain's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Although it is not part of the talks, Aschbacher said ESA needs a funding decision by June 2024 ""to continue development of the next set of Sentinel satellites in an uninterrupted way"".

Failure to meet that deadline would kick the funding decision into the next planning period from 2028, Aschbacher said. Suspending work on the next round of satellites would also drive up costs by damaging continuity and send the wrong message about Europe's leadership on climate issues, he said.

""The impact would be very significant because the Sentinels are required in order to provide a number of critical climate parameters. This would significantly impact Europe’s commitment to combating climate change.""

Germany walks back plan to meet NATO spending target on annual basis,"Banners displaying the NATO logo are placed at the entrance of new NATO headquarters during the move to the new building, in Brussels, Belgium April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The German government has retreated from a plan to legally commit itself to meeting NATO's 2% military spending target on an annual basis, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday.

A corresponding clause in a draft of the budget financing law passed by the cabinet of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday was deleted at short notice, the source said.

The change means that Germany will be able to stick to its current pledge of meeting the 2% target on average over a five-year period.

This wording is softer than Scholz's original pledge in a speech on Feb 27, 2022, in which he announced a ""Zeitenwende"" or sea change three days after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""From now on, we will invest more than 2% of the GDP into our defence year after year,"" Scholz said at the time.

A German government spokesperson declined to comment on the particulars of the draft law.

NATO allies have criticised Berlin strongly in the past for not spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence annually.

It is unclear whether Berlin will keep military spending over this threshold once a 100 billion euro ($101 billion) special fund to bring the Bundeswehr back up to standard is used up.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said he met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy a few weeks ago and agreed to a resolution that could extend current federal government spending for a few months.

""We agreed we should do a CR ... where you just extend the existing funding for a few months so we could work this out, and I thought that was a good sign,"" the chamber's top Democrat told MSNBC, referring to a temporary spending measure known as a continuing resolution.

Current government funding is due to expire Sept. 30 with the fiscal year beginning Oct 1, and no action to fund the federal government could trigger a shutdown.

Any spending measures would have to pass both the Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Schumer warned against McCarthy, a Republican, following hardline members of his party who may be pushing for a shutdown over Ukraine funding and other issues, and noted that there is bipartisan support in the Senate to pass regular appropriations bills to fund the U.S. government.

S. African mother found guilty of murdering three daughters in New Zealand,"WELLINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A jury in New Zealand found a South African woman guilty on Wednesday of murdering her three young daughters, with media saying she faced a life sentence for each killing.

Lauren Anne Dickason killed her two-year-old twins and their six-year-old sister in September 2021 at their home in Timaru, a city of 29,000 on the South Island, about a month after the family had migrated from South Africa.

Media said a majority verdict by a jury of eight women and four men held Dickason was not insane at the time of the killings and was guilty of murder, following a month-long high court trial in the city of Christchurch.

Her husband Graham had found the three children dead and his wife in a serious condition upon arriving home after a dinner with colleagues, New Zealand media have previously said.

The prosecution said Dickason knew when she killed her daughters that what she was doing was morally wrong and the act was murder, according to broadcaster Radio New Zealand.

Some of the jury were heard crying as they left the courtroom, media said.

The judge, Cameron Mander, remanded Dickason to custody in a hospital psychiatric unit until her sentencing. She has been in hospital since the murders.

Summary Single-family housing starts increase 6.7% in July

Single-family building permits rise 0.6%

Overall housing starts climb 3.9%; permits gain 0.1%

Manufacturing production increases 0.5%

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July and permits for future construction rose amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses, but mortgage rates climbing back to near two-decade highs could slow the housing market improvement.

The sharp rebound in groundbreaking on single-family housing units reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was another sign of the economy continuing to defy dire forecasts of a recession. It followed news on Tuesday that retail sales rose strongly in July, which prompted economists to upgrade their growth estimates for the third quarters.

With inflation retreating, economists did not see the flow of upbeat data leading to another interest rate hike next month.

""Housing generally has shown resilience, but Fed officials may overlook this latest news of strengthening demand in the economy when it comes to judging whether to hike rates again this year because of the progress made on the inflation front,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.

Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units last month. They rose 9.5% year-on-year in July. The increase in groundbreaking was led by the West, where single-family starts soared 28.5%.

Starts rose 12.5% in the Midwest. But they fell 3.4% in the Northeast and declined 1.3% in the densely populated South.

After being pummeled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening, the housing market has stabilized. Further improvement, however, looks likely to be curtailed by the renewed increase in mortgage rates.

The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has risen to 6.96% over the past weeks, according to latest data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The rate is within striking distance of the 7.08% seen in late October and early November, which was the highest since April 2002.

Mortgage rates near 7% were attributed to the ebb in confidence among homebuilders in August, with the National Association of Home Builders saying more builders were offering incentives to attract buyers amid expectations of lower sales.

The Fed has since March 2022 raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25% to 5.50% range. Starts for housing projects with five units or more were unchanged at a rate of 460,000 units in July. Demand for rental accommodation, largely driven by higher mortgage rates sidelining some potential home buyers, is slowing. There is also a record stock of multi-family housing under construction.

Overall housing starts increased 3.9% to a rate of 1.452 million units in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.448 million units.

""The need for new single-family homes, which is driven by scarce existing home inventory, should keep a floor under single-family construction,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Homebuilders increased their use of incentives again in August, which may support sales and prevent a steep fall in single-family starts.""

Permits for future construction of single-family homes rose 0.6% in July to a rate of 930,000 units. They have now increased for six straight months and were lifted by rises in the Midwest and South. Single-family building permits, however, tumbled in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West.

Permits for housing projects with five units or more fell 0.2% to a rate of 464,000 units, the lowest level since October 2020. Overall building permits edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.442 million units last month.

Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

TIGHT SUPPLY

Despite the rise in starts, housing supply is likely to remain tight. The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started fell 0.4% to 277,000 units in July.

The single-family homebuilding backlog dropped 0.7% to 140,000 units, while the completions rate for this segment increased 1.3% a rate of 1.018 million units. Overall housing completions dropped 11.8% to a rate of 1.321 million units.

The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 0.7% to a rate of 678,000 units.

The stock of multi-family housing under construction increased 1.1% to 986,000 units, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1970.

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

There was encouraging news on the industrial side of the economy, which has been bruised by the U.S. central bank's rate hikes. Output at factories rebounded 0.5% in July after declining 0.5% in June, the Fed said in a separate report.

The rebound was driven by a 5.2% acceleration in motor vehicle and parts production. But this partly reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. Production typically falls in July when automakers idle plants for retooling. However, the temporary plant closures do not always happen, which could throw off the model that the Fed uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.

Output at mines rose. Utilities production soared 5.4% after three straight monthly declines as a heat-wave across many parts of the country increased demand for air conditioning.

As a result, industrial production shot up 1.0% after dropping 0.8% in June.

""We don't think these strong July increases are fully representative of the underlying trends, because it looks like temporary factors helped boost the July readings,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

Nevertheless, the rise in industrial output bodes well for third-quarter gross domestic product. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised their third-quarter GDP tracking estimate by 0.2 percentage point to a 2.4% annualized rate, citing the strong increases in motor vehicles and utilities production.

The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the second quarter.

Summary Economy hit by dollar shortage, inflation

Officials blame crisis on external shocks

Presidential elections expected by early 2024

CAIRO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - For Egyptians grown used to a decade of reliable power supplies and boasts of vast investments in generation, a wave of rolling blackouts came as a shock - shaking faith in President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's record months before an election.

Along with record inflation and a sharp weakening of the currency, the outages have become a potent symptom of the worst economic crisis to hit Egypt since Sisi took power in 2014 on promises of stability and development.

A former army chief who has overseen a far-reaching crackdown on political dissent, Sisi is widely expected to secure a third term in elections due by early 2024, with the military and other security services in support.

But the country's economic troubles have stirred grumbling among many Egyptians, who are seeing their living standards slide even as the state has spent heavily on mega projects.

""We forgot what a power cut was,"" said Karim Mahrous, a resident of Al-Asmarat, a Cairo neighbourhood of social housing developed under Sisi where people said the power was being cut for an hour at a time.

Plans for six more ""Sentinel Expansion"" missions starting from 2026 are in flux because of a funding gap of 721 million euros ($787.84 million), stemming mainly from the partial loss of UK contributions following its exit from the European Union.

Negotiations have been under way for months between Britain and the European Commission over whether and to what extent Britain should continue to contribute funds to Copernicus via the EU, which co-leads the satellite programme alongside ESA.

Britain's smaller direct contribution to Copernicus as one of the core member nations of ESA itself is unaffected.

Britain's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Although it is not part of the talks, Aschbacher said ESA needs a funding decision by June 2024 ""to continue development of the next set of Sentinel satellites in an uninterrupted way"".

Failure to meet that deadline would kick the funding decision into the next planning period from 2028, Aschbacher said. Suspending work on the next round of satellites would also drive up costs by damaging continuity and send the wrong message about Europe's leadership on climate issues, he said.

""The impact would be very significant because the Sentinels are required in order to provide a number of critical climate parameters. This would significantly impact Europe’s commitment to combating climate change.""

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said he met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy a few weeks ago and agreed to a resolution that could extend current federal government spending for a few months.

""We agreed we should do a CR ... where you just extend the existing funding for a few months so we could work this out, and I thought that was a good sign,"" the chamber's top Democrat told MSNBC, referring to a temporary spending measure known as a continuing resolution.

Current government funding is due to expire Sept. 30 with the fiscal year beginning Oct 1, and no action to fund the federal government could trigger a shutdown.

Any spending measures would have to pass both the Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.

Schumer warned against McCarthy, a Republican, following hardline members of his party who may be pushing for a shutdown over Ukraine funding and other issues, and noted that there is bipartisan support in the Senate to pass regular appropriations bills to fund the U.S. government.

S. African mother found guilty of murdering three daughters in New Zealand,"WELLINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A jury in New Zealand found a South African woman guilty on Wednesday of murdering her three young daughters, with media saying she faced a life sentence for each killing.

Lauren Anne Dickason killed her two-year-old twins and their six-year-old sister in September 2021 at their home in Timaru, a city of 29,000 on the South Island, about a month after the family had migrated from South Africa.

Media said a majority verdict by a jury of eight women and four men held Dickason was not insane at the time of the killings and was guilty of murder, following a month-long high court trial in the city of Christchurch.

US housing starts surge in boost to economy,"Construction workers work on a home, as a subdivision of home is built in San Marcos, California, U.S., January 31, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake Acquire Licensing Rights

Summary Single-family housing starts increase 6.7% in July

Single-family building permits rise 0.6%

Overall housing starts climb 3.9%; permits gain 0.1%

Manufacturing production increases 0.5%

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July and permits for future construction rose amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses, but mortgage rates climbing back to near two-decade highs could slow the housing market improvement.

The sharp rebound in groundbreaking on single-family housing units reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was another sign of the economy continuing to defy dire forecasts of a recession. It followed news on Tuesday that retail sales rose strongly in July, which prompted economists to upgrade their growth estimates for the third quarters.

With inflation retreating, economists did not see the flow of upbeat data leading to another interest rate hike next month.

""Housing generally has shown resilience, but Fed officials may overlook this latest news of strengthening demand in the economy when it comes to judging whether to hike rates again this year because of the progress made on the inflation front,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.

Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units last month. They rose 9.5% year-on-year in July. The increase in groundbreaking was led by the West, where single-family starts soared 28.5%.

Starts rose 12.5% in the Midwest. But they fell 3.4% in the Northeast and declined 1.3% in the densely populated South.

After being pummeled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening, the housing market has stabilized. Further improvement, however, looks likely to be curtailed by the renewed increase in mortgage rates.

The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has risen to 6.96% over the past weeks, according to latest data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The rate is within striking distance of the 7.08% seen in late October and early November, which was the highest since April 2002.

Mortgage rates near 7% were attributed to the ebb in confidence among homebuilders in August, with the National Association of Home Builders saying more builders were offering incentives to attract buyers amid expectations of lower sales.

The Fed has since March 2022 raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25% to 5.50% range. Starts for housing projects with five units or more were unchanged at a rate of 460,000 units in July. Demand for rental accommodation, largely driven by higher mortgage rates sidelining some potential home buyers, is slowing. There is also a record stock of multi-family housing under construction.

Overall housing starts increased 3.9% to a rate of 1.452 million units in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.448 million units.

""The need for new single-family homes, which is driven by scarce existing home inventory, should keep a floor under single-family construction,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Homebuilders increased their use of incentives again in August, which may support sales and prevent a steep fall in single-family starts.""

Permits for future construction of single-family homes rose 0.6% in July to a rate of 930,000 units. They have now increased for six straight months and were lifted by rises in the Midwest and South. Single-family building permits, however, tumbled in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West.

Permits for housing projects with five units or more fell 0.2% to a rate of 464,000 units, the lowest level since October 2020. Overall building permits edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.442 million units last month.

Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

TIGHT SUPPLY

Despite the rise in starts, housing supply is likely to remain tight. The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started fell 0.4% to 277,000 units in July.

The single-family homebuilding backlog dropped 0.7% to 140,000 units, while the completions rate for this segment increased 1.3% a rate of 1.018 million units. Overall housing completions dropped 11.8% to a rate of 1.321 million units.

The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 0.7% to a rate of 678,000 units.

The stock of multi-family housing under construction increased 1.1% to 986,000 units, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1970.

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

There was encouraging news on the industrial side of the economy, which has been bruised by the U.S. central bank's rate hikes. Output at factories rebounded 0.5% in July after declining 0.5% in June, the Fed said in a separate report.

The rebound was driven by a 5.2% acceleration in motor vehicle and parts production. But this partly reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. Production typically falls in July when automakers idle plants for retooling. However, the temporary plant closures do not always happen, which could throw off the model that the Fed uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.

Output at mines rose. Utilities production soared 5.4% after three straight monthly declines as a heat-wave across many parts of the country increased demand for air conditioning.

As a result, industrial production shot up 1.0% after dropping 0.8% in June.

""We don't think these strong July increases are fully representative of the underlying trends, because it looks like temporary factors helped boost the July readings,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

Nevertheless, the rise in industrial output bodes well for third-quarter gross domestic product. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised their third-quarter GDP tracking estimate by 0.2 percentage point to a 2.4% annualized rate, citing the strong increases in motor vehicles and utilities production.

The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the second quarter.

Summary Economy hit by dollar shortage, inflation

Officials blame crisis on external shocks

Presidential elections expected by early 2024

CAIRO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - For Egyptians grown used to a decade of reliable power supplies and boasts of vast investments in generation, a wave of rolling blackouts came as a shock - shaking faith in President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's record months before an election.

Along with record inflation and a sharp weakening of the currency, the outages have become a potent symptom of the worst economic crisis to hit Egypt since Sisi took power in 2014 on promises of stability and development.

A former army chief who has overseen a far-reaching crackdown on political dissent, Sisi is widely expected to secure a third term in elections due by early 2024, with the military and other security services in support.

But the country's economic troubles have stirred grumbling among many Egyptians, who are seeing their living standards slide even as the state has spent heavily on mega projects.

""We forgot what a power cut was,"" said Karim Mahrous, a resident of Al-Asmarat, a Cairo neighbourhood of social housing developed under Sisi where people said the power was being cut for an hour at a time.

""When electricity goes off once or twice a day and other places do not even have power cuts that last a quarter of an hour, this is called injustice.""

Power cuts have not been a significant problem since the turmoil that followed the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's 2011 uprising.

At that time, frequent outages helped turn opinion against Egypt's first democratically elected leader, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, before Sisi led his ouster in July 2013.

ECHOES OF THE PAST

Sisi's critics see echoes of that time in the power cuts that began in July and have been implemented according to a published schedule since the start of August. Residents say they have hit some areas harder than others, fuelling a sense of inequality.

""Power cuts are an indication of failure in economic policies and in management,"" said Gameela Ismail, head of Al-Dostour party, one of several marginalized opposition groups trying to press for economic and political change.

""There is a big feeling of danger, because social stability and security are threatened,"" she said.

After 2014 Sisi moved swiftly to create a surplus of power generation capacity, building three giant gas-fired plants as his government leant heavily on heavy financial support from Gulf states and Western-based international lenders.

The government says the load shedding was required because of a surge in electricity consumption for air conditioning during unusually hot weather.

Officials say that alongside hospitals and strategic buildings, areas including the north coast and the Red Sea have been exempted to protect the tourism sector, a key source of foreign currency, which Egypt desperately needs after a chronic dollar shortage was exposed early last year.

Analysts say the electricity cuts are also caused by a dip in Egypt's production of natural gas, which powers most of Egypt's grid, and is another important earner of hard currency.

The government, which has denied that gas shortages triggered the power cuts, started urging people to limit electricity consumption last summer, as it sought to save gas for export while global energy prices were high.

EXTERNAL SHOCKS

Ever since, it has been scrambling to raise dollars through multiple schemes, including from Aug. 14 giving Egyptians abroad one month to deposit money in an Abu Dhabi bank account to gain exemption from military service.

Sisi has blamed current economic problems largely on external shocks including the coronavirus pandemic and the knock-on effects of the war in Ukraine.

""Yes, the Egyptian economy suffers from crises and problems which impacted citizens and their livelihoods, but who doesn't?"" pro-Sisi member of parliament Mostafa Bakry said in an interview.

""We can solve these crises gradually and the Egyptian people can bear the burden.""

Public spending on construction has helped keep the economy in growth and led to a rapid expansion of the road network, but economists say the military's dominant role has stifled reform and the growing debt burden is a cause for concern.

Mega projects like a new capital outside Cairo and summer capital at El Alamein on the breezy north coast, where the elite traditionally spend the hottest months of the year, have also triggered popular ire.

Meanwhile, many Egyptians complain that life has become tougher due to subsidy reforms, taxes and soaring prices.

""Things were much better in the past - there is a huge difference,"" said Mohamed Ibrahim, a civil servant living in Al-Asmarat, lamenting a sharp rise in the cost of cigarettes since Mubarak's time.

US asks Iran to stop selling drones to Russia-FT,"[1/2] An image shows Iranian drone transfer to Russia, as evidence of new Russian-Iran cooperation, in this handout acquired June 9, 2023. White House/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. is pushing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia as part of discussions on a broader unwritten understanding between Washington and Tehran to de-escalate tensions, the Financial Times said on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter.

The U.S. is pressing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia, which Moscow is using in the war in Ukraine, as well as spare parts for the unmanned aircraft, the report said, citing an Iranian official and another person familiar with the talks.

The White House and Iran's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The news comes as Washington and Iran are trying to ease tensions and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that he would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

These discussions have taken place alongside the negotiations on a prisoner exchange deal last week, the newspaper said. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from Tehran's Evin prison while a fifth was already under home confinement.

Last week, sources told Reuters that Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea.

Chinese duties on U.S. imports 'inconsistent' with WTO obligations,"A logo is seen at the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters before a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, October 5, 2022. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

GENEVA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel on Wednesday found that China had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations by imposing additional duties on certain U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.

The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it was pleased with the WTO decision, adding that China had ""illegally retaliated with sham 'safeguard' tariffs.""

China's Commerce Ministry said it had noted the WTO panel decision and demanded that the United States immediately lift tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium imports.

The U.S. imposed a 25% duty on steel imports and a 10% duty on aluminium imports in March 2018 based on the Donald Trump administration's ""Section 232"" national security investigation into steel and aluminium imports.

The panel recommended that China bring its ""WTO-inconsistent measures into conformity"".

Beijing could appeal the ruling, which would send it into a legal void because Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, rendering it incapable of giving a judgment.

The WTO ruled last year that the U.S. move had also violated international trade rules, with Washington also appealing the decision.

In response to the U.S. duties, China announced that additional duties of between 15% and 25% would apply to certain imports originating in the United States, a measure challenged by Washington.

The United States agreed to remove tariffs on EU imports in 2021 but President Joe Biden's administration has otherwise kept in place the metals tariffs that were one of the centrepieces of Trump's America First strategy.

Europe space chief warns over political wavering on climate,"A satellite image, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission, shows a wildfire that broke out on August 5 south of Odemira in the Alentejo region in southern Portugal, as seen on August 7, 2023. The European Space Agency /Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

PARIS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Europe's top space official has urged wavering politicians not to abandon European leadership in combating climate change, saying record heatwaves and vegetation fires provide ""really alarming"" evidence of the pace of global warming.

""It is clear that climate change is very visible and is really causing enormous changes to our planet,"" Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency and a leading expert on environmental observation, told Reuters.

Greece, Italy, Spain and most recently Portugal have grappled with record-breaking temperatures and wildfires this summer.

The World Meterological Organization said July had the highest global average temperature for any month on record.

""This is really alarming,"" Aschbacher said. ""It just confirms that climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, to humankind, and will remain so for the next decades and we do need to do everything we can to mitigate the effects.""

Until 2021, when he stepped up to run the 22-nation agency, Aschbacher ran ESA's flagship Earth observation satellite activities including Copernicus, which the Paris-based agency says is the world's largest environmental monitoring effort.

ESA last week released a Copernicus image of a wildfire that razed thousands of hectares of forest in southern Portugal - a blaze that has since been brought under control.

Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves more frequent, intense and likely to happen across seasons, not just in what were regarded as the summer months.

But pressure is growing on some governments over the cost of net-zero commitments on emissions, and analysts say looming elections in Europe could put future measures at risk.

In Britain, where general elections are scheduled within 18 months, Prime Mininster Rishi Sunak has warned of climate policies that ""unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs"".

Ashbacher said long-term costs were likely to be far higher unless governments respond to ""crystal clear"" evidence, including satellite measurements, of the recent heat emergency in southern Europe.

""Acting now is much cheaper than waiting for years and then patching up the damage that has been caused,"" he said when asked if he saw any signs of drift in Europe's climate agenda.

""So yes, the alarm bells should still be ringing very loud. And it is certainly concerning if the signals are not heard in politics as they should be heard, in order to really save our planet."" He did not single out specific politicians or states.

FUNDING GAP AND 'GLOBAL BOILING'

Aschbacher is among the most senior climate-monitoring officials to voice concerns over wavering support for measures to combat climate change - a creeping negative reaction that some climate activists have labelled ""greenlash"".

After scientists declared July the world's hottest month on record, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said ""the era of global boiling has arrived"".

ESA's Copernicus programme involves six families of Sentinel satellites designed to read the planet's ""vital signs"" from carbon dioxide to wave height or land and ocean temperatures.

Plans for six more ""Sentinel Expansion"" missions starting from 2026 are in flux because of a funding gap of 721 million euros ($787.84 million), stemming mainly from the partial loss of UK contributions following its exit from the European Union.

Negotiations have been under way for months between Britain and the European Commission over whether and to what extent Britain should continue to contribute funds to Copernicus via the EU, which co-leads the satellite programme alongside ESA.

Canada's Northwest Territories declares emergency due to wildfires,"Companies City of Yellowknife Follow

OTTAWA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The government of Canada's Northwest Territories declared a state of emergency on Tuesday due to wildfires that have largely destroyed one remote community and are also posing a risk to territorial capital Yellowknife.

The declaration gives authorities additional powers to respond to an emergency, and underscores the unparalleled damage wrought by blazes so far this year.

""This allows the (government) to acquire and deploy the necessary resources to support the management of this unprecedented wildfire season, and protect the health and safety of Northwest Territories residents,"" the territorial government said in a statement.

The Canadian government said on Tuesday it approved federal assistance to combat the wildfires, and deployed armed forces to help with firefighting efforts in the area.

“We are working closely with the Government of the Northwest Territories to ensure communities have the support they need,"" Canadian federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said in a statement.

The city of Yellowknife also declared a state of local emergency late on Monday to brace for potential risks from nearby wildfires. The declaration was made as a precaution and residents have not been put on an evacuation notice, city officials said in a statement.

""Residents should remain calm and ensure they are prepared in the event that the situation changes,"" said Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty.

Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and sits 450 km (280 miles) south of the Arctic Circle. With about 20,000 residents, it is one of the largest settlements in the sparsely populated north.

Over the weekend, residents of most communities in the South Slave region of the Northwest Territories, situated along the Alberta border, were ordered to evacuate.

The hamlet of Enterprise, a settlement of just over 100 people, was almost completely destroyed by fire, CBC News reported on Tuesday, quoting Enterprise's mayor.

Wildfires have engulfed parts of nearly all 13 Canadian provinces and territories this year, forcing home evacuations, disrupting energy production, and drawing in federal as well as international firefighting resources.

More than 130,000 square kilometers of land have been scorched, the most on record for this stage in the season, and nearly 168,000 people have been forced to evacuate at some point.

Northwest Territories has so far had 265 wildfires this year, much higher than its 10-year annual average of 185.

TIGHT SUPPLY

Despite the rise in starts, housing supply is likely to remain tight. The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started fell 0.4% to 277,000 units in July.

The single-family homebuilding backlog dropped 0.7% to 140,000 units, while the completions rate for this segment increased 1.3% a rate of 1.018 million units. Overall housing completions dropped 11.8% to a rate of 1.321 million units.

The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 0.7% to a rate of 678,000 units.

The stock of multi-family housing under construction increased 1.1% to 986,000 units, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1970.

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

There was encouraging news on the industrial side of the economy, which has been bruised by the U.S. central bank's rate hikes. Output at factories rebounded 0.5% in July after declining 0.5% in June, the Fed said in a separate report.

The rebound was driven by a 5.2% acceleration in motor vehicle and parts production. But this partly reflected difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. Production typically falls in July when automakers idle plants for retooling. However, the temporary plant closures do not always happen, which could throw off the model that the Fed uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.

Output at mines rose. Utilities production soared 5.4% after three straight monthly declines as a heat-wave across many parts of the country increased demand for air conditioning.

As a result, industrial production shot up 1.0% after dropping 0.8% in June.

""We don't think these strong July increases are fully representative of the underlying trends, because it looks like temporary factors helped boost the July readings,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

Nevertheless, the rise in industrial output bodes well for third-quarter gross domestic product. Economists at Goldman Sachs raised their third-quarter GDP tracking estimate by 0.2 percentage point to a 2.4% annualized rate, citing the strong increases in motor vehicles and utilities production.

The economy grew at a 2.4% pace in the second quarter.

Summary Economy hit by dollar shortage, inflation

Officials blame crisis on external shocks

Presidential elections expected by early 2024

CAIRO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - For Egyptians grown used to a decade of reliable power supplies and boasts of vast investments in generation, a wave of rolling blackouts came as a shock - shaking faith in President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's record months before an election.

Along with record inflation and a sharp weakening of the currency, the outages have become a potent symptom of the worst economic crisis to hit Egypt since Sisi took power in 2014 on promises of stability and development.

A former army chief who has overseen a far-reaching crackdown on political dissent, Sisi is widely expected to secure a third term in elections due by early 2024, with the military and other security services in support.

But the country's economic troubles have stirred grumbling among many Egyptians, who are seeing their living standards slide even as the state has spent heavily on mega projects.

""We forgot what a power cut was,"" said Karim Mahrous, a resident of Al-Asmarat, a Cairo neighbourhood of social housing developed under Sisi where people said the power was being cut for an hour at a time.

""When electricity goes off once or twice a day and other places do not even have power cuts that last a quarter of an hour, this is called injustice.""

Power cuts have not been a significant problem since the turmoil that followed the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's 2011 uprising.

At that time, frequent outages helped turn opinion against Egypt's first democratically elected leader, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, before Sisi led his ouster in July 2013.

ECHOES OF THE PAST

Sisi's critics see echoes of that time in the power cuts that began in July and have been implemented according to a published schedule since the start of August. Residents say they have hit some areas harder than others, fuelling a sense of inequality.

""Power cuts are an indication of failure in economic policies and in management,"" said Gameela Ismail, head of Al-Dostour party, one of several marginalized opposition groups trying to press for economic and political change.

""There is a big feeling of danger, because social stability and security are threatened,"" she said.

After 2014 Sisi moved swiftly to create a surplus of power generation capacity, building three giant gas-fired plants as his government leant heavily on heavy financial support from Gulf states and Western-based international lenders.

The government says the load shedding was required because of a surge in electricity consumption for air conditioning during unusually hot weather.

Officials say that alongside hospitals and strategic buildings, areas including the north coast and the Red Sea have been exempted to protect the tourism sector, a key source of foreign currency, which Egypt desperately needs after a chronic dollar shortage was exposed early last year.

Analysts say the electricity cuts are also caused by a dip in Egypt's production of natural gas, which powers most of Egypt's grid, and is another important earner of hard currency.

The government, which has denied that gas shortages triggered the power cuts, started urging people to limit electricity consumption last summer, as it sought to save gas for export while global energy prices were high.

EXTERNAL SHOCKS

Ever since, it has been scrambling to raise dollars through multiple schemes, including from Aug. 14 giving Egyptians abroad one month to deposit money in an Abu Dhabi bank account to gain exemption from military service.

Sisi has blamed current economic problems largely on external shocks including the coronavirus pandemic and the knock-on effects of the war in Ukraine.

""Yes, the Egyptian economy suffers from crises and problems which impacted citizens and their livelihoods, but who doesn't?"" pro-Sisi member of parliament Mostafa Bakry said in an interview.

""We can solve these crises gradually and the Egyptian people can bear the burden.""

Public spending on construction has helped keep the economy in growth and led to a rapid expansion of the road network, but economists say the military's dominant role has stifled reform and the growing debt burden is a cause for concern.

Mega projects like a new capital outside Cairo and summer capital at El Alamein on the breezy north coast, where the elite traditionally spend the hottest months of the year, have also triggered popular ire.

Meanwhile, many Egyptians complain that life has become tougher due to subsidy reforms, taxes and soaring prices.

""Things were much better in the past - there is a huge difference,"" said Mohamed Ibrahim, a civil servant living in Al-Asmarat, lamenting a sharp rise in the cost of cigarettes since Mubarak's time.

US asks Iran to stop selling drones to Russia-FT,"[1/2] An image shows Iranian drone transfer to Russia, as evidence of new Russian-Iran cooperation, in this handout acquired June 9, 2023. White House/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. is pushing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia as part of discussions on a broader unwritten understanding between Washington and Tehran to de-escalate tensions, the Financial Times said on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter.

The U.S. is pressing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia, which Moscow is using in the war in Ukraine, as well as spare parts for the unmanned aircraft, the report said, citing an Iranian official and another person familiar with the talks.

The White House and Iran's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The news comes as Washington and Iran are trying to ease tensions and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that he would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

These discussions have taken place alongside the negotiations on a prisoner exchange deal last week, the newspaper said. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from Tehran's Evin prison while a fifth was already under home confinement.

Last week, sources told Reuters that Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea.

Chinese duties on U.S. imports 'inconsistent' with WTO obligations,"A logo is seen at the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters before a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, October 5, 2022. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

GENEVA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel on Wednesday found that China had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations by imposing additional duties on certain U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.

The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it was pleased with the WTO decision, adding that China had ""illegally retaliated with sham 'safeguard' tariffs.""

China's Commerce Ministry said it had noted the WTO panel decision and demanded that the United States immediately lift tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium imports.

The U.S. imposed a 25% duty on steel imports and a 10% duty on aluminium imports in March 2018 based on the Donald Trump administration's ""Section 232"" national security investigation into steel and aluminium imports.

The panel recommended that China bring its ""WTO-inconsistent measures into conformity"".

Beijing could appeal the ruling, which would send it into a legal void because Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, rendering it incapable of giving a judgment.

The WTO ruled last year that the U.S. move had also violated international trade rules, with Washington also appealing the decision.

In response to the U.S. duties, China announced that additional duties of between 15% and 25% would apply to certain imports originating in the United States, a measure challenged by Washington.

The United States agreed to remove tariffs on EU imports in 2021 but President Joe Biden's administration has otherwise kept in place the metals tariffs that were one of the centrepieces of Trump's America First strategy.

Europe space chief warns over political wavering on climate,"A satellite image, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission, shows a wildfire that broke out on August 5 south of Odemira in the Alentejo region in southern Portugal, as seen on August 7, 2023. The European Space Agency /Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

PARIS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Europe's top space official has urged wavering politicians not to abandon European leadership in combating climate change, saying record heatwaves and vegetation fires provide ""really alarming"" evidence of the pace of global warming.

""It is clear that climate change is very visible and is really causing enormous changes to our planet,"" Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency and a leading expert on environmental observation, told Reuters.

Greece, Italy, Spain and most recently Portugal have grappled with record-breaking temperatures and wildfires this summer.

The World Meterological Organization said July had the highest global average temperature for any month on record.

""This is really alarming,"" Aschbacher said. ""It just confirms that climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, to humankind, and will remain so for the next decades and we do need to do everything we can to mitigate the effects.""

Until 2021, when he stepped up to run the 22-nation agency, Aschbacher ran ESA's flagship Earth observation satellite activities including Copernicus, which the Paris-based agency says is the world's largest environmental monitoring effort.

ESA last week released a Copernicus image of a wildfire that razed thousands of hectares of forest in southern Portugal - a blaze that has since been brought under control.

Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves more frequent, intense and likely to happen across seasons, not just in what were regarded as the summer months.

But pressure is growing on some governments over the cost of net-zero commitments on emissions, and analysts say looming elections in Europe could put future measures at risk.

In Britain, where general elections are scheduled within 18 months, Prime Mininster Rishi Sunak has warned of climate policies that ""unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs"".

Ashbacher said long-term costs were likely to be far higher unless governments respond to ""crystal clear"" evidence, including satellite measurements, of the recent heat emergency in southern Europe.

""Acting now is much cheaper than waiting for years and then patching up the damage that has been caused,"" he said when asked if he saw any signs of drift in Europe's climate agenda.

""So yes, the alarm bells should still be ringing very loud. And it is certainly concerning if the signals are not heard in politics as they should be heard, in order to really save our planet."" He did not single out specific politicians or states.

FUNDING GAP AND 'GLOBAL BOILING'

Aschbacher is among the most senior climate-monitoring officials to voice concerns over wavering support for measures to combat climate change - a creeping negative reaction that some climate activists have labelled ""greenlash"".

After scientists declared July the world's hottest month on record, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said ""the era of global boiling has arrived"".

ESA's Copernicus programme involves six families of Sentinel satellites designed to read the planet's ""vital signs"" from carbon dioxide to wave height or land and ocean temperatures.

Plans for six more ""Sentinel Expansion"" missions starting from 2026 are in flux because of a funding gap of 721 million euros ($787.84 million), stemming mainly from the partial loss of UK contributions following its exit from the European Union.

Negotiations have been under way for months between Britain and the European Commission over whether and to what extent Britain should continue to contribute funds to Copernicus via the EU, which co-leads the satellite programme alongside ESA.

Britain's smaller direct contribution to Copernicus as one of the core member nations of ESA itself is unaffected.

Britain's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Although it is not part of the talks, Aschbacher said ESA needs a funding decision by June 2024 ""to continue development of the next set of Sentinel satellites in an uninterrupted way"".

Failure to meet that deadline would kick the funding decision into the next planning period from 2028, Aschbacher said. Suspending work on the next round of satellites would also drive up costs by damaging continuity and send the wrong message about Europe's leadership on climate issues, he said.

""The impact would be very significant because the Sentinels are required in order to provide a number of critical climate parameters. This would significantly impact Europe’s commitment to combating climate change.""

Canada's Northwest Territories declares emergency due to wildfires,"Companies City of Yellowknife Follow

OTTAWA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The government of Canada's Northwest Territories declared a state of emergency on Tuesday due to wildfires that have largely destroyed one remote community and are also posing a risk to territorial capital Yellowknife.

The declaration gives authorities additional powers to respond to an emergency, and underscores the unparalleled damage wrought by blazes so far this year.

""This allows the (government) to acquire and deploy the necessary resources to support the management of this unprecedented wildfire season, and protect the health and safety of Northwest Territories residents,"" the territorial government said in a statement.

The Canadian government said on Tuesday it approved federal assistance to combat the wildfires, and deployed armed forces to help with firefighting efforts in the area.

“We are working closely with the Government of the Northwest Territories to ensure communities have the support they need,"" Canadian federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said in a statement.

The city of Yellowknife also declared a state of local emergency late on Monday to brace for potential risks from nearby wildfires. The declaration was made as a precaution and residents have not been put on an evacuation notice, city officials said in a statement.

""Residents should remain calm and ensure they are prepared in the event that the situation changes,"" said Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty.

Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and sits 450 km (280 miles) south of the Arctic Circle. With about 20,000 residents, it is one of the largest settlements in the sparsely populated north.

Over the weekend, residents of most communities in the South Slave region of the Northwest Territories, situated along the Alberta border, were ordered to evacuate.

The hamlet of Enterprise, a settlement of just over 100 people, was almost completely destroyed by fire, CBC News reported on Tuesday, quoting Enterprise's mayor.

Wildfires have engulfed parts of nearly all 13 Canadian provinces and territories this year, forcing home evacuations, disrupting energy production, and drawing in federal as well as international firefighting resources.

More than 130,000 square kilometers of land have been scorched, the most on record for this stage in the season, and nearly 168,000 people have been forced to evacuate at some point.

Northwest Territories has so far had 265 wildfires this year, much higher than its 10-year annual average of 185.

Summary Single-family housing starts increase 6.7% in July

Single-family building permits rise 0.6%

Overall housing starts climb 3.9%; permits gain 0.1%

Manufacturing production increases 0.5%

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding surged in July and permits for future construction rose amid an acute shortage of previously owned houses, but mortgage rates climbing back to near two-decade highs could slow the housing market improvement.

The sharp rebound in groundbreaking on single-family housing units reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was another sign of the economy continuing to defy dire forecasts of a recession. It followed news on Tuesday that retail sales rose strongly in July, which prompted economists to upgrade their growth estimates for the third quarters.

With inflation retreating, economists did not see the flow of upbeat data leading to another interest rate hike next month.

""Housing generally has shown resilience, but Fed officials may overlook this latest news of strengthening demand in the economy when it comes to judging whether to hike rates again this year because of the progress made on the inflation front,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.

Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, jumped 6.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units last month. They rose 9.5% year-on-year in July. The increase in groundbreaking was led by the West, where single-family starts soared 28.5%.

Starts rose 12.5% in the Midwest. But they fell 3.4% in the Northeast and declined 1.3% in the densely populated South.

After being pummeled by the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening, the housing market has stabilized. Further improvement, however, looks likely to be curtailed by the renewed increase in mortgage rates.

The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage has risen to 6.96% over the past weeks, according to latest data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. The rate is within striking distance of the 7.08% seen in late October and early November, which was the highest since April 2002.

Mortgage rates near 7% were attributed to the ebb in confidence among homebuilders in August, with the National Association of Home Builders saying more builders were offering incentives to attract buyers amid expectations of lower sales.

The Fed has since March 2022 raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25% to 5.50% range. Starts for housing projects with five units or more were unchanged at a rate of 460,000 units in July. Demand for rental accommodation, largely driven by higher mortgage rates sidelining some potential home buyers, is slowing. There is also a record stock of multi-family housing under construction.

Overall housing starts increased 3.9% to a rate of 1.452 million units in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.448 million units.

""The need for new single-family homes, which is driven by scarce existing home inventory, should keep a floor under single-family construction,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Homebuilders increased their use of incentives again in August, which may support sales and prevent a steep fall in single-family starts.""

Permits for future construction of single-family homes rose 0.6% in July to a rate of 930,000 units. They have now increased for six straight months and were lifted by rises in the Midwest and South. Single-family building permits, however, tumbled in the Northeast and were unchanged in the West.

Permits for housing projects with five units or more fell 0.2% to a rate of 464,000 units, the lowest level since October 2020. Overall building permits edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.442 million units last month.

Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

TIGHT SUPPLY

Despite the rise in starts, housing supply is likely to remain tight. The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started fell 0.4% to 277,000 units in July.

The single-family homebuilding backlog dropped 0.7% to 140,000 units, while the completions rate for this segment increased 1.3% a rate of 1.018 million units. Overall housing completions dropped 11.8% to a rate of 1.321 million units.

The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 0.7% to a rate of 678,000 units.

The stock of multi-family housing under construction increased 1.1% to 986,000 units, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1970.

The WTO ruled last year that the U.S. move had also violated international trade rules, with Washington also appealing the decision.

In response to the U.S. duties, China announced that additional duties of between 15% and 25% would apply to certain imports originating in the United States, a measure challenged by Washington.

The United States agreed to remove tariffs on EU imports in 2021 but President Joe Biden's administration has otherwise kept in place the metals tariffs that were one of the centrepieces of Trump's America First strategy.

Europe space chief warns over political wavering on climate,"A satellite image, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission, shows a wildfire that broke out on August 5 south of Odemira in the Alentejo region in southern Portugal, as seen on August 7, 2023. The European Space Agency /Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

PARIS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Europe's top space official has urged wavering politicians not to abandon European leadership in combating climate change, saying record heatwaves and vegetation fires provide ""really alarming"" evidence of the pace of global warming.

""It is clear that climate change is very visible and is really causing enormous changes to our planet,"" Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency and a leading expert on environmental observation, told Reuters.

Greece, Italy, Spain and most recently Portugal have grappled with record-breaking temperatures and wildfires this summer.

The World Meterological Organization said July had the highest global average temperature for any month on record.

""This is really alarming,"" Aschbacher said. ""It just confirms that climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, to humankind, and will remain so for the next decades and we do need to do everything we can to mitigate the effects.""

Until 2021, when he stepped up to run the 22-nation agency, Aschbacher ran ESA's flagship Earth observation satellite activities including Copernicus, which the Paris-based agency says is the world's largest environmental monitoring effort.

ESA last week released a Copernicus image of a wildfire that razed thousands of hectares of forest in southern Portugal - a blaze that has since been brought under control.

Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves more frequent, intense and likely to happen across seasons, not just in what were regarded as the summer months.

But pressure is growing on some governments over the cost of net-zero commitments on emissions, and analysts say looming elections in Europe could put future measures at risk.

In Britain, where general elections are scheduled within 18 months, Prime Mininster Rishi Sunak has warned of climate policies that ""unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs"".

Ashbacher said long-term costs were likely to be far higher unless governments respond to ""crystal clear"" evidence, including satellite measurements, of the recent heat emergency in southern Europe.

""Acting now is much cheaper than waiting for years and then patching up the damage that has been caused,"" he said when asked if he saw any signs of drift in Europe's climate agenda.

""So yes, the alarm bells should still be ringing very loud. And it is certainly concerning if the signals are not heard in politics as they should be heard, in order to really save our planet."" He did not single out specific politicians or states.

FUNDING GAP AND 'GLOBAL BOILING'

Aschbacher is among the most senior climate-monitoring officials to voice concerns over wavering support for measures to combat climate change - a creeping negative reaction that some climate activists have labelled ""greenlash"".

After scientists declared July the world's hottest month on record, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said ""the era of global boiling has arrived"".

ESA's Copernicus programme involves six families of Sentinel satellites designed to read the planet's ""vital signs"" from carbon dioxide to wave height or land and ocean temperatures.

Plans for six more ""Sentinel Expansion"" missions starting from 2026 are in flux because of a funding gap of 721 million euros ($787.84 million), stemming mainly from the partial loss of UK contributions following its exit from the European Union.

Negotiations have been under way for months between Britain and the European Commission over whether and to what extent Britain should continue to contribute funds to Copernicus via the EU, which co-leads the satellite programme alongside ESA.

Britain's smaller direct contribution to Copernicus as one of the core member nations of ESA itself is unaffected.

Britain's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Although it is not part of the talks, Aschbacher said ESA needs a funding decision by June 2024 ""to continue development of the next set of Sentinel satellites in an uninterrupted way"".

Failure to meet that deadline would kick the funding decision into the next planning period from 2028, Aschbacher said. Suspending work on the next round of satellites would also drive up costs by damaging continuity and send the wrong message about Europe's leadership on climate issues, he said.

""The impact would be very significant because the Sentinels are required in order to provide a number of critical climate parameters. This would significantly impact Europe’s commitment to combating climate change.""

Canada's Northwest Territories declares emergency due to wildfires,"Companies City of Yellowknife Follow

OTTAWA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The government of Canada's Northwest Territories declared a state of emergency on Tuesday due to wildfires that have largely destroyed one remote community and are also posing a risk to territorial capital Yellowknife.

The declaration gives authorities additional powers to respond to an emergency, and underscores the unparalleled damage wrought by blazes so far this year.

""This allows the (government) to acquire and deploy the necessary resources to support the management of this unprecedented wildfire season, and protect the health and safety of Northwest Territories residents,"" the territorial government said in a statement.

The Canadian government said on Tuesday it approved federal assistance to combat the wildfires, and deployed armed forces to help with firefighting efforts in the area.

“We are working closely with the Government of the Northwest Territories to ensure communities have the support they need,"" Canadian federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said in a statement.

The city of Yellowknife also declared a state of local emergency late on Monday to brace for potential risks from nearby wildfires. The declaration was made as a precaution and residents have not been put on an evacuation notice, city officials said in a statement.

""Residents should remain calm and ensure they are prepared in the event that the situation changes,"" said Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty.

Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and sits 450 km (280 miles) south of the Arctic Circle. With about 20,000 residents, it is one of the largest settlements in the sparsely populated north.

Over the weekend, residents of most communities in the South Slave region of the Northwest Territories, situated along the Alberta border, were ordered to evacuate.

The hamlet of Enterprise, a settlement of just over 100 people, was almost completely destroyed by fire, CBC News reported on Tuesday, quoting Enterprise's mayor.

Wildfires have engulfed parts of nearly all 13 Canadian provinces and territories this year, forcing home evacuations, disrupting energy production, and drawing in federal as well as international firefighting resources.

More than 130,000 square kilometers of land have been scorched, the most on record for this stage in the season, and nearly 168,000 people have been forced to evacuate at some point.

Northwest Territories has so far had 265 wildfires this year, much higher than its 10-year annual average of 185.

The man was arrested in October last year after he entered the National Bank with fake documents, claiming to be a representative from an investment company.

""The investigation has indicated that there were attempts of serious fraud and particularly severe document forgery, which the court agreed with,"" Magnus Petersen, assistant prosecutor from the Danish prosecution authority, said in a statement.

The man, who wasn't named, has been held in custody since his arrest last year. He will not appeal the sentence.

He will serve his time in Denmark, after which he will be deported and banned from returning to the country.

"Americans back tariffs, military prep against China -Reuters/Ipsos poll","A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Bipartisan majorities of Americans favor more tariffs on Chinese goods and believe that the United States needs to step up preparations for military threats from the country, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos survey.

The two-day poll, which concluded on Tuesday, revealed deep worries among Americans about China's global influence at a time when U.S.-China relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades.

Some 66% of respondents said they were more likely to back a candidate in the 2024 presidential election who ""supports additional tariffs on Chinese imports.""

Another 66% of respondents - including 58% of Democrats and 81% of Republicans - agreed with a statement that the United States ""needs to do more to prepare for military threats from China.""

Still, just 38% of Americans supported the possible deployment of U.S. troops to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, showing the political constraints facing any president seeking U.S. military involvement in a conflict involving China.

The bipartisan concern about China helps explain the increasingly combative stances Republican presidential candidates have taken toward the world's second-largest economy.

In recent months, Republican White House hopefuls have attacked China daily, with each candidate trying to show voters that they are best positioned to take on America's geopolitical foe.

Former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have all called for the United States to end permanent normal trade relations with China, which would limit economic ties between the countries.

Biden has sought to stabilize the intense U.S.-China rivalry through high-level official engagement. But at recent fundraising events the president has called its economy a ""ticking time bomb"" and referred to its leader Xi Jinping a dictator.

DEFENDING TAIWAN?

The online Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted nationwide, collecting responses from 1,005 adults, including 443 Democrats and 346 Republicans. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points in either direction.

Seventy-five percent of Americans had a negative view toward China, while 84% saw Xi at least slightly unfavorably. Some 65% felt China's government was trying to influence the U.S. election.

While half of respondents supported aiding Taiwan with military equipment to deter a possible Chinese attack, 42% opposed deploying U.S. troops in Taiwan's defense, and 20% said they didn't know.

Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by China as its territory, is the main flashpoint in U.S. ties with China's Communist government.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns has said that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of Taiwan by 2027, though that does not necessarily mean he will go ahead with it.

Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule.

Biden said in 2022 that U.S forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, appearing to go beyond the long-standing U.S. approach of ""strategic ambiguity"" - not making clear whether it would respond militarily to such an attack.

But his administration has routinely said there has been no change to U.S. policy toward Taiwan.

Summary Economy hit by dollar shortage, inflation

Officials blame crisis on external shocks

Presidential elections expected by early 2024

CAIRO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - For Egyptians grown used to a decade of reliable power supplies and boasts of vast investments in generation, a wave of rolling blackouts came as a shock - shaking faith in President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's record months before an election.

Along with record inflation and a sharp weakening of the currency, the outages have become a potent symptom of the worst economic crisis to hit Egypt since Sisi took power in 2014 on promises of stability and development.

A former army chief who has overseen a far-reaching crackdown on political dissent, Sisi is widely expected to secure a third term in elections due by early 2024, with the military and other security services in support.

But the country's economic troubles have stirred grumbling among many Egyptians, who are seeing their living standards slide even as the state has spent heavily on mega projects.

""We forgot what a power cut was,"" said Karim Mahrous, a resident of Al-Asmarat, a Cairo neighbourhood of social housing developed under Sisi where people said the power was being cut for an hour at a time.

""When electricity goes off once or twice a day and other places do not even have power cuts that last a quarter of an hour, this is called injustice.""

Power cuts have not been a significant problem since the turmoil that followed the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's 2011 uprising.

At that time, frequent outages helped turn opinion against Egypt's first democratically elected leader, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, before Sisi led his ouster in July 2013.

ECHOES OF THE PAST

Sisi's critics see echoes of that time in the power cuts that began in July and have been implemented according to a published schedule since the start of August. Residents say they have hit some areas harder than others, fuelling a sense of inequality.

""Power cuts are an indication of failure in economic policies and in management,"" said Gameela Ismail, head of Al-Dostour party, one of several marginalized opposition groups trying to press for economic and political change.

""There is a big feeling of danger, because social stability and security are threatened,"" she said.

After 2014 Sisi moved swiftly to create a surplus of power generation capacity, building three giant gas-fired plants as his government leant heavily on heavy financial support from Gulf states and Western-based international lenders.

The government says the load shedding was required because of a surge in electricity consumption for air conditioning during unusually hot weather.

Officials say that alongside hospitals and strategic buildings, areas including the north coast and the Red Sea have been exempted to protect the tourism sector, a key source of foreign currency, which Egypt desperately needs after a chronic dollar shortage was exposed early last year.

Analysts say the electricity cuts are also caused by a dip in Egypt's production of natural gas, which powers most of Egypt's grid, and is another important earner of hard currency.

The government, which has denied that gas shortages triggered the power cuts, started urging people to limit electricity consumption last summer, as it sought to save gas for export while global energy prices were high.

EXTERNAL SHOCKS

Ever since, it has been scrambling to raise dollars through multiple schemes, including from Aug. 14 giving Egyptians abroad one month to deposit money in an Abu Dhabi bank account to gain exemption from military service.

Sisi has blamed current economic problems largely on external shocks including the coronavirus pandemic and the knock-on effects of the war in Ukraine.

""Yes, the Egyptian economy suffers from crises and problems which impacted citizens and their livelihoods, but who doesn't?"" pro-Sisi member of parliament Mostafa Bakry said in an interview.

""We can solve these crises gradually and the Egyptian people can bear the burden.""

Public spending on construction has helped keep the economy in growth and led to a rapid expansion of the road network, but economists say the military's dominant role has stifled reform and the growing debt burden is a cause for concern.

Mega projects like a new capital outside Cairo and summer capital at El Alamein on the breezy north coast, where the elite traditionally spend the hottest months of the year, have also triggered popular ire.

Meanwhile, many Egyptians complain that life has become tougher due to subsidy reforms, taxes and soaring prices.

""Things were much better in the past - there is a huge difference,"" said Mohamed Ibrahim, a civil servant living in Al-Asmarat, lamenting a sharp rise in the cost of cigarettes since Mubarak's time.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. is pushing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia as part of discussions on a broader unwritten understanding between Washington and Tehran to de-escalate tensions, the Financial Times said on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter.

The U.S. is pressing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia, which Moscow is using in the war in Ukraine, as well as spare parts for the unmanned aircraft, the report said, citing an Iranian official and another person familiar with the talks.

The White House and Iran's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The news comes as Washington and Iran are trying to ease tensions and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that he would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

These discussions have taken place alongside the negotiations on a prisoner exchange deal last week, the newspaper said. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from Tehran's Evin prison while a fifth was already under home confinement.

Last week, sources told Reuters that Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea.

Chinese duties on U.S. imports 'inconsistent' with WTO obligations,"A logo is seen at the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters before a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, October 5, 2022. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

GENEVA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel on Wednesday found that China had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations by imposing additional duties on certain U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.

The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it was pleased with the WTO decision, adding that China had ""illegally retaliated with sham 'safeguard' tariffs.""

China's Commerce Ministry said it had noted the WTO panel decision and demanded that the United States immediately lift tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium imports.

The U.S. imposed a 25% duty on steel imports and a 10% duty on aluminium imports in March 2018 based on the Donald Trump administration's ""Section 232"" national security investigation into steel and aluminium imports.

The panel recommended that China bring its ""WTO-inconsistent measures into conformity"".

Beijing could appeal the ruling, which would send it into a legal void because Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, rendering it incapable of giving a judgment.

The WTO ruled last year that the U.S. move had also violated international trade rules, with Washington also appealing the decision.

In response to the U.S. duties, China announced that additional duties of between 15% and 25% would apply to certain imports originating in the United States, a measure challenged by Washington.

HYDERABAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India's Amara Raja Batteries (AMAR.NS) plans to expand into the two-wheeler electric vehicle (EV) market, first through chargers and then batteries, as part of an expansion to triple its lithium-ion business this financial year, a top executive said.

Amara Raja, which currently has customers only in the three-wheeler EV market, gets about 2.5% of its revenue from its lithium-ion battery business, while the rest of its total revenue of 103.85 billion rupees ($1.25 billion) in fiscal 2023 was from its flagship lead acid storage battery-making unit.

The company, which owns the Amaron battery brand, aims to penetrate into two-wheeler EV market first with chargers and eventually through battery packs as it expands its so-called 'new energy' segment.

""This year, we're looking to grow very aggressively, that is almost going to be three times of last year,"" Executive Director Vikramadithya Gourineni said in an interview with Reuters last week.

It is also banking on its upcoming lithium cell and battery pack manufacturing units, one of India's largest, to increase production by the first quarter of the next financial year.

""We're talking to people for cell technology, chemistry development; we're even working with Indian players for raw materials,"" he said, highlighting how demand from the telecom sector is growing.

Amara Raja is also in talks with global companies to explore opportunities for ""technology transfer"" tied to lithium-ion battery manufacturing, sources told Reuters. However, Gourineni declined to provide more details.

The company has customers across the automotive, telecom and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) sectors.

Its lead acid battery arm will focus on expanding in the West and the company is in talks with eight ""large"" distributors in North America for a strategic supply partnership, Executive Director Harshavardhana Gourineni said.

""These distributors have their own brands and we're looking to offer our products. Some of these partnerships will materialise in this financial year,"" he said.

US asks Iran to stop selling drones to Russia-FT,"[1/2] An image shows Iranian drone transfer to Russia, as evidence of new Russian-Iran cooperation, in this handout acquired June 9, 2023. White House/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. is pushing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia as part of discussions on a broader unwritten understanding between Washington and Tehran to de-escalate tensions, the Financial Times said on Wednesday, citing people briefed on the matter.

The U.S. is pressing Iran to stop selling armed drones to Russia, which Moscow is using in the war in Ukraine, as well as spare parts for the unmanned aircraft, the report said, citing an Iranian official and another person familiar with the talks.

The White House and Iran's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The news comes as Washington and Iran are trying to ease tensions and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that he would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

These discussions have taken place alongside the negotiations on a prisoner exchange deal last week, the newspaper said. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from Tehran's Evin prison while a fifth was already under home confinement.

Last week, sources told Reuters that Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea.

Chinese duties on U.S. imports 'inconsistent' with WTO obligations,"A logo is seen at the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters before a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland, October 5, 2022. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

GENEVA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel on Wednesday found that China had acted inconsistently with its WTO obligations by imposing additional duties on certain U.S. imports in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium.

The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it was pleased with the WTO decision, adding that China had ""illegally retaliated with sham 'safeguard' tariffs.""

China's Commerce Ministry said it had noted the WTO panel decision and demanded that the United States immediately lift tariffs imposed on steel and aluminium imports.

The U.S. imposed a 25% duty on steel imports and a 10% duty on aluminium imports in March 2018 based on the Donald Trump administration's ""Section 232"" national security investigation into steel and aluminium imports.

The panel recommended that China bring its ""WTO-inconsistent measures into conformity"".

Beijing could appeal the ruling, which would send it into a legal void because Washington has blocked appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, rendering it incapable of giving a judgment.

The WTO ruled last year that the U.S. move had also violated international trade rules, with Washington also appealing the decision.

In response to the U.S. duties, China announced that additional duties of between 15% and 25% would apply to certain imports originating in the United States, a measure challenged by Washington.

The United States agreed to remove tariffs on EU imports in 2021 but President Joe Biden's administration has otherwise kept in place the metals tariffs that were one of the centrepieces of Trump's America First strategy.

Europe space chief warns over political wavering on climate,"A satellite image, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission, shows a wildfire that broke out on August 5 south of Odemira in the Alentejo region in southern Portugal, as seen on August 7, 2023. The European Space Agency /Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

PARIS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Europe's top space official has urged wavering politicians not to abandon European leadership in combating climate change, saying record heatwaves and vegetation fires provide ""really alarming"" evidence of the pace of global warming.

""It is clear that climate change is very visible and is really causing enormous changes to our planet,"" Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency and a leading expert on environmental observation, told Reuters.

Greece, Italy, Spain and most recently Portugal have grappled with record-breaking temperatures and wildfires this summer.

The World Meterological Organization said July had the highest global average temperature for any month on record.

""This is really alarming,"" Aschbacher said. ""It just confirms that climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, to humankind, and will remain so for the next decades and we do need to do everything we can to mitigate the effects.""

Until 2021, when he stepped up to run the 22-nation agency, Aschbacher ran ESA's flagship Earth observation satellite activities including Copernicus, which the Paris-based agency says is the world's largest environmental monitoring effort.

ESA last week released a Copernicus image of a wildfire that razed thousands of hectares of forest in southern Portugal - a blaze that has since been brought under control.

Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves more frequent, intense and likely to happen across seasons, not just in what were regarded as the summer months.

But pressure is growing on some governments over the cost of net-zero commitments on emissions, and analysts say looming elections in Europe could put future measures at risk.

In Britain, where general elections are scheduled within 18 months, Prime Mininster Rishi Sunak has warned of climate policies that ""unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs"".

Ashbacher said long-term costs were likely to be far higher unless governments respond to ""crystal clear"" evidence, including satellite measurements, of the recent heat emergency in southern Europe.

""Acting now is much cheaper than waiting for years and then patching up the damage that has been caused,"" he said when asked if he saw any signs of drift in Europe's climate agenda.

""So yes, the alarm bells should still be ringing very loud. And it is certainly concerning if the signals are not heard in politics as they should be heard, in order to really save our planet."" He did not single out specific politicians or states.

FUNDING GAP AND 'GLOBAL BOILING'

Aschbacher is among the most senior climate-monitoring officials to voice concerns over wavering support for measures to combat climate change - a creeping negative reaction that some climate activists have labelled ""greenlash"".

After scientists declared July the world's hottest month on record, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said ""the era of global boiling has arrived"".

ESA's Copernicus programme involves six families of Sentinel satellites designed to read the planet's ""vital signs"" from carbon dioxide to wave height or land and ocean temperatures.

Plans for six more ""Sentinel Expansion"" missions starting from 2026 are in flux because of a funding gap of 721 million euros ($787.84 million), stemming mainly from the partial loss of UK contributions following its exit from the European Union.

Negotiations have been under way for months between Britain and the European Commission over whether and to what extent Britain should continue to contribute funds to Copernicus via the EU, which co-leads the satellite programme alongside ESA.

Britain's smaller direct contribution to Copernicus as one of the core member nations of ESA itself is unaffected.

Britain's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Although it is not part of the talks, Aschbacher said ESA needs a funding decision by June 2024 ""to continue development of the next set of Sentinel satellites in an uninterrupted way"".

Failure to meet that deadline would kick the funding decision into the next planning period from 2028, Aschbacher said. Suspending work on the next round of satellites would also drive up costs by damaging continuity and send the wrong message about Europe's leadership on climate issues, he said.

""The impact would be very significant because the Sentinels are required in order to provide a number of critical climate parameters. This would significantly impact Europe’s commitment to combating climate change.""

Canada's Northwest Territories declares emergency due to wildfires,"Companies City of Yellowknife Follow

OTTAWA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The government of Canada's Northwest Territories declared a state of emergency on Tuesday due to wildfires that have largely destroyed one remote community and are also posing a risk to territorial capital Yellowknife.

The declaration gives authorities additional powers to respond to an emergency, and underscores the unparalleled damage wrought by blazes so far this year.

""This allows the (government) to acquire and deploy the necessary resources to support the management of this unprecedented wildfire season, and protect the health and safety of Northwest Territories residents,"" the territorial government said in a statement.

The Canadian government said on Tuesday it approved federal assistance to combat the wildfires, and deployed armed forces to help with firefighting efforts in the area.

“We are working closely with the Government of the Northwest Territories to ensure communities have the support they need,"" Canadian federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said in a statement.

The city of Yellowknife also declared a state of local emergency late on Monday to brace for potential risks from nearby wildfires. The declaration was made as a precaution and residents have not been put on an evacuation notice, city officials said in a statement.

""Residents should remain calm and ensure they are prepared in the event that the situation changes,"" said Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty.

Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and sits 450 km (280 miles) south of the Arctic Circle. With about 20,000 residents, it is one of the largest settlements in the sparsely populated north.

Over the weekend, residents of most communities in the South Slave region of the Northwest Territories, situated along the Alberta border, were ordered to evacuate.

The hamlet of Enterprise, a settlement of just over 100 people, was almost completely destroyed by fire, CBC News reported on Tuesday, quoting Enterprise's mayor.

Wildfires have engulfed parts of nearly all 13 Canadian provinces and territories this year, forcing home evacuations, disrupting energy production, and drawing in federal as well as international firefighting resources.

More than 130,000 square kilometers of land have been scorched, the most on record for this stage in the season, and nearly 168,000 people have been forced to evacuate at some point.

Northwest Territories has so far had 265 wildfires this year, much higher than its 10-year annual average of 185.

Russian citizen sentenced to jail for attempted $3.5 bln fraud in Denmark,"COPENHAGEN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A 53-year-old Russian citizen has been sentenced to three years in prison for an attempted $3.5 billion fraud against the Danish National Bank, Danish police said in a statement on Wednesday.

The man was arrested in October last year after he entered the National Bank with fake documents, claiming to be a representative from an investment company.

""The investigation has indicated that there were attempts of serious fraud and particularly severe document forgery, which the court agreed with,"" Magnus Petersen, assistant prosecutor from the Danish prosecution authority, said in a statement.

The man, who wasn't named, has been held in custody since his arrest last year. He will not appeal the sentence.

He will serve his time in Denmark, after which he will be deported and banned from returning to the country.

"Americans back tariffs, military prep against China -Reuters/Ipsos poll","A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Bipartisan majorities of Americans favor more tariffs on Chinese goods and believe that the United States needs to step up preparations for military threats from the country, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos survey.

The two-day poll, which concluded on Tuesday, revealed deep worries among Americans about China's global influence at a time when U.S.-China relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades.

Some 66% of respondents said they were more likely to back a candidate in the 2024 presidential election who ""supports additional tariffs on Chinese imports.""

Another 66% of respondents - including 58% of Democrats and 81% of Republicans - agreed with a statement that the United States ""needs to do more to prepare for military threats from China.""

Still, just 38% of Americans supported the possible deployment of U.S. troops to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, showing the political constraints facing any president seeking U.S. military involvement in a conflict involving China.

The bipartisan concern about China helps explain the increasingly combative stances Republican presidential candidates have taken toward the world's second-largest economy.

In recent months, Republican White House hopefuls have attacked China daily, with each candidate trying to show voters that they are best positioned to take on America's geopolitical foe.

Former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have all called for the United States to end permanent normal trade relations with China, which would limit economic ties between the countries.

Biden has sought to stabilize the intense U.S.-China rivalry through high-level official engagement. But at recent fundraising events the president has called its economy a ""ticking time bomb"" and referred to its leader Xi Jinping a dictator.

DEFENDING TAIWAN?

The online Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted nationwide, collecting responses from 1,005 adults, including 443 Democrats and 346 Republicans. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points in either direction.

Seventy-five percent of Americans had a negative view toward China, while 84% saw Xi at least slightly unfavorably. Some 65% felt China's government was trying to influence the U.S. election.

While half of respondents supported aiding Taiwan with military equipment to deter a possible Chinese attack, 42% opposed deploying U.S. troops in Taiwan's defense, and 20% said they didn't know.

Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by China as its territory, is the main flashpoint in U.S. ties with China's Communist government.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns has said that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of Taiwan by 2027, though that does not necessarily mean he will go ahead with it.

Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule.

Biden said in 2022 that U.S forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, appearing to go beyond the long-standing U.S. approach of ""strategic ambiguity"" - not making clear whether it would respond militarily to such an attack.

But his administration has routinely said there has been no change to U.S. policy toward Taiwan.

Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. motorists hoping to squeeze out one last trip before the Labor Day holiday and school begins are finding pump prices that have surged to their highest level this year on tighter gasoline supplies.

Consumers tend to get a break from steeper fuel costs as peak vacation travel ebbs. But strong demand and a series of refinery outages have pushed the national average retail price to $3.86 per gallon on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association - 7% higher than a month ago. In California and Washington, prices have surged above $5 a gallon.

National retail gasoline prices will average $3.90 a gallon this month, predict analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Martin Jones, a vacationer from Massachusetts, filled up his Toyota Corolla during a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Jones said he was relieved prices were not close to the $5 a gallon level of last summer.

""Or I won't be able to make long drives like this as easily,"" Jones said.

Retail prices in the U.S. Midwest jumped as much as 21 cents a gallon in Ohio and 16 cents in Michigan in the last week on earlier-than-expected maintenance at a BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.

Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.

BELOW-AVERAGE STOCKS

""It is fairly abnormal to see prices going up"" at this time of the year, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.com. ""We tend to see prices declining going into the fall.""

Weekly U.S. gasoline stockpiles have remained below the five-year average of inventories throughout this year, setting the stage for price spikes if refining capacity is disrupted. Total U.S. gasoline stocks this month fell to 216.4 million barrels, the fifth decline in six weeks, according to U.S. government data.

At the same time, record heat levels in Texas have likely led to a sharp 2% slump in U.S. refiners' product yields over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs noted on Sunday. Small changes to the yield often add up to a meaningful decline in product availability, the bank added.

Peak hurricane season is still ahead with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week raising its outlook for storms due in part to record warm sea surface temperatures. Hurricanes can result in damage to or closures of U.S. oil refineries, particularly along the Gulf Coast.

"Americans back tariffs, military prep against China -Reuters/Ipsos poll","A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Bipartisan majorities of Americans favor more tariffs on Chinese goods and believe that the United States needs to step up preparations for military threats from the country, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos survey.

The two-day poll, which concluded on Tuesday, revealed deep worries among Americans about China's global influence at a time when U.S.-China relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades.

Some 66% of respondents said they were more likely to back a candidate in the 2024 presidential election who ""supports additional tariffs on Chinese imports.""

Another 66% of respondents - including 58% of Democrats and 81% of Republicans - agreed with a statement that the United States ""needs to do more to prepare for military threats from China.""

Still, just 38% of Americans supported the possible deployment of U.S. troops to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, showing the political constraints facing any president seeking U.S. military involvement in a conflict involving China.

The bipartisan concern about China helps explain the increasingly combative stances Republican presidential candidates have taken toward the world's second-largest economy.

In recent months, Republican White House hopefuls have attacked China daily, with each candidate trying to show voters that they are best positioned to take on America's geopolitical foe.

Former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have all called for the United States to end permanent normal trade relations with China, which would limit economic ties between the countries.

Biden has sought to stabilize the intense U.S.-China rivalry through high-level official engagement. But at recent fundraising events the president has called its economy a ""ticking time bomb"" and referred to its leader Xi Jinping a dictator.

DEFENDING TAIWAN?

The online Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted nationwide, collecting responses from 1,005 adults, including 443 Democrats and 346 Republicans. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points in either direction.

Seventy-five percent of Americans had a negative view toward China, while 84% saw Xi at least slightly unfavorably. Some 65% felt China's government was trying to influence the U.S. election.

While half of respondents supported aiding Taiwan with military equipment to deter a possible Chinese attack, 42% opposed deploying U.S. troops in Taiwan's defense, and 20% said they didn't know.

Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by China as its territory, is the main flashpoint in U.S. ties with China's Communist government.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns has said that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of Taiwan by 2027, though that does not necessarily mean he will go ahead with it.

Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule.

Biden said in 2022 that U.S forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, appearing to go beyond the long-standing U.S. approach of ""strategic ambiguity"" - not making clear whether it would respond militarily to such an attack.

But his administration has routinely said there has been no change to U.S. policy toward Taiwan.

HYDERABAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India's Amara Raja Batteries (AMAR.NS) plans to expand into the two-wheeler electric vehicle (EV) market, first through chargers and then batteries, as part of an expansion to triple its lithium-ion business this financial year, a top executive said.

Amara Raja, which currently has customers only in the three-wheeler EV market, gets about 2.5% of its revenue from its lithium-ion battery business, while the rest of its total revenue of 103.85 billion rupees ($1.25 billion) in fiscal 2023 was from its flagship lead acid storage battery-making unit.

The company, which owns the Amaron battery brand, aims to penetrate into two-wheeler EV market first with chargers and eventually through battery packs as it expands its so-called 'new energy' segment.

""This year, we're looking to grow very aggressively, that is almost going to be three times of last year,"" Executive Director Vikramadithya Gourineni said in an interview with Reuters last week.

It is also banking on its upcoming lithium cell and battery pack manufacturing units, one of India's largest, to increase production by the first quarter of the next financial year.

""We're talking to people for cell technology, chemistry development; we're even working with Indian players for raw materials,"" he said, highlighting how demand from the telecom sector is growing.

Amara Raja is also in talks with global companies to explore opportunities for ""technology transfer"" tied to lithium-ion battery manufacturing, sources told Reuters. However, Gourineni declined to provide more details.

The company has customers across the automotive, telecom and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) sectors.

Its lead acid battery arm will focus on expanding in the West and the company is in talks with eight ""large"" distributors in North America for a strategic supply partnership, Executive Director Harshavardhana Gourineni said.

""These distributors have their own brands and we're looking to offer our products. Some of these partnerships will materialise in this financial year,"" he said.

"US gasoline prices at year high, tight supply weighs on motorists","Consumers purchase gasoline at a gas station as a plane approaches to land at the airport in San Diego, California October 8, 2012. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. motorists hoping to squeeze out one last trip before the Labor Day holiday and school begins are finding pump prices that have surged to their highest level this year on tighter gasoline supplies.

Consumers tend to get a break from steeper fuel costs as peak vacation travel ebbs. But strong demand and a series of refinery outages have pushed the national average retail price to $3.86 per gallon on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association - 7% higher than a month ago. In California and Washington, prices have surged above $5 a gallon.

National retail gasoline prices will average $3.90 a gallon this month, predict analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Martin Jones, a vacationer from Massachusetts, filled up his Toyota Corolla during a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Jones said he was relieved prices were not close to the $5 a gallon level of last summer.

""Or I won't be able to make long drives like this as easily,"" Jones said.

Retail prices in the U.S. Midwest jumped as much as 21 cents a gallon in Ohio and 16 cents in Michigan in the last week on earlier-than-expected maintenance at a BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.

Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.

BELOW-AVERAGE STOCKS

""It is fairly abnormal to see prices going up"" at this time of the year, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.com. ""We tend to see prices declining going into the fall.""

Weekly U.S. gasoline stockpiles have remained below the five-year average of inventories throughout this year, setting the stage for price spikes if refining capacity is disrupted. Total U.S. gasoline stocks this month fell to 216.4 million barrels, the fifth decline in six weeks, according to U.S. government data.

At the same time, record heat levels in Texas have likely led to a sharp 2% slump in U.S. refiners' product yields over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs noted on Sunday. Small changes to the yield often add up to a meaningful decline in product availability, the bank added.

Peak hurricane season is still ahead with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week raising its outlook for storms due in part to record warm sea surface temperatures. Hurricanes can result in damage to or closures of U.S. oil refineries, particularly along the Gulf Coast.

Analysis: Country Garden undone by promise to bring 5-star life to China's hinterland,"The company logo of Chinese developer Country Garden is pictured at the Shanghai Country Garden Center in Shanghai, China August 9, 2023. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's financially beleaguered property developer Country Garden promised ""five-star living"" to the masses in less popular, smaller cities but focusing on those areas has come back to haunt it.

China's largest developer by sales value before this year, Country Garden's (2007.HK) debt crisis has raised fears that its contagion will spread through the already sputtering economy, the world's second-largest.

Smaller Chinese cities, whose revenues have already been deteriorating, could have a glut of unfinished homes, a social problem Beijing is trying to avoid.

In 2022, Country Garden made 62% of its sales in smaller, less well-known areas that include so-called tier-three and tier-four cities such as the northern city of Dezhou and Maoming in the south. More than three-quarters of its land reserve for future development was also held in these types of cities.

But as China's economy started slowing during and after its COVID-19 lockdowns, property sales in those areas has plummeted along with values of the homes themselves.

The average new home price in the 35 smallest cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics fell on a year-on-year basis for a 17th month in June.

Country Garden's sales in 2020 were 570.7 billion yuan ($78.22 billion), but that slipped to 357.5 billion yuan in 2022. Lower sales, coupled with tighter access to fresh funding in recent years worsened the cash squeeze.

""It needs at least 30 billion yuan ($4.12 billion) of sales a month to breakeven but they have been only 10 to 20 something billion yuan (a month) this year because sales in tier-three and fourth cities are very bad now,"" said Oscar Choi, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oscar and Partners Capital Limited.

HIGH VOLUME, LOW MARGIN

Country Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins. Much of its scale was achieved through acquiring large, low-cost parcels of land from local governments. The multi-purpose developments it built included hotels, shops, schools, and sometimes tech parks.

In March, Country Garden Chairperson Yang Huiyan announced the firm would reduce its presence in smaller cities, after reporting a 90% drop in core profit for 2022 and a record net loss of 6.1 billion yuan. But that has seemingly come too late.

With 3,121 projects spread across all of China's provinces, the macro context of Country Garden's financial problems could be more precarious than China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), which has only around 800 projects, Oxford Economics said in a report.

Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura.

The real estate sector contributes the bulk of revenues to local governments through property taxes and land sales. In 2022, taxes provided 6.9% of local government revenues with 23.9% from sales, for a total of 30.8%, according to a report from Lu Ting, Chief China economist at Nomura.

Land sales revenues in the first half of 2023 were only 50% of those in the same period of 2021, with smaller cities more affected since they are more dependent on land sales, the bank said.

""Moreover, as housing demand in lower-tier cities deteriorates, it is likely to create a negative feedback loop that will further worsen the already deteriorating fiscal conditions,"" Nomura said.

The contagion fears over Country Garden's debt crisis is piling pressure on Beijing to step in, analysts said.

""Property and related sectors remain an important part of (gross domestic product), and their continued decline pulls down economic activity, as well as local government finances,"" said Gerwin Bell, PGIM Fixed Income's Lead Economist for Asia.

""Arresting the adverse spillovers from property will require significantly larger fiscal stimulus than the authorities have so far entertained.""

Europe space chief warns over political wavering on climate,"A satellite image, captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission, shows a wildfire that broke out on August 5 south of Odemira in the Alentejo region in southern Portugal, as seen on August 7, 2023. The European Space Agency /Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

PARIS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Europe's top space official has urged wavering politicians not to abandon European leadership in combating climate change, saying record heatwaves and vegetation fires provide ""really alarming"" evidence of the pace of global warming.

""It is clear that climate change is very visible and is really causing enormous changes to our planet,"" Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency and a leading expert on environmental observation, told Reuters.

Greece, Italy, Spain and most recently Portugal have grappled with record-breaking temperatures and wildfires this summer.

The World Meterological Organization said July had the highest global average temperature for any month on record.

""This is really alarming,"" Aschbacher said. ""It just confirms that climate change is the biggest threat to our planet, to humankind, and will remain so for the next decades and we do need to do everything we can to mitigate the effects.""

Until 2021, when he stepped up to run the 22-nation agency, Aschbacher ran ESA's flagship Earth observation satellite activities including Copernicus, which the Paris-based agency says is the world's largest environmental monitoring effort.

ESA last week released a Copernicus image of a wildfire that razed thousands of hectares of forest in southern Portugal - a blaze that has since been brought under control.

Scientists say climate change is making heatwaves more frequent, intense and likely to happen across seasons, not just in what were regarded as the summer months.

But pressure is growing on some governments over the cost of net-zero commitments on emissions, and analysts say looming elections in Europe could put future measures at risk.

In Britain, where general elections are scheduled within 18 months, Prime Mininster Rishi Sunak has warned of climate policies that ""unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs"".

Ashbacher said long-term costs were likely to be far higher unless governments respond to ""crystal clear"" evidence, including satellite measurements, of the recent heat emergency in southern Europe.

""Acting now is much cheaper than waiting for years and then patching up the damage that has been caused,"" he said when asked if he saw any signs of drift in Europe's climate agenda.

""So yes, the alarm bells should still be ringing very loud. And it is certainly concerning if the signals are not heard in politics as they should be heard, in order to really save our planet."" He did not single out specific politicians or states.

FUNDING GAP AND 'GLOBAL BOILING'

Aschbacher is among the most senior climate-monitoring officials to voice concerns over wavering support for measures to combat climate change - a creeping negative reaction that some climate activists have labelled ""greenlash"".

After scientists declared July the world's hottest month on record, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said ""the era of global boiling has arrived"".

ESA's Copernicus programme involves six families of Sentinel satellites designed to read the planet's ""vital signs"" from carbon dioxide to wave height or land and ocean temperatures.

Plans for six more ""Sentinel Expansion"" missions starting from 2026 are in flux because of a funding gap of 721 million euros ($787.84 million), stemming mainly from the partial loss of UK contributions following its exit from the European Union.

Negotiations have been under way for months between Britain and the European Commission over whether and to what extent Britain should continue to contribute funds to Copernicus via the EU, which co-leads the satellite programme alongside ESA.

Britain's smaller direct contribution to Copernicus as one of the core member nations of ESA itself is unaffected.

Britain's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Although it is not part of the talks, Aschbacher said ESA needs a funding decision by June 2024 ""to continue development of the next set of Sentinel satellites in an uninterrupted way"".

Failure to meet that deadline would kick the funding decision into the next planning period from 2028, Aschbacher said. Suspending work on the next round of satellites would also drive up costs by damaging continuity and send the wrong message about Europe's leadership on climate issues, he said.

""The impact would be very significant because the Sentinels are required in order to provide a number of critical climate parameters. This would significantly impact Europe’s commitment to combating climate change.""

Canada's Northwest Territories declares emergency due to wildfires,"Companies City of Yellowknife Follow

OTTAWA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The government of Canada's Northwest Territories declared a state of emergency on Tuesday due to wildfires that have largely destroyed one remote community and are also posing a risk to territorial capital Yellowknife.

The declaration gives authorities additional powers to respond to an emergency, and underscores the unparalleled damage wrought by blazes so far this year.

""This allows the (government) to acquire and deploy the necessary resources to support the management of this unprecedented wildfire season, and protect the health and safety of Northwest Territories residents,"" the territorial government said in a statement.

The Canadian government said on Tuesday it approved federal assistance to combat the wildfires, and deployed armed forces to help with firefighting efforts in the area.

“We are working closely with the Government of the Northwest Territories to ensure communities have the support they need,"" Canadian federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said in a statement.

The city of Yellowknife also declared a state of local emergency late on Monday to brace for potential risks from nearby wildfires. The declaration was made as a precaution and residents have not been put on an evacuation notice, city officials said in a statement.

""Residents should remain calm and ensure they are prepared in the event that the situation changes,"" said Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty.

Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and sits 450 km (280 miles) south of the Arctic Circle. With about 20,000 residents, it is one of the largest settlements in the sparsely populated north.

Over the weekend, residents of most communities in the South Slave region of the Northwest Territories, situated along the Alberta border, were ordered to evacuate.

The hamlet of Enterprise, a settlement of just over 100 people, was almost completely destroyed by fire, CBC News reported on Tuesday, quoting Enterprise's mayor.

Wildfires have engulfed parts of nearly all 13 Canadian provinces and territories this year, forcing home evacuations, disrupting energy production, and drawing in federal as well as international firefighting resources.

More than 130,000 square kilometers of land have been scorched, the most on record for this stage in the season, and nearly 168,000 people have been forced to evacuate at some point.

Northwest Territories has so far had 265 wildfires this year, much higher than its 10-year annual average of 185.

Country Garden's sales in 2020 were 570.7 billion yuan ($78.22 billion), but that slipped to 357.5 billion yuan in 2022. Lower sales, coupled with tighter access to fresh funding in recent years worsened the cash squeeze.

""It needs at least 30 billion yuan ($4.12 billion) of sales a month to breakeven but they have been only 10 to 20 something billion yuan (a month) this year because sales in tier-three and fourth cities are very bad now,"" said Oscar Choi, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oscar and Partners Capital Limited.

HIGH VOLUME, LOW MARGIN

Country Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins. Much of its scale was achieved through acquiring large, low-cost parcels of land from local governments. The multi-purpose developments it built included hotels, shops, schools, and sometimes tech parks.

In March, Country Garden Chairperson Yang Huiyan announced the firm would reduce its presence in smaller cities, after reporting a 90% drop in core profit for 2022 and a record net loss of 6.1 billion yuan. But that has seemingly come too late.

With 3,121 projects spread across all of China's provinces, the macro context of Country Garden's financial problems could be more precarious than China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), which has only around 800 projects, Oxford Economics said in a report.

Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura.

The real estate sector contributes the bulk of revenues to local governments through property taxes and land sales. In 2022, taxes provided 6.9% of local government revenues with 23.9% from sales, for a total of 30.8%, according to a report from Lu Ting, Chief China economist at Nomura.

Land sales revenues in the first half of 2023 were only 50% of those in the same period of 2021, with smaller cities more affected since they are more dependent on land sales, the bank said.

""Moreover, as housing demand in lower-tier cities deteriorates, it is likely to create a negative feedback loop that will further worsen the already deteriorating fiscal conditions,"" Nomura said.

The contagion fears over Country Garden's debt crisis is piling pressure on Beijing to step in, analysts said.

""Property and related sectors remain an important part of (gross domestic product), and their continued decline pulls down economic activity, as well as local government finances,"" said Gerwin Bell, PGIM Fixed Income's Lead Economist for Asia.

""Arresting the adverse spillovers from property will require significantly larger fiscal stimulus than the authorities have so far entertained.""

Summary US crude stockpiles fall by nearly 6 million barrels - EIA

Minutes of Fed meeting due at 1800 GMT

Concerns on China's economy remain key price driver

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Wednesday despite a large drawdown in U.S. crude oil stocks as investors weighed worries about China's embattled economy against expectations of tighter supply in the United States.

Brent crude futures edged up 6 cents to $84.95 a barrel by 11:35 a.m. EDT (1535 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 2 cents higher to $80.97 a barrel.

Both benchmarks fell more than 1% in the previous session to their lowest since Aug. 8.

U.S. crude oil inventories fell by nearly 6 million barrels last week on strong exports and refining run rates, despite crude production rising to its highest since the coronavirus pandemic decimated fuel consumption, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday.

However, product supplied of gasoline fell by 451,000 barrels per day in the week as peak driving season draws to a close.

""We're still seeing a subpar gasoline number...it looks like we're past peak summer travel season for many,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

China's sluggish economy has remained in focus, after retail sales, industrial output and investment figures failed to match expectations, fuelling concern over a deeper, longer-lasting slowdown.

July activity figures have prompted concerns that China may struggle to meet its growth target of about 5% for the year without more fiscal stimulus, and calls for authorities to take decisive steps.

Without giving details, a cabinet meeting chaired on Wednesday by Premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies aimed at boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Both the OPEC+ group, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are banking on China - the world's biggest oil importer - to galvanise crude demand over the rest of 2023.

Whilst dismal Chinese economic indicators have been causing headaches, providing a justified excuse for investors to go on the defensive, the global oil balance shows no signs of loosening up, PVM analyst Tamas Varga said, citing the latest numbers on U.S. crude inventories.

Investors will also have eyes on minutes from the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting for further cues on interest rate strategy at the world's biggest oil consumer.

The outlook in the fourth quarter will ""depend on the macroeconomic situation in China primarily, albeit it looks like Saudi will continue to address that via their cuts, if needed"", said Rystad Energy's research director Claudio Galimberti.

Supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia have pushed up oil prices over the past seven weeks. Figures published on Wednesday showed that Riyadh's crude exports fell to their lowest since September 2021.

Canada's Northwest Territories declares emergency due to wildfires,"Companies City of Yellowknife Follow

OTTAWA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The government of Canada's Northwest Territories declared a state of emergency on Tuesday due to wildfires that have largely destroyed one remote community and are also posing a risk to territorial capital Yellowknife.

The declaration gives authorities additional powers to respond to an emergency, and underscores the unparalleled damage wrought by blazes so far this year.

""This allows the (government) to acquire and deploy the necessary resources to support the management of this unprecedented wildfire season, and protect the health and safety of Northwest Territories residents,"" the territorial government said in a statement.

The Canadian government said on Tuesday it approved federal assistance to combat the wildfires, and deployed armed forces to help with firefighting efforts in the area.

“We are working closely with the Government of the Northwest Territories to ensure communities have the support they need,"" Canadian federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Harjit Sajjan said in a statement.

The city of Yellowknife also declared a state of local emergency late on Monday to brace for potential risks from nearby wildfires. The declaration was made as a precaution and residents have not been put on an evacuation notice, city officials said in a statement.

""Residents should remain calm and ensure they are prepared in the event that the situation changes,"" said Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty.

Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and sits 450 km (280 miles) south of the Arctic Circle. With about 20,000 residents, it is one of the largest settlements in the sparsely populated north.

Over the weekend, residents of most communities in the South Slave region of the Northwest Territories, situated along the Alberta border, were ordered to evacuate.

The hamlet of Enterprise, a settlement of just over 100 people, was almost completely destroyed by fire, CBC News reported on Tuesday, quoting Enterprise's mayor.

Wildfires have engulfed parts of nearly all 13 Canadian provinces and territories this year, forcing home evacuations, disrupting energy production, and drawing in federal as well as international firefighting resources.

More than 130,000 square kilometers of land have been scorched, the most on record for this stage in the season, and nearly 168,000 people have been forced to evacuate at some point.

Northwest Territories has so far had 265 wildfires this year, much higher than its 10-year annual average of 185.

The man was arrested in October last year after he entered the National Bank with fake documents, claiming to be a representative from an investment company.

""The investigation has indicated that there were attempts of serious fraud and particularly severe document forgery, which the court agreed with,"" Magnus Petersen, assistant prosecutor from the Danish prosecution authority, said in a statement.

The man, who wasn't named, has been held in custody since his arrest last year. He will not appeal the sentence.

He will serve his time in Denmark, after which he will be deported and banned from returning to the country.

"Americans back tariffs, military prep against China -Reuters/Ipsos poll","A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Bipartisan majorities of Americans favor more tariffs on Chinese goods and believe that the United States needs to step up preparations for military threats from the country, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos survey.

The two-day poll, which concluded on Tuesday, revealed deep worries among Americans about China's global influence at a time when U.S.-China relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades.

Some 66% of respondents said they were more likely to back a candidate in the 2024 presidential election who ""supports additional tariffs on Chinese imports.""

Another 66% of respondents - including 58% of Democrats and 81% of Republicans - agreed with a statement that the United States ""needs to do more to prepare for military threats from China.""

Still, just 38% of Americans supported the possible deployment of U.S. troops to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, showing the political constraints facing any president seeking U.S. military involvement in a conflict involving China.

The bipartisan concern about China helps explain the increasingly combative stances Republican presidential candidates have taken toward the world's second-largest economy.

In recent months, Republican White House hopefuls have attacked China daily, with each candidate trying to show voters that they are best positioned to take on America's geopolitical foe.

Former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have all called for the United States to end permanent normal trade relations with China, which would limit economic ties between the countries.

Biden has sought to stabilize the intense U.S.-China rivalry through high-level official engagement. But at recent fundraising events the president has called its economy a ""ticking time bomb"" and referred to its leader Xi Jinping a dictator.

DEFENDING TAIWAN?

The online Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted nationwide, collecting responses from 1,005 adults, including 443 Democrats and 346 Republicans. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points in either direction.

Seventy-five percent of Americans had a negative view toward China, while 84% saw Xi at least slightly unfavorably. Some 65% felt China's government was trying to influence the U.S. election.

While half of respondents supported aiding Taiwan with military equipment to deter a possible Chinese attack, 42% opposed deploying U.S. troops in Taiwan's defense, and 20% said they didn't know.

Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by China as its territory, is the main flashpoint in U.S. ties with China's Communist government.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns has said that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of Taiwan by 2027, though that does not necessarily mean he will go ahead with it.

Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule.

Biden said in 2022 that U.S forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, appearing to go beyond the long-standing U.S. approach of ""strategic ambiguity"" - not making clear whether it would respond militarily to such an attack.

But his administration has routinely said there has been no change to U.S. policy toward Taiwan.

HYDERABAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India's Amara Raja Batteries (AMAR.NS) plans to expand into the two-wheeler electric vehicle (EV) market, first through chargers and then batteries, as part of an expansion to triple its lithium-ion business this financial year, a top executive said.

Amara Raja, which currently has customers only in the three-wheeler EV market, gets about 2.5% of its revenue from its lithium-ion battery business, while the rest of its total revenue of 103.85 billion rupees ($1.25 billion) in fiscal 2023 was from its flagship lead acid storage battery-making unit.

The company, which owns the Amaron battery brand, aims to penetrate into two-wheeler EV market first with chargers and eventually through battery packs as it expands its so-called 'new energy' segment.

""This year, we're looking to grow very aggressively, that is almost going to be three times of last year,"" Executive Director Vikramadithya Gourineni said in an interview with Reuters last week.

It is also banking on its upcoming lithium cell and battery pack manufacturing units, one of India's largest, to increase production by the first quarter of the next financial year.

""We're talking to people for cell technology, chemistry development; we're even working with Indian players for raw materials,"" he said, highlighting how demand from the telecom sector is growing.

Amara Raja is also in talks with global companies to explore opportunities for ""technology transfer"" tied to lithium-ion battery manufacturing, sources told Reuters. However, Gourineni declined to provide more details.

The company has customers across the automotive, telecom and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) sectors.

Its lead acid battery arm will focus on expanding in the West and the company is in talks with eight ""large"" distributors in North America for a strategic supply partnership, Executive Director Harshavardhana Gourineni said.

""These distributors have their own brands and we're looking to offer our products. Some of these partnerships will materialise in this financial year,"" he said.

Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. motorists hoping to squeeze out one last trip before the Labor Day holiday and school begins are finding pump prices that have surged to their highest level this year on tighter gasoline supplies.

Consumers tend to get a break from steeper fuel costs as peak vacation travel ebbs. But strong demand and a series of refinery outages have pushed the national average retail price to $3.86 per gallon on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association - 7% higher than a month ago. In California and Washington, prices have surged above $5 a gallon.

National retail gasoline prices will average $3.90 a gallon this month, predict analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Martin Jones, a vacationer from Massachusetts, filled up his Toyota Corolla during a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Jones said he was relieved prices were not close to the $5 a gallon level of last summer.

""Or I won't be able to make long drives like this as easily,"" Jones said.

Retail prices in the U.S. Midwest jumped as much as 21 cents a gallon in Ohio and 16 cents in Michigan in the last week on earlier-than-expected maintenance at a BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.

Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.

BELOW-AVERAGE STOCKS

""It is fairly abnormal to see prices going up"" at this time of the year, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.com. ""We tend to see prices declining going into the fall.""

Weekly U.S. gasoline stockpiles have remained below the five-year average of inventories throughout this year, setting the stage for price spikes if refining capacity is disrupted. Total U.S. gasoline stocks this month fell to 216.4 million barrels, the fifth decline in six weeks, according to U.S. government data.

At the same time, record heat levels in Texas have likely led to a sharp 2% slump in U.S. refiners' product yields over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs noted on Sunday. Small changes to the yield often add up to a meaningful decline in product availability, the bank added.

Peak hurricane season is still ahead with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week raising its outlook for storms due in part to record warm sea surface temperatures. Hurricanes can result in damage to or closures of U.S. oil refineries, particularly along the Gulf Coast.

HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's financially beleaguered property developer Country Garden promised ""five-star living"" to the masses in less popular, smaller cities but focusing on those areas has come back to haunt it.

China's largest developer by sales value before this year, Country Garden's (2007.HK) debt crisis has raised fears that its contagion will spread through the already sputtering economy, the world's second-largest.

Smaller Chinese cities, whose revenues have already been deteriorating, could have a glut of unfinished homes, a social problem Beijing is trying to avoid.

In 2022, Country Garden made 62% of its sales in smaller, less well-known areas that include so-called tier-three and tier-four cities such as the northern city of Dezhou and Maoming in the south. More than three-quarters of its land reserve for future development was also held in these types of cities.

But as China's economy started slowing during and after its COVID-19 lockdowns, property sales in those areas has plummeted along with values of the homes themselves.

The average new home price in the 35 smallest cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics fell on a year-on-year basis for a 17th month in June.

Country Garden's sales in 2020 were 570.7 billion yuan ($78.22 billion), but that slipped to 357.5 billion yuan in 2022. Lower sales, coupled with tighter access to fresh funding in recent years worsened the cash squeeze.

""It needs at least 30 billion yuan ($4.12 billion) of sales a month to breakeven but they have been only 10 to 20 something billion yuan (a month) this year because sales in tier-three and fourth cities are very bad now,"" said Oscar Choi, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oscar and Partners Capital Limited.

HIGH VOLUME, LOW MARGIN

Country Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins. Much of its scale was achieved through acquiring large, low-cost parcels of land from local governments. The multi-purpose developments it built included hotels, shops, schools, and sometimes tech parks.

In March, Country Garden Chairperson Yang Huiyan announced the firm would reduce its presence in smaller cities, after reporting a 90% drop in core profit for 2022 and a record net loss of 6.1 billion yuan. But that has seemingly come too late.

With 3,121 projects spread across all of China's provinces, the macro context of Country Garden's financial problems could be more precarious than China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), which has only around 800 projects, Oxford Economics said in a report.

Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura.

Maui's displaced grow anxious as wildfire recovery drags on,"LAHAINA, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A week after wildfire ravaged the resort town of Lahaina, traumatized Maui residents have grown weary from living off relief supplies while many are kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news about their missing loved one.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Kiet Ma, a 56-year-old taxi driver who lost his home, said he found the local disaster response disorganized.

""The police, everyone, first responders, they're all rushing in but not enough manpower, and it's chaos,"" Ma said from his in-laws' home on the outskirts of Lahaina, where he is staying indefinitely.

Even as donations have poured in and Hawaii and federal officials have promised vast resources to aid in the recovery, Kanamu Balinbin, a local football coach, took matters into his own hands, setting up a relief camp where people who lost their homes and belongings could find water and food.

""I was devastated. I consider myself a strong leader, but it broke me,"" Balinbin said about his emotions after witnessing the destruction. ""This is what keeps me going, helping people. A lot of us are at that stage.""

He said some of the local frustration stemmed from the longstanding perception that Maui does not receive enough attention from the state government despite its robust tourism revenues.

Mary Kerstulovich, a Maui real estate agent who has sought supplies and housing for evacuees, said there was finally a sense government relief was arriving a full week after the disaster, but she said Lahaina still needed a more effective plan to obtain goods.

""There is still a lot of chaos. People need supplies still,"" Kerstulovich said.

Keith Turi, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's deputy associate administrator for response and recovery, acknowledged the deep sense of loss felt by survivors, but said FEMA had a warehouse of supplies in Hawaii and was working with state and county officials to supply shelters and relief operations.

""In the days immediately after something like this, there's a range of frustrations and challenges. But we feel like that in coordination with our partners that we are well positioned to be providing that support,"" Turi told reporters.

The fire destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.

Adding to the local frustration, few residents have been permitted back into Lahaina to visit their properties. Hawaii Governor Josh Green announced Tuesday night that Lahaina residents and employees would be allowed onto a highway leading to town. A previous relaxation of the road closure was soon halted after curiosity seekers clogged streets being used by rescue workers.

Meanwhile, up to 20 cadaver dogs have led search teams on a block-by-block search of the ashes, covering 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Green said in a televised address.

Bar chart shows visitor spending share of GDP to Maui and Hawaii which are much higher than that for the entire U.S.

President Joe Biden has said he would like to visit Maui as soon as possible, which Green said would be ""in the coming weeks"" to avoid disrupting recovery efforts.

""He did not want to interfere with the incredibly difficult emotional, physical work that goes on in a disaster zone,"" Green said after speaking with the president.

Only three of the deceased had been officially identified as of Monday, police said, but stories about those who perished have begun to emerge from friends and relatives.

On the fundraising website GoFundMe, relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home on Thursday morning.

""Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family,"" the post said, noting that the Tanakas have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.

Another post described how Joe Schilling - ""Uncle Joe"" to his adopted family, the Bluhs - died while helping five elderly people escape from his housing complex.

""He was known as 'Funcle Joe' for a reason,"" Akiva Bluh wrote. ""Whether it be the trips to go bullet-shell hunting or staying up late while my parents were gone so he could sneak us his famous sugar toast, he was always willing to act out of love and kindness towards myself and my brothers.""

Yellowknife is the capital of the Northwest Territories and sits 450 km (280 miles) south of the Arctic Circle. With about 20,000 residents, it is one of the largest settlements in the sparsely populated north.

Over the weekend, residents of most communities in the South Slave region of the Northwest Territories, situated along the Alberta border, were ordered to evacuate.

The hamlet of Enterprise, a settlement of just over 100 people, was almost completely destroyed by fire, CBC News reported on Tuesday, quoting Enterprise's mayor.

Wildfires have engulfed parts of nearly all 13 Canadian provinces and territories this year, forcing home evacuations, disrupting energy production, and drawing in federal as well as international firefighting resources.

More than 130,000 square kilometers of land have been scorched, the most on record for this stage in the season, and nearly 168,000 people have been forced to evacuate at some point.

Northwest Territories has so far had 265 wildfires this year, much higher than its 10-year annual average of 185.

"Americans back tariffs, military prep against China -Reuters/Ipsos poll","A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Bipartisan majorities of Americans favor more tariffs on Chinese goods and believe that the United States needs to step up preparations for military threats from the country, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos survey.

The two-day poll, which concluded on Tuesday, revealed deep worries among Americans about China's global influence at a time when U.S.-China relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades.

Some 66% of respondents said they were more likely to back a candidate in the 2024 presidential election who ""supports additional tariffs on Chinese imports.""

Another 66% of respondents - including 58% of Democrats and 81% of Republicans - agreed with a statement that the United States ""needs to do more to prepare for military threats from China.""

Still, just 38% of Americans supported the possible deployment of U.S. troops to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, showing the political constraints facing any president seeking U.S. military involvement in a conflict involving China.

The bipartisan concern about China helps explain the increasingly combative stances Republican presidential candidates have taken toward the world's second-largest economy.

In recent months, Republican White House hopefuls have attacked China daily, with each candidate trying to show voters that they are best positioned to take on America's geopolitical foe.

Former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have all called for the United States to end permanent normal trade relations with China, which would limit economic ties between the countries.

Biden has sought to stabilize the intense U.S.-China rivalry through high-level official engagement. But at recent fundraising events the president has called its economy a ""ticking time bomb"" and referred to its leader Xi Jinping a dictator.

DEFENDING TAIWAN?

The online Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted nationwide, collecting responses from 1,005 adults, including 443 Democrats and 346 Republicans. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points in either direction.

Seventy-five percent of Americans had a negative view toward China, while 84% saw Xi at least slightly unfavorably. Some 65% felt China's government was trying to influence the U.S. election.

While half of respondents supported aiding Taiwan with military equipment to deter a possible Chinese attack, 42% opposed deploying U.S. troops in Taiwan's defense, and 20% said they didn't know.

Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by China as its territory, is the main flashpoint in U.S. ties with China's Communist government.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns has said that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of Taiwan by 2027, though that does not necessarily mean he will go ahead with it.

Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule.

Biden said in 2022 that U.S forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, appearing to go beyond the long-standing U.S. approach of ""strategic ambiguity"" - not making clear whether it would respond militarily to such an attack.

But his administration has routinely said there has been no change to U.S. policy toward Taiwan.

HYDERABAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India's Amara Raja Batteries (AMAR.NS) plans to expand into the two-wheeler electric vehicle (EV) market, first through chargers and then batteries, as part of an expansion to triple its lithium-ion business this financial year, a top executive said.

Amara Raja, which currently has customers only in the three-wheeler EV market, gets about 2.5% of its revenue from its lithium-ion battery business, while the rest of its total revenue of 103.85 billion rupees ($1.25 billion) in fiscal 2023 was from its flagship lead acid storage battery-making unit.

The company, which owns the Amaron battery brand, aims to penetrate into two-wheeler EV market first with chargers and eventually through battery packs as it expands its so-called 'new energy' segment.

""This year, we're looking to grow very aggressively, that is almost going to be three times of last year,"" Executive Director Vikramadithya Gourineni said in an interview with Reuters last week.

It is also banking on its upcoming lithium cell and battery pack manufacturing units, one of India's largest, to increase production by the first quarter of the next financial year.

""We're talking to people for cell technology, chemistry development; we're even working with Indian players for raw materials,"" he said, highlighting how demand from the telecom sector is growing.

Amara Raja is also in talks with global companies to explore opportunities for ""technology transfer"" tied to lithium-ion battery manufacturing, sources told Reuters. However, Gourineni declined to provide more details.

The company has customers across the automotive, telecom and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) sectors.

Its lead acid battery arm will focus on expanding in the West and the company is in talks with eight ""large"" distributors in North America for a strategic supply partnership, Executive Director Harshavardhana Gourineni said.

""These distributors have their own brands and we're looking to offer our products. Some of these partnerships will materialise in this financial year,"" he said.

"US gasoline prices at year high, tight supply weighs on motorists","Consumers purchase gasoline at a gas station as a plane approaches to land at the airport in San Diego, California October 8, 2012. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. motorists hoping to squeeze out one last trip before the Labor Day holiday and school begins are finding pump prices that have surged to their highest level this year on tighter gasoline supplies.

Consumers tend to get a break from steeper fuel costs as peak vacation travel ebbs. But strong demand and a series of refinery outages have pushed the national average retail price to $3.86 per gallon on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association - 7% higher than a month ago. In California and Washington, prices have surged above $5 a gallon.

National retail gasoline prices will average $3.90 a gallon this month, predict analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Martin Jones, a vacationer from Massachusetts, filled up his Toyota Corolla during a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Jones said he was relieved prices were not close to the $5 a gallon level of last summer.

""Or I won't be able to make long drives like this as easily,"" Jones said.

Retail prices in the U.S. Midwest jumped as much as 21 cents a gallon in Ohio and 16 cents in Michigan in the last week on earlier-than-expected maintenance at a BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.

Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.

BELOW-AVERAGE STOCKS

""It is fairly abnormal to see prices going up"" at this time of the year, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.com. ""We tend to see prices declining going into the fall.""

Weekly U.S. gasoline stockpiles have remained below the five-year average of inventories throughout this year, setting the stage for price spikes if refining capacity is disrupted. Total U.S. gasoline stocks this month fell to 216.4 million barrels, the fifth decline in six weeks, according to U.S. government data.

At the same time, record heat levels in Texas have likely led to a sharp 2% slump in U.S. refiners' product yields over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs noted on Sunday. Small changes to the yield often add up to a meaningful decline in product availability, the bank added.

Peak hurricane season is still ahead with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week raising its outlook for storms due in part to record warm sea surface temperatures. Hurricanes can result in damage to or closures of U.S. oil refineries, particularly along the Gulf Coast.

Analysis: Country Garden undone by promise to bring 5-star life to China's hinterland,"The company logo of Chinese developer Country Garden is pictured at the Shanghai Country Garden Center in Shanghai, China August 9, 2023. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's financially beleaguered property developer Country Garden promised ""five-star living"" to the masses in less popular, smaller cities but focusing on those areas has come back to haunt it.

China's largest developer by sales value before this year, Country Garden's (2007.HK) debt crisis has raised fears that its contagion will spread through the already sputtering economy, the world's second-largest.

Smaller Chinese cities, whose revenues have already been deteriorating, could have a glut of unfinished homes, a social problem Beijing is trying to avoid.

In 2022, Country Garden made 62% of its sales in smaller, less well-known areas that include so-called tier-three and tier-four cities such as the northern city of Dezhou and Maoming in the south. More than three-quarters of its land reserve for future development was also held in these types of cities.

But as China's economy started slowing during and after its COVID-19 lockdowns, property sales in those areas has plummeted along with values of the homes themselves.

The average new home price in the 35 smallest cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics fell on a year-on-year basis for a 17th month in June.

Country Garden's sales in 2020 were 570.7 billion yuan ($78.22 billion), but that slipped to 357.5 billion yuan in 2022. Lower sales, coupled with tighter access to fresh funding in recent years worsened the cash squeeze.

""It needs at least 30 billion yuan ($4.12 billion) of sales a month to breakeven but they have been only 10 to 20 something billion yuan (a month) this year because sales in tier-three and fourth cities are very bad now,"" said Oscar Choi, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oscar and Partners Capital Limited.

HIGH VOLUME, LOW MARGIN

Country Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins. Much of its scale was achieved through acquiring large, low-cost parcels of land from local governments. The multi-purpose developments it built included hotels, shops, schools, and sometimes tech parks.

In March, Country Garden Chairperson Yang Huiyan announced the firm would reduce its presence in smaller cities, after reporting a 90% drop in core profit for 2022 and a record net loss of 6.1 billion yuan. But that has seemingly come too late.

With 3,121 projects spread across all of China's provinces, the macro context of Country Garden's financial problems could be more precarious than China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), which has only around 800 projects, Oxford Economics said in a report.

Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura.

The real estate sector contributes the bulk of revenues to local governments through property taxes and land sales. In 2022, taxes provided 6.9% of local government revenues with 23.9% from sales, for a total of 30.8%, according to a report from Lu Ting, Chief China economist at Nomura.

Land sales revenues in the first half of 2023 were only 50% of those in the same period of 2021, with smaller cities more affected since they are more dependent on land sales, the bank said.

""Moreover, as housing demand in lower-tier cities deteriorates, it is likely to create a negative feedback loop that will further worsen the already deteriorating fiscal conditions,"" Nomura said.

The contagion fears over Country Garden's debt crisis is piling pressure on Beijing to step in, analysts said.

""Property and related sectors remain an important part of (gross domestic product), and their continued decline pulls down economic activity, as well as local government finances,"" said Gerwin Bell, PGIM Fixed Income's Lead Economist for Asia.

""Arresting the adverse spillovers from property will require significantly larger fiscal stimulus than the authorities have so far entertained.""

Summary US crude stockpiles fall by nearly 6 million barrels - EIA

Minutes of Fed meeting due at 1800 GMT

Concerns on China's economy remain key price driver

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Wednesday despite a large drawdown in U.S. crude oil stocks as investors weighed worries about China's embattled economy against expectations of tighter supply in the United States.

Brent crude futures edged up 6 cents to $84.95 a barrel by 11:35 a.m. EDT (1535 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 2 cents higher to $80.97 a barrel.

Both benchmarks fell more than 1% in the previous session to their lowest since Aug. 8.

U.S. crude oil inventories fell by nearly 6 million barrels last week on strong exports and refining run rates, despite crude production rising to its highest since the coronavirus pandemic decimated fuel consumption, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday.

However, product supplied of gasoline fell by 451,000 barrels per day in the week as peak driving season draws to a close.

""We're still seeing a subpar gasoline number...it looks like we're past peak summer travel season for many,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

China's sluggish economy has remained in focus, after retail sales, industrial output and investment figures failed to match expectations, fuelling concern over a deeper, longer-lasting slowdown.

July activity figures have prompted concerns that China may struggle to meet its growth target of about 5% for the year without more fiscal stimulus, and calls for authorities to take decisive steps.

Without giving details, a cabinet meeting chaired on Wednesday by Premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies aimed at boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Both the OPEC+ group, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are banking on China - the world's biggest oil importer - to galvanise crude demand over the rest of 2023.

Whilst dismal Chinese economic indicators have been causing headaches, providing a justified excuse for investors to go on the defensive, the global oil balance shows no signs of loosening up, PVM analyst Tamas Varga said, citing the latest numbers on U.S. crude inventories.

Investors will also have eyes on minutes from the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting for further cues on interest rate strategy at the world's biggest oil consumer.

The outlook in the fourth quarter will ""depend on the macroeconomic situation in China primarily, albeit it looks like Saudi will continue to address that via their cuts, if needed"", said Rystad Energy's research director Claudio Galimberti.

Supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia have pushed up oil prices over the past seven weeks. Figures published on Wednesday showed that Riyadh's crude exports fell to their lowest since September 2021.

Maui's displaced grow anxious as wildfire recovery drags on,"LAHAINA, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A week after wildfire ravaged the resort town of Lahaina, traumatized Maui residents have grown weary from living off relief supplies while many are kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news about their missing loved one.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Kiet Ma, a 56-year-old taxi driver who lost his home, said he found the local disaster response disorganized.

""The police, everyone, first responders, they're all rushing in but not enough manpower, and it's chaos,"" Ma said from his in-laws' home on the outskirts of Lahaina, where he is staying indefinitely.

Even as donations have poured in and Hawaii and federal officials have promised vast resources to aid in the recovery, Kanamu Balinbin, a local football coach, took matters into his own hands, setting up a relief camp where people who lost their homes and belongings could find water and food.

""I was devastated. I consider myself a strong leader, but it broke me,"" Balinbin said about his emotions after witnessing the destruction. ""This is what keeps me going, helping people. A lot of us are at that stage.""

He said some of the local frustration stemmed from the longstanding perception that Maui does not receive enough attention from the state government despite its robust tourism revenues.

Mary Kerstulovich, a Maui real estate agent who has sought supplies and housing for evacuees, said there was finally a sense government relief was arriving a full week after the disaster, but she said Lahaina still needed a more effective plan to obtain goods.

""There is still a lot of chaos. People need supplies still,"" Kerstulovich said.

Keith Turi, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's deputy associate administrator for response and recovery, acknowledged the deep sense of loss felt by survivors, but said FEMA had a warehouse of supplies in Hawaii and was working with state and county officials to supply shelters and relief operations.

""In the days immediately after something like this, there's a range of frustrations and challenges. But we feel like that in coordination with our partners that we are well positioned to be providing that support,"" Turi told reporters.

The fire destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.

Adding to the local frustration, few residents have been permitted back into Lahaina to visit their properties. Hawaii Governor Josh Green announced Tuesday night that Lahaina residents and employees would be allowed onto a highway leading to town. A previous relaxation of the road closure was soon halted after curiosity seekers clogged streets being used by rescue workers.

Meanwhile, up to 20 cadaver dogs have led search teams on a block-by-block search of the ashes, covering 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Green said in a televised address.

Bar chart shows visitor spending share of GDP to Maui and Hawaii which are much higher than that for the entire U.S.

President Joe Biden has said he would like to visit Maui as soon as possible, which Green said would be ""in the coming weeks"" to avoid disrupting recovery efforts.

""He did not want to interfere with the incredibly difficult emotional, physical work that goes on in a disaster zone,"" Green said after speaking with the president.

Only three of the deceased had been officially identified as of Monday, police said, but stories about those who perished have begun to emerge from friends and relatives.

On the fundraising website GoFundMe, relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home on Thursday morning.

""Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family,"" the post said, noting that the Tanakas have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.

Another post described how Joe Schilling - ""Uncle Joe"" to his adopted family, the Bluhs - died while helping five elderly people escape from his housing complex.

""He was known as 'Funcle Joe' for a reason,"" Akiva Bluh wrote. ""Whether it be the trips to go bullet-shell hunting or staying up late while my parents were gone so he could sneak us his famous sugar toast, he was always willing to act out of love and kindness towards myself and my brothers.""

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2023, even as the bloc's economy grew slightly, statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.

The EU's emissions over the January to March quarter amounted to 941 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, down 2.9% from a year earlier, while the economy grew 1.2% year-on-year.

As the world grapples with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather from climate change, including heatwaves in Portugal and Spain, the EU is pushing towards its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year it banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.

Emissions fell in 21 of the bloc's 27 countries, with the largest decreases seen in Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovenia. They grew however in Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Households were responsible for the biggest share - nearly a quarter - of total greenhouse gas emissions, Eurostat said, while manufacturing accounted for a fifth.

Electricity and gas supply - the sector where emissions fell the most - still contributed 19% to the total figure, with agriculture accounting for 13% and transportation and storage responsible for 10%.

Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.

BELOW-AVERAGE STOCKS

""It is fairly abnormal to see prices going up"" at this time of the year, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.com. ""We tend to see prices declining going into the fall.""

Weekly U.S. gasoline stockpiles have remained below the five-year average of inventories throughout this year, setting the stage for price spikes if refining capacity is disrupted. Total U.S. gasoline stocks this month fell to 216.4 million barrels, the fifth decline in six weeks, according to U.S. government data.

At the same time, record heat levels in Texas have likely led to a sharp 2% slump in U.S. refiners' product yields over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs noted on Sunday. Small changes to the yield often add up to a meaningful decline in product availability, the bank added.

Peak hurricane season is still ahead with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week raising its outlook for storms due in part to record warm sea surface temperatures. Hurricanes can result in damage to or closures of U.S. oil refineries, particularly along the Gulf Coast.

Analysis: Country Garden undone by promise to bring 5-star life to China's hinterland,"The company logo of Chinese developer Country Garden is pictured at the Shanghai Country Garden Center in Shanghai, China August 9, 2023. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's financially beleaguered property developer Country Garden promised ""five-star living"" to the masses in less popular, smaller cities but focusing on those areas has come back to haunt it.

China's largest developer by sales value before this year, Country Garden's (2007.HK) debt crisis has raised fears that its contagion will spread through the already sputtering economy, the world's second-largest.

Smaller Chinese cities, whose revenues have already been deteriorating, could have a glut of unfinished homes, a social problem Beijing is trying to avoid.

In 2022, Country Garden made 62% of its sales in smaller, less well-known areas that include so-called tier-three and tier-four cities such as the northern city of Dezhou and Maoming in the south. More than three-quarters of its land reserve for future development was also held in these types of cities.

But as China's economy started slowing during and after its COVID-19 lockdowns, property sales in those areas has plummeted along with values of the homes themselves.

The average new home price in the 35 smallest cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics fell on a year-on-year basis for a 17th month in June.

Country Garden's sales in 2020 were 570.7 billion yuan ($78.22 billion), but that slipped to 357.5 billion yuan in 2022. Lower sales, coupled with tighter access to fresh funding in recent years worsened the cash squeeze.

""It needs at least 30 billion yuan ($4.12 billion) of sales a month to breakeven but they have been only 10 to 20 something billion yuan (a month) this year because sales in tier-three and fourth cities are very bad now,"" said Oscar Choi, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oscar and Partners Capital Limited.

HIGH VOLUME, LOW MARGIN

Country Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins. Much of its scale was achieved through acquiring large, low-cost parcels of land from local governments. The multi-purpose developments it built included hotels, shops, schools, and sometimes tech parks.

In March, Country Garden Chairperson Yang Huiyan announced the firm would reduce its presence in smaller cities, after reporting a 90% drop in core profit for 2022 and a record net loss of 6.1 billion yuan. But that has seemingly come too late.

With 3,121 projects spread across all of China's provinces, the macro context of Country Garden's financial problems could be more precarious than China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), which has only around 800 projects, Oxford Economics said in a report.

Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura.

The real estate sector contributes the bulk of revenues to local governments through property taxes and land sales. In 2022, taxes provided 6.9% of local government revenues with 23.9% from sales, for a total of 30.8%, according to a report from Lu Ting, Chief China economist at Nomura.

Land sales revenues in the first half of 2023 were only 50% of those in the same period of 2021, with smaller cities more affected since they are more dependent on land sales, the bank said.

""Moreover, as housing demand in lower-tier cities deteriorates, it is likely to create a negative feedback loop that will further worsen the already deteriorating fiscal conditions,"" Nomura said.

The contagion fears over Country Garden's debt crisis is piling pressure on Beijing to step in, analysts said.

""Property and related sectors remain an important part of (gross domestic product), and their continued decline pulls down economic activity, as well as local government finances,"" said Gerwin Bell, PGIM Fixed Income's Lead Economist for Asia.

""Arresting the adverse spillovers from property will require significantly larger fiscal stimulus than the authorities have so far entertained.""

Summary US crude stockpiles fall by nearly 6 million barrels - EIA

Minutes of Fed meeting due at 1800 GMT

Concerns on China's economy remain key price driver

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Wednesday despite a large drawdown in U.S. crude oil stocks as investors weighed worries about China's embattled economy against expectations of tighter supply in the United States.

Brent crude futures edged up 6 cents to $84.95 a barrel by 11:35 a.m. EDT (1535 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 2 cents higher to $80.97 a barrel.

Both benchmarks fell more than 1% in the previous session to their lowest since Aug. 8.

U.S. crude oil inventories fell by nearly 6 million barrels last week on strong exports and refining run rates, despite crude production rising to its highest since the coronavirus pandemic decimated fuel consumption, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday.

However, product supplied of gasoline fell by 451,000 barrels per day in the week as peak driving season draws to a close.

""We're still seeing a subpar gasoline number...it looks like we're past peak summer travel season for many,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

China's sluggish economy has remained in focus, after retail sales, industrial output and investment figures failed to match expectations, fuelling concern over a deeper, longer-lasting slowdown.

July activity figures have prompted concerns that China may struggle to meet its growth target of about 5% for the year without more fiscal stimulus, and calls for authorities to take decisive steps.

Without giving details, a cabinet meeting chaired on Wednesday by Premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies aimed at boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Both the OPEC+ group, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are banking on China - the world's biggest oil importer - to galvanise crude demand over the rest of 2023.

Whilst dismal Chinese economic indicators have been causing headaches, providing a justified excuse for investors to go on the defensive, the global oil balance shows no signs of loosening up, PVM analyst Tamas Varga said, citing the latest numbers on U.S. crude inventories.

Investors will also have eyes on minutes from the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting for further cues on interest rate strategy at the world's biggest oil consumer.

The outlook in the fourth quarter will ""depend on the macroeconomic situation in China primarily, albeit it looks like Saudi will continue to address that via their cuts, if needed"", said Rystad Energy's research director Claudio Galimberti.

Supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia have pushed up oil prices over the past seven weeks. Figures published on Wednesday showed that Riyadh's crude exports fell to their lowest since September 2021.

Maui's displaced grow anxious as wildfire recovery drags on,"LAHAINA, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A week after wildfire ravaged the resort town of Lahaina, traumatized Maui residents have grown weary from living off relief supplies while many are kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news about their missing loved one.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Kiet Ma, a 56-year-old taxi driver who lost his home, said he found the local disaster response disorganized.

""The police, everyone, first responders, they're all rushing in but not enough manpower, and it's chaos,"" Ma said from his in-laws' home on the outskirts of Lahaina, where he is staying indefinitely.

Even as donations have poured in and Hawaii and federal officials have promised vast resources to aid in the recovery, Kanamu Balinbin, a local football coach, took matters into his own hands, setting up a relief camp where people who lost their homes and belongings could find water and food.

""I was devastated. I consider myself a strong leader, but it broke me,"" Balinbin said about his emotions after witnessing the destruction. ""This is what keeps me going, helping people. A lot of us are at that stage.""

He said some of the local frustration stemmed from the longstanding perception that Maui does not receive enough attention from the state government despite its robust tourism revenues.

Mary Kerstulovich, a Maui real estate agent who has sought supplies and housing for evacuees, said there was finally a sense government relief was arriving a full week after the disaster, but she said Lahaina still needed a more effective plan to obtain goods.

""There is still a lot of chaos. People need supplies still,"" Kerstulovich said.

Keith Turi, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's deputy associate administrator for response and recovery, acknowledged the deep sense of loss felt by survivors, but said FEMA had a warehouse of supplies in Hawaii and was working with state and county officials to supply shelters and relief operations.

""In the days immediately after something like this, there's a range of frustrations and challenges. But we feel like that in coordination with our partners that we are well positioned to be providing that support,"" Turi told reporters.

The fire destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.

Adding to the local frustration, few residents have been permitted back into Lahaina to visit their properties. Hawaii Governor Josh Green announced Tuesday night that Lahaina residents and employees would be allowed onto a highway leading to town. A previous relaxation of the road closure was soon halted after curiosity seekers clogged streets being used by rescue workers.

Meanwhile, up to 20 cadaver dogs have led search teams on a block-by-block search of the ashes, covering 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Green said in a televised address.

Bar chart shows visitor spending share of GDP to Maui and Hawaii which are much higher than that for the entire U.S.

President Joe Biden has said he would like to visit Maui as soon as possible, which Green said would be ""in the coming weeks"" to avoid disrupting recovery efforts.

""He did not want to interfere with the incredibly difficult emotional, physical work that goes on in a disaster zone,"" Green said after speaking with the president.

Only three of the deceased had been officially identified as of Monday, police said, but stories about those who perished have begun to emerge from friends and relatives.

On the fundraising website GoFundMe, relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home on Thursday morning.

""Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family,"" the post said, noting that the Tanakas have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.

Another post described how Joe Schilling - ""Uncle Joe"" to his adopted family, the Bluhs - died while helping five elderly people escape from his housing complex.

""He was known as 'Funcle Joe' for a reason,"" Akiva Bluh wrote. ""Whether it be the trips to go bullet-shell hunting or staying up late while my parents were gone so he could sneak us his famous sugar toast, he was always willing to act out of love and kindness towards myself and my brothers.""

Companies Eurostat Follow

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2023, even as the bloc's economy grew slightly, statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.

The EU's emissions over the January to March quarter amounted to 941 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, down 2.9% from a year earlier, while the economy grew 1.2% year-on-year.

As the world grapples with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather from climate change, including heatwaves in Portugal and Spain, the EU is pushing towards its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year it banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.

Emissions fell in 21 of the bloc's 27 countries, with the largest decreases seen in Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovenia. They grew however in Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Households were responsible for the biggest share - nearly a quarter - of total greenhouse gas emissions, Eurostat said, while manufacturing accounted for a fifth.

Electricity and gas supply - the sector where emissions fell the most - still contributed 19% to the total figure, with agriculture accounting for 13% and transportation and storage responsible for 10%.

Spain's acting PM Sanchez says he will seek investiture vote,"Spain's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sanchez attends a campaign closing rally ahead of the general election, in Getafe, Spain July 21, 2023 REUTERS/Violeta Santos Moura/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MADRID, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he intended to seek the support of the lower house to form a new government after an inconclusive election on July 23.

""I will ask for parliament's confidence to form a progressive government,"" Sanchez said in a address to the legislators of his Socialist Party (PSOE).

He said his party, which won the second-highest number of seats in the general election held last month, will first seek to clinch the lower house speaker position on Thursday.

Spain's election in July produced no outright winner, with the conservative People's Party (PP) gaining the most seats but falling short of a majority. Both the PP and PSOE have since begun negotiating with smaller parties to court their votes in parliament to form a government.

Sanchez, who first took power in 2018, has ruled since early 2020 thanks to a minority coalition with the far-left Podemos party.

He did not say on Wednesday who his coalition partners would be, but has previously said he intends to ally with far-left alliance, Sumar that includes Podemos.

Sanchez's PSOE, which together with Sumar has 152 seats, will need the 14 parliamentary votes of Catalan separatist parties Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) and the more hardline Junts to win an investiture vote in the 350-seat parliament.

While the ERC has indicated a willingness to reach an accord, Junts has stuck to its demands of permission to hold a referendum on Catalan independence and an amnesty for all separatists facing legal charges related to the region's 2017 failed independence bid. This includes its exiled leader Carles Puigdemont, who Spanish authorities are seeking to extradite from Belgium.

In a nod to the separatists, the Socialists have proposed Francina Armengol as speaker of the lower house. Armengol was regional president of the Balearic Islands from 2015-2023, where she governed in coalition with nationalist parties including the local version of ERC.

Junts has not yet indicated whether it will back Armengol's candidacy on Thursday.

The conservative People's Party won more seats than the Socialists, but did not secure an outright majority and faces an uphill battle as it so far lacks enough support to form a government.

It has so far failed to persuade the centre-right Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to support its investiture even after the hard-right Vox attempted to clear the way for other parties to back the PP by hinting that it would not insist on being part of a right-wing coalition.

The PNV and Coalicion Canaria, which has one seat, had previously said they would not back a government that included the first far-right party since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

"Americans back tariffs, military prep against China -Reuters/Ipsos poll","A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Bipartisan majorities of Americans favor more tariffs on Chinese goods and believe that the United States needs to step up preparations for military threats from the country, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos survey.

The two-day poll, which concluded on Tuesday, revealed deep worries among Americans about China's global influence at a time when U.S.-China relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades.

Some 66% of respondents said they were more likely to back a candidate in the 2024 presidential election who ""supports additional tariffs on Chinese imports.""

Another 66% of respondents - including 58% of Democrats and 81% of Republicans - agreed with a statement that the United States ""needs to do more to prepare for military threats from China.""

Still, just 38% of Americans supported the possible deployment of U.S. troops to defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, showing the political constraints facing any president seeking U.S. military involvement in a conflict involving China.

The bipartisan concern about China helps explain the increasingly combative stances Republican presidential candidates have taken toward the world's second-largest economy.

In recent months, Republican White House hopefuls have attacked China daily, with each candidate trying to show voters that they are best positioned to take on America's geopolitical foe.

Former President Donald Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have all called for the United States to end permanent normal trade relations with China, which would limit economic ties between the countries.

Biden has sought to stabilize the intense U.S.-China rivalry through high-level official engagement. But at recent fundraising events the president has called its economy a ""ticking time bomb"" and referred to its leader Xi Jinping a dictator.

DEFENDING TAIWAN?

The online Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted nationwide, collecting responses from 1,005 adults, including 443 Democrats and 346 Republicans. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points in either direction.

Seventy-five percent of Americans had a negative view toward China, while 84% saw Xi at least slightly unfavorably. Some 65% felt China's government was trying to influence the U.S. election.

While half of respondents supported aiding Taiwan with military equipment to deter a possible Chinese attack, 42% opposed deploying U.S. troops in Taiwan's defense, and 20% said they didn't know.

Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by China as its territory, is the main flashpoint in U.S. ties with China's Communist government.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns has said that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of Taiwan by 2027, though that does not necessarily mean he will go ahead with it.

Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its rule.

Biden said in 2022 that U.S forces would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, appearing to go beyond the long-standing U.S. approach of ""strategic ambiguity"" - not making clear whether it would respond militarily to such an attack.

But his administration has routinely said there has been no change to U.S. policy toward Taiwan.

HYDERABAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India's Amara Raja Batteries (AMAR.NS) plans to expand into the two-wheeler electric vehicle (EV) market, first through chargers and then batteries, as part of an expansion to triple its lithium-ion business this financial year, a top executive said.

Amara Raja, which currently has customers only in the three-wheeler EV market, gets about 2.5% of its revenue from its lithium-ion battery business, while the rest of its total revenue of 103.85 billion rupees ($1.25 billion) in fiscal 2023 was from its flagship lead acid storage battery-making unit.

The company, which owns the Amaron battery brand, aims to penetrate into two-wheeler EV market first with chargers and eventually through battery packs as it expands its so-called 'new energy' segment.

""This year, we're looking to grow very aggressively, that is almost going to be three times of last year,"" Executive Director Vikramadithya Gourineni said in an interview with Reuters last week.

It is also banking on its upcoming lithium cell and battery pack manufacturing units, one of India's largest, to increase production by the first quarter of the next financial year.

""We're talking to people for cell technology, chemistry development; we're even working with Indian players for raw materials,"" he said, highlighting how demand from the telecom sector is growing.

Amara Raja is also in talks with global companies to explore opportunities for ""technology transfer"" tied to lithium-ion battery manufacturing, sources told Reuters. However, Gourineni declined to provide more details.

The company has customers across the automotive, telecom and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) sectors.

Its lead acid battery arm will focus on expanding in the West and the company is in talks with eight ""large"" distributors in North America for a strategic supply partnership, Executive Director Harshavardhana Gourineni said.

""These distributors have their own brands and we're looking to offer our products. Some of these partnerships will materialise in this financial year,"" he said.

Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. motorists hoping to squeeze out one last trip before the Labor Day holiday and school begins are finding pump prices that have surged to their highest level this year on tighter gasoline supplies.

Consumers tend to get a break from steeper fuel costs as peak vacation travel ebbs. But strong demand and a series of refinery outages have pushed the national average retail price to $3.86 per gallon on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association - 7% higher than a month ago. In California and Washington, prices have surged above $5 a gallon.

National retail gasoline prices will average $3.90 a gallon this month, predict analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Martin Jones, a vacationer from Massachusetts, filled up his Toyota Corolla during a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Jones said he was relieved prices were not close to the $5 a gallon level of last summer.

""Or I won't be able to make long drives like this as easily,"" Jones said.

Retail prices in the U.S. Midwest jumped as much as 21 cents a gallon in Ohio and 16 cents in Michigan in the last week on earlier-than-expected maintenance at a BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.

Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.

China's sluggish economy has remained in focus, after retail sales, industrial output and investment figures failed to match expectations, fuelling concern over a deeper, longer-lasting slowdown.

July activity figures have prompted concerns that China may struggle to meet its growth target of about 5% for the year without more fiscal stimulus, and calls for authorities to take decisive steps.

Without giving details, a cabinet meeting chaired on Wednesday by Premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies aimed at boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Both the OPEC+ group, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are banking on China - the world's biggest oil importer - to galvanise crude demand over the rest of 2023.

Whilst dismal Chinese economic indicators have been causing headaches, providing a justified excuse for investors to go on the defensive, the global oil balance shows no signs of loosening up, PVM analyst Tamas Varga said, citing the latest numbers on U.S. crude inventories.

Investors will also have eyes on minutes from the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting for further cues on interest rate strategy at the world's biggest oil consumer.

The outlook in the fourth quarter will ""depend on the macroeconomic situation in China primarily, albeit it looks like Saudi will continue to address that via their cuts, if needed"", said Rystad Energy's research director Claudio Galimberti.

Supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia have pushed up oil prices over the past seven weeks. Figures published on Wednesday showed that Riyadh's crude exports fell to their lowest since September 2021.

Maui's displaced grow anxious as wildfire recovery drags on,"LAHAINA, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A week after wildfire ravaged the resort town of Lahaina, traumatized Maui residents have grown weary from living off relief supplies while many are kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news about their missing loved one.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Kiet Ma, a 56-year-old taxi driver who lost his home, said he found the local disaster response disorganized.

""The police, everyone, first responders, they're all rushing in but not enough manpower, and it's chaos,"" Ma said from his in-laws' home on the outskirts of Lahaina, where he is staying indefinitely.

Even as donations have poured in and Hawaii and federal officials have promised vast resources to aid in the recovery, Kanamu Balinbin, a local football coach, took matters into his own hands, setting up a relief camp where people who lost their homes and belongings could find water and food.

""I was devastated. I consider myself a strong leader, but it broke me,"" Balinbin said about his emotions after witnessing the destruction. ""This is what keeps me going, helping people. A lot of us are at that stage.""

He said some of the local frustration stemmed from the longstanding perception that Maui does not receive enough attention from the state government despite its robust tourism revenues.

Mary Kerstulovich, a Maui real estate agent who has sought supplies and housing for evacuees, said there was finally a sense government relief was arriving a full week after the disaster, but she said Lahaina still needed a more effective plan to obtain goods.

""There is still a lot of chaos. People need supplies still,"" Kerstulovich said.

""In the days immediately after something like this, there's a range of frustrations and challenges. But we feel like that in coordination with our partners that we are well positioned to be providing that support,"" Turi told reporters.

The fire destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.

Adding to the local frustration, few residents have been permitted back into Lahaina to visit their properties. Hawaii Governor Josh Green announced Tuesday night that Lahaina residents and employees would be allowed onto a highway leading to town. A previous relaxation of the road closure was soon halted after curiosity seekers clogged streets being used by rescue workers.

Meanwhile, up to 20 cadaver dogs have led search teams on a block-by-block search of the ashes, covering 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Green said in a televised address.

Only three of the deceased had been officially identified as of Monday, police said, but stories about those who perished have begun to emerge from friends and relatives.

On the fundraising website GoFundMe, relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home on Thursday morning.

""Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family,"" the post said, noting that the Tanakas have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2023, even as the bloc's economy grew slightly, statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.

The EU's emissions over the January to March quarter amounted to 941 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, down 2.9% from a year earlier, while the economy grew 1.2% year-on-year.

As the world grapples with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather from climate change, including heatwaves in Portugal and Spain, the EU is pushing towards its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year it banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.

Emissions fell in 21 of the bloc's 27 countries, with the largest decreases seen in Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovenia. They grew however in Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Households were responsible for the biggest share - nearly a quarter - of total greenhouse gas emissions, Eurostat said, while manufacturing accounted for a fifth.

Electricity and gas supply - the sector where emissions fell the most - still contributed 19% to the total figure, with agriculture accounting for 13% and transportation and storage responsible for 10%.

Spain's acting PM Sanchez says he will seek investiture vote,"Spain's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sanchez attends a campaign closing rally ahead of the general election, in Getafe, Spain July 21, 2023 REUTERS/Violeta Santos Moura/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MADRID, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he intended to seek the support of the lower house to form a new government after an inconclusive election on July 23.

""I will ask for parliament's confidence to form a progressive government,"" Sanchez said in a address to the legislators of his Socialist Party (PSOE).

He said his party, which won the second-highest number of seats in the general election held last month, will first seek to clinch the lower house speaker position on Thursday.

Spain's election in July produced no outright winner, with the conservative People's Party (PP) gaining the most seats but falling short of a majority. Both the PP and PSOE have since begun negotiating with smaller parties to court their votes in parliament to form a government.

Sanchez, who first took power in 2018, has ruled since early 2020 thanks to a minority coalition with the far-left Podemos party.

He did not say on Wednesday who his coalition partners would be, but has previously said he intends to ally with far-left alliance, Sumar that includes Podemos.

Sanchez's PSOE, which together with Sumar has 152 seats, will need the 14 parliamentary votes of Catalan separatist parties Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) and the more hardline Junts to win an investiture vote in the 350-seat parliament.

While the ERC has indicated a willingness to reach an accord, Junts has stuck to its demands of permission to hold a referendum on Catalan independence and an amnesty for all separatists facing legal charges related to the region's 2017 failed independence bid. This includes its exiled leader Carles Puigdemont, who Spanish authorities are seeking to extradite from Belgium.

In a nod to the separatists, the Socialists have proposed Francina Armengol as speaker of the lower house. Armengol was regional president of the Balearic Islands from 2015-2023, where she governed in coalition with nationalist parties including the local version of ERC.

Junts has not yet indicated whether it will back Armengol's candidacy on Thursday.

The conservative People's Party won more seats than the Socialists, but did not secure an outright majority and faces an uphill battle as it so far lacks enough support to form a government.

It has so far failed to persuade the centre-right Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to support its investiture even after the hard-right Vox attempted to clear the way for other parties to back the PP by hinting that it would not insist on being part of a right-wing coalition.

The PNV and Coalicion Canaria, which has one seat, had previously said they would not back a government that included the first far-right party since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

Highly trained dogs take on mission of finding Hawaii fire victims,"Members of FEMA Urban Search and Rescue teams Washington Task Force 1 and Nevada Task Force 1 continue searching through destroyed neighborhoods in the Maui city of Lahaina, Hawaii, U.S. August 13, 2023. Dominick Del Vecchio/FEMA/Handout via REUTERS. Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - A year of intense training to discern the difference between human and animal remains is a must for the specialized search dogs deployed to work on Maui following last week's deadly wildfires.

But it also takes a dog born with the particular personality needed for the job to find remains of the missing and help bring closure for anguished families, said Mary Cablk, an expert in detection and systems at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada, who has trained hundreds of canines, designed training programs for handlers and still goes out on dozens of searches a year with her own dogs.

""Dogs that really want to play, that are obsessive about their toy, that are confident and agile, that are not afraid of loud noises or weird surfaces, bring a lot to the table,"" she said. Cablk is not involved in the Maui recovery operation.

The wildfires that ravaged Maui last week killed at least 101 people, officials say, making it the deadliest U.S. fire in a century.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) urban search rescue teams had 20 dogs on the ground as of Monday supporting state and local officials combing through the ashes.

Jeremy Greenberg, FEMA's director of operations, said on a call with reporters on Monday that the treacherous conditions on Maui meant that the search is difficult.

Greenberg underscored that while searchers understand that families are desperate to know the fate of missing loved ones, they must ""conduct that search in a safe and respectful manner.""

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Each cadaver dog, which can undergo a year of intense lessons before being ready for missions, can search up to a couple dozen homes' burned down ""footprints"" each day. That number varies depending on conditions.

Hawaii's government has said that at least 2,200 structures were destroyed in the fires, 86% of which were residential buildings.

Dogs that will work fire scenes are trained to detect burnt flesh - and can distinguish human remains from those of pets and other animals. In the aftermath of a fire, the dogs are taught not to become excited and run back and forth from remains they have found to a handler, which could damage a scene. Cadaver dogs working fires will simply lay down once they have found something, Cablk said.

Dogs are also now being trained not to enter the ""footprint"" of a burned down house at all, but to signal to handlers that they have hit upon remains without approaching them.

That training came from lessons learned in deadly wildfires in California in recent years, such as the Paradise, California Camp Fire in which 86 were killed.

""It used to be that people would just go in and they would look, they would rake, they would shovel, and it made the job of the forensic anthropologists more difficult.

""You ended up with remains that were more difficult to identify. And where you had multiple individuals together, those bones got commingled, making the job of investigators even more difficult,"" Cablk said.

Just as teaching hospitals to use cadavers to teach medical students, Cablk said, trainers use human flesh and blood to train dogs. Some countries don't allow human remains in such training, and in those places dogs are taught using animal remains, making rescues more difficult.

Cadaver dogs are trained to associate the scent of human remains with a reward, typically a chew toy, Cablk said. If the dog successfully locates remains, it gets to play with the toy.

""That's the dog's paycheck,"" Cablk said. ""Handlers will carry the reward toy with them, and many dogs, in fact, will come around to the back of the handler and check to make sure that the toy is in their pack.""

India's Amara Raja Batteries to expand into two-wheeler market to power growth,"A model poses with an EV motorcycle of Matter Motorworks at a pavilion of the India Auto Show 2023 in Greater Noida, India, January 11, 2023. REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

HYDERABAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India's Amara Raja Batteries (AMAR.NS) plans to expand into the two-wheeler electric vehicle (EV) market, first through chargers and then batteries, as part of an expansion to triple its lithium-ion business this financial year, a top executive said.

Amara Raja, which currently has customers only in the three-wheeler EV market, gets about 2.5% of its revenue from its lithium-ion battery business, while the rest of its total revenue of 103.85 billion rupees ($1.25 billion) in fiscal 2023 was from its flagship lead acid storage battery-making unit.

The company, which owns the Amaron battery brand, aims to penetrate into two-wheeler EV market first with chargers and eventually through battery packs as it expands its so-called 'new energy' segment.

""This year, we're looking to grow very aggressively, that is almost going to be three times of last year,"" Executive Director Vikramadithya Gourineni said in an interview with Reuters last week.

It is also banking on its upcoming lithium cell and battery pack manufacturing units, one of India's largest, to increase production by the first quarter of the next financial year.

""We're talking to people for cell technology, chemistry development; we're even working with Indian players for raw materials,"" he said, highlighting how demand from the telecom sector is growing.

Amara Raja is also in talks with global companies to explore opportunities for ""technology transfer"" tied to lithium-ion battery manufacturing, sources told Reuters. However, Gourineni declined to provide more details.

The company has customers across the automotive, telecom and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) sectors.

Its lead acid battery arm will focus on expanding in the West and the company is in talks with eight ""large"" distributors in North America for a strategic supply partnership, Executive Director Harshavardhana Gourineni said.

""These distributors have their own brands and we're looking to offer our products. Some of these partnerships will materialise in this financial year,"" he said.

Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. motorists hoping to squeeze out one last trip before the Labor Day holiday and school begins are finding pump prices that have surged to their highest level this year on tighter gasoline supplies.

Consumers tend to get a break from steeper fuel costs as peak vacation travel ebbs. But strong demand and a series of refinery outages have pushed the national average retail price to $3.86 per gallon on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association - 7% higher than a month ago. In California and Washington, prices have surged above $5 a gallon.

National retail gasoline prices will average $3.90 a gallon this month, predict analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Martin Jones, a vacationer from Massachusetts, filled up his Toyota Corolla during a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Jones said he was relieved prices were not close to the $5 a gallon level of last summer.

""Or I won't be able to make long drives like this as easily,"" Jones said.

Retail prices in the U.S. Midwest jumped as much as 21 cents a gallon in Ohio and 16 cents in Michigan in the last week on earlier-than-expected maintenance at a BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.

Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.

BELOW-AVERAGE STOCKS

""It is fairly abnormal to see prices going up"" at this time of the year, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.com. ""We tend to see prices declining going into the fall.""

Weekly U.S. gasoline stockpiles have remained below the five-year average of inventories throughout this year, setting the stage for price spikes if refining capacity is disrupted. Total U.S. gasoline stocks this month fell to 216.4 million barrels, the fifth decline in six weeks, according to U.S. government data.

At the same time, record heat levels in Texas have likely led to a sharp 2% slump in U.S. refiners' product yields over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs noted on Sunday. Small changes to the yield often add up to a meaningful decline in product availability, the bank added.

Peak hurricane season is still ahead with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week raising its outlook for storms due in part to record warm sea surface temperatures. Hurricanes can result in damage to or closures of U.S. oil refineries, particularly along the Gulf Coast.

Analysis: Country Garden undone by promise to bring 5-star life to China's hinterland,"The company logo of Chinese developer Country Garden is pictured at the Shanghai Country Garden Center in Shanghai, China August 9, 2023. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's financially beleaguered property developer Country Garden promised ""five-star living"" to the masses in less popular, smaller cities but focusing on those areas has come back to haunt it.

China's largest developer by sales value before this year, Country Garden's (2007.HK) debt crisis has raised fears that its contagion will spread through the already sputtering economy, the world's second-largest.

Smaller Chinese cities, whose revenues have already been deteriorating, could have a glut of unfinished homes, a social problem Beijing is trying to avoid.

In 2022, Country Garden made 62% of its sales in smaller, less well-known areas that include so-called tier-three and tier-four cities such as the northern city of Dezhou and Maoming in the south. More than three-quarters of its land reserve for future development was also held in these types of cities.

But as China's economy started slowing during and after its COVID-19 lockdowns, property sales in those areas has plummeted along with values of the homes themselves.

The average new home price in the 35 smallest cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics fell on a year-on-year basis for a 17th month in June.

Country Garden's sales in 2020 were 570.7 billion yuan ($78.22 billion), but that slipped to 357.5 billion yuan in 2022. Lower sales, coupled with tighter access to fresh funding in recent years worsened the cash squeeze.

""It needs at least 30 billion yuan ($4.12 billion) of sales a month to breakeven but they have been only 10 to 20 something billion yuan (a month) this year because sales in tier-three and fourth cities are very bad now,"" said Oscar Choi, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oscar and Partners Capital Limited.

HIGH VOLUME, LOW MARGIN

Country Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins. Much of its scale was achieved through acquiring large, low-cost parcels of land from local governments. The multi-purpose developments it built included hotels, shops, schools, and sometimes tech parks.

In March, Country Garden Chairperson Yang Huiyan announced the firm would reduce its presence in smaller cities, after reporting a 90% drop in core profit for 2022 and a record net loss of 6.1 billion yuan. But that has seemingly come too late.

With 3,121 projects spread across all of China's provinces, the macro context of Country Garden's financial problems could be more precarious than China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), which has only around 800 projects, Oxford Economics said in a report.

Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura.

The real estate sector contributes the bulk of revenues to local governments through property taxes and land sales. In 2022, taxes provided 6.9% of local government revenues with 23.9% from sales, for a total of 30.8%, according to a report from Lu Ting, Chief China economist at Nomura.

Land sales revenues in the first half of 2023 were only 50% of those in the same period of 2021, with smaller cities more affected since they are more dependent on land sales, the bank said.

""Moreover, as housing demand in lower-tier cities deteriorates, it is likely to create a negative feedback loop that will further worsen the already deteriorating fiscal conditions,"" Nomura said.

The contagion fears over Country Garden's debt crisis is piling pressure on Beijing to step in, analysts said.

""Property and related sectors remain an important part of (gross domestic product), and their continued decline pulls down economic activity, as well as local government finances,"" said Gerwin Bell, PGIM Fixed Income's Lead Economist for Asia.

""Arresting the adverse spillovers from property will require significantly larger fiscal stimulus than the authorities have so far entertained.""

Minutes of Fed meeting due at 1800 GMT

Concerns on China's economy remain key price driver

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Wednesday despite a large drawdown in U.S. crude oil stocks as investors weighed worries about China's embattled economy against expectations of tighter supply in the United States.

Brent crude futures edged up 6 cents to $84.95 a barrel by 11:35 a.m. EDT (1535 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 2 cents higher to $80.97 a barrel.

Both benchmarks fell more than 1% in the previous session to their lowest since Aug. 8.

U.S. crude oil inventories fell by nearly 6 million barrels last week on strong exports and refining run rates, despite crude production rising to its highest since the coronavirus pandemic decimated fuel consumption, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday.

However, product supplied of gasoline fell by 451,000 barrels per day in the week as peak driving season draws to a close.

As the world grapples with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather from climate change, including heatwaves in Portugal and Spain, the EU is pushing towards its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year it banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.

Emissions fell in 21 of the bloc's 27 countries, with the largest decreases seen in Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovenia. They grew however in Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Households were responsible for the biggest share - nearly a quarter - of total greenhouse gas emissions, Eurostat said, while manufacturing accounted for a fifth.

Electricity and gas supply - the sector where emissions fell the most - still contributed 19% to the total figure, with agriculture accounting for 13% and transportation and storage responsible for 10%.

Spain's acting PM Sanchez says he will seek investiture vote,"Spain's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sanchez attends a campaign closing rally ahead of the general election, in Getafe, Spain July 21, 2023 REUTERS/Violeta Santos Moura/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MADRID, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he intended to seek the support of the lower house to form a new government after an inconclusive election on July 23.

""I will ask for parliament's confidence to form a progressive government,"" Sanchez said in a address to the legislators of his Socialist Party (PSOE).

He said his party, which won the second-highest number of seats in the general election held last month, will first seek to clinch the lower house speaker position on Thursday.

Spain's election in July produced no outright winner, with the conservative People's Party (PP) gaining the most seats but falling short of a majority. Both the PP and PSOE have since begun negotiating with smaller parties to court their votes in parliament to form a government.

Sanchez, who first took power in 2018, has ruled since early 2020 thanks to a minority coalition with the far-left Podemos party.

He did not say on Wednesday who his coalition partners would be, but has previously said he intends to ally with far-left alliance, Sumar that includes Podemos.

Sanchez's PSOE, which together with Sumar has 152 seats, will need the 14 parliamentary votes of Catalan separatist parties Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) and the more hardline Junts to win an investiture vote in the 350-seat parliament.

While the ERC has indicated a willingness to reach an accord, Junts has stuck to its demands of permission to hold a referendum on Catalan independence and an amnesty for all separatists facing legal charges related to the region's 2017 failed independence bid. This includes its exiled leader Carles Puigdemont, who Spanish authorities are seeking to extradite from Belgium.

In a nod to the separatists, the Socialists have proposed Francina Armengol as speaker of the lower house. Armengol was regional president of the Balearic Islands from 2015-2023, where she governed in coalition with nationalist parties including the local version of ERC.

Junts has not yet indicated whether it will back Armengol's candidacy on Thursday.

The conservative People's Party won more seats than the Socialists, but did not secure an outright majority and faces an uphill battle as it so far lacks enough support to form a government.

It has so far failed to persuade the centre-right Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to support its investiture even after the hard-right Vox attempted to clear the way for other parties to back the PP by hinting that it would not insist on being part of a right-wing coalition.

The PNV and Coalicion Canaria, which has one seat, had previously said they would not back a government that included the first far-right party since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

Highly trained dogs take on mission of finding Hawaii fire victims,"Members of FEMA Urban Search and Rescue teams Washington Task Force 1 and Nevada Task Force 1 continue searching through destroyed neighborhoods in the Maui city of Lahaina, Hawaii, U.S. August 13, 2023. Dominick Del Vecchio/FEMA/Handout via REUTERS. Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - A year of intense training to discern the difference between human and animal remains is a must for the specialized search dogs deployed to work on Maui following last week's deadly wildfires.

But it also takes a dog born with the particular personality needed for the job to find remains of the missing and help bring closure for anguished families, said Mary Cablk, an expert in detection and systems at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada, who has trained hundreds of canines, designed training programs for handlers and still goes out on dozens of searches a year with her own dogs.

""Dogs that really want to play, that are obsessive about their toy, that are confident and agile, that are not afraid of loud noises or weird surfaces, bring a lot to the table,"" she said. Cablk is not involved in the Maui recovery operation.

The wildfires that ravaged Maui last week killed at least 101 people, officials say, making it the deadliest U.S. fire in a century.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) urban search rescue teams had 20 dogs on the ground as of Monday supporting state and local officials combing through the ashes.

Jeremy Greenberg, FEMA's director of operations, said on a call with reporters on Monday that the treacherous conditions on Maui meant that the search is difficult.

Greenberg underscored that while searchers understand that families are desperate to know the fate of missing loved ones, they must ""conduct that search in a safe and respectful manner.""

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Each cadaver dog, which can undergo a year of intense lessons before being ready for missions, can search up to a couple dozen homes' burned down ""footprints"" each day. That number varies depending on conditions.

Hawaii's government has said that at least 2,200 structures were destroyed in the fires, 86% of which were residential buildings.

Dogs that will work fire scenes are trained to detect burnt flesh - and can distinguish human remains from those of pets and other animals. In the aftermath of a fire, the dogs are taught not to become excited and run back and forth from remains they have found to a handler, which could damage a scene. Cadaver dogs working fires will simply lay down once they have found something, Cablk said.

Dogs are also now being trained not to enter the ""footprint"" of a burned down house at all, but to signal to handlers that they have hit upon remains without approaching them.

That training came from lessons learned in deadly wildfires in California in recent years, such as the Paradise, California Camp Fire in which 86 were killed.

""It used to be that people would just go in and they would look, they would rake, they would shovel, and it made the job of the forensic anthropologists more difficult.

""You ended up with remains that were more difficult to identify. And where you had multiple individuals together, those bones got commingled, making the job of investigators even more difficult,"" Cablk said.

Just as teaching hospitals to use cadavers to teach medical students, Cablk said, trainers use human flesh and blood to train dogs. Some countries don't allow human remains in such training, and in those places dogs are taught using animal remains, making rescues more difficult.

Cadaver dogs are trained to associate the scent of human remains with a reward, typically a chew toy, Cablk said. If the dog successfully locates remains, it gets to play with the toy.

""That's the dog's paycheck,"" Cablk said. ""Handlers will carry the reward toy with them, and many dogs, in fact, will come around to the back of the handler and check to make sure that the toy is in their pack.""

Nagorno-Karabakh residents say 'disastrous' blockade choking supplies,"Summary UN Security Council to discuss eight-month Karabakh blockade

Armenians may face genocide in Karabakh, says former ICC prosecutor

Azerbaijan says it needed to stop arms supplies from Armenia

TBILISI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month.

The U.N. Security Council will discuss the blockade on Wednesday, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor this month said the blockade may amount to a ""genocide"" of the local Armenian population - an assertion that Azerbaijan's lawyers said was unsubstantiated and inaccurate.

Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but its population of 120,000 is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian and the enclave's one remaining land link to Armenia, the Lachin corridor policed by Russian peacekeepers, was first disrupted in December.

Three residents of Karabakh said basic foodstuffs, fuel and medicine were almost exhausted.

""It's been a very long time since I've eaten any dairy produce, or eggs,"" Nina Shahverdyan, a 23-year-old English teacher, said in a video call with Reuters from the region's capital, which local Armenians call Stepanakert.

""It's been disastrous because we don't have gas. We have electricity blackouts.""

Armenia's foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan, discussed the situation in Karabakh on Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and stressed the need to avert a ""humanitarian disaster"" there, Russia's TASS state news agency reported.

Karabakh's population has tightened its belt since the blockade, eating only what can be produced locally.

The residents said even food produced within Karabakh itself is delivered only sporadically to Stepanakert, as farmers lack fuel to bring their products to market.

Ani Balayan, a recent high school graduate and photographer, said she had last eaten meat around two weeks ago. She said her family was surviving on bread, alongside the tomatoes, cucumbers and watermelon still available in Stepanakert's markets.

For some weeks, footage has shown Stepanakert's supermarket shelves bare, with little or nothing on sale.

""I went to bed hungry for several days because I could not find bread to bring home,"" Balayan said.

BREAKAWAY REGION

The crisis has highlighted how Russia, which is pre-occupied with the war in Ukraine, is struggling to project its influence in neighbouring post-Soviet states.

Karabakh was claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917, and broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the early 1990s.

In 2020, Azerbaijan retook territory in and around the enclave after a second war that ended in a Russia-brokered ceasefire. The agreement required Russia to ensure that road transport between Armenia and Karabakh remained open.

Since the ceasefire, road links between Armenia and Karabakh hinged on the Lachin corridor, which was blockaded in December by Azerbaijani civilians identifying themselves as ecological activists, while Russian peacekeepers did not intervene.

In April, Azerbaijani border guards installed a checkpoint on the route, tightening the blockade.

'GENOCIDE'?

This month, former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Luis Moreno Ocampo described the blockade as potentially constituting a ""genocide"" of Karabakh Armenians and intending ""to starve"" them.

Rodney Dixon, a lawyer appointed by Azerbaijan to give an assessment on Ocampo's opinion, called the view ""strikingly"" unsubstantiated, inflammatory and inaccurate.

Farhad Mammadov, the head of Baku's Centre for Studies of the South Caucasus think tank, said that controls on the road were necessary to prevent the transit of ""arms and Armenian soldiers"" to and from Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has said it is ready to open supplies to Karabakh via territory under its control, but that the separatist authorities must dissolve and integrate the region into Azerbaijan. The Armenian side has said that the blockade is aimed at forcing Karabakh into unconditional surrender to Baku.

English teacher Shahverdyan said: ""They are doing so that the people become… so desperate that they just simply leave"".

However, like other Karabakh Armenians who spoke to Reuters, Shahverdyan said it had only bolstered their determination to stay in their ancestral homeland.

""How can you live under a government or people who starve you for eight months?""

"US gasoline prices at year high, tight supply weighs on motorists","Consumers purchase gasoline at a gas station as a plane approaches to land at the airport in San Diego, California October 8, 2012. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. motorists hoping to squeeze out one last trip before the Labor Day holiday and school begins are finding pump prices that have surged to their highest level this year on tighter gasoline supplies.

Consumers tend to get a break from steeper fuel costs as peak vacation travel ebbs. But strong demand and a series of refinery outages have pushed the national average retail price to $3.86 per gallon on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association - 7% higher than a month ago. In California and Washington, prices have surged above $5 a gallon.

National retail gasoline prices will average $3.90 a gallon this month, predict analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Martin Jones, a vacationer from Massachusetts, filled up his Toyota Corolla during a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Jones said he was relieved prices were not close to the $5 a gallon level of last summer.

""Or I won't be able to make long drives like this as easily,"" Jones said.

Retail prices in the U.S. Midwest jumped as much as 21 cents a gallon in Ohio and 16 cents in Michigan in the last week on earlier-than-expected maintenance at a BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana.

Irving Oil's 320,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery in New Brunswick, Canada, and Delta's 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania, will be down for much of September and part of October, affecting about 9% of the product supplied in their regions.

BELOW-AVERAGE STOCKS

""It is fairly abnormal to see prices going up"" at this time of the year, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at price tracker GasBuddy.com. ""We tend to see prices declining going into the fall.""

Weekly U.S. gasoline stockpiles have remained below the five-year average of inventories throughout this year, setting the stage for price spikes if refining capacity is disrupted. Total U.S. gasoline stocks this month fell to 216.4 million barrels, the fifth decline in six weeks, according to U.S. government data.

At the same time, record heat levels in Texas have likely led to a sharp 2% slump in U.S. refiners' product yields over the past few weeks, Goldman Sachs noted on Sunday. Small changes to the yield often add up to a meaningful decline in product availability, the bank added.

Peak hurricane season is still ahead with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week raising its outlook for storms due in part to record warm sea surface temperatures. Hurricanes can result in damage to or closures of U.S. oil refineries, particularly along the Gulf Coast.

Analysis: Country Garden undone by promise to bring 5-star life to China's hinterland,"The company logo of Chinese developer Country Garden is pictured at the Shanghai Country Garden Center in Shanghai, China August 9, 2023. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's financially beleaguered property developer Country Garden promised ""five-star living"" to the masses in less popular, smaller cities but focusing on those areas has come back to haunt it.

China's largest developer by sales value before this year, Country Garden's (2007.HK) debt crisis has raised fears that its contagion will spread through the already sputtering economy, the world's second-largest.

Smaller Chinese cities, whose revenues have already been deteriorating, could have a glut of unfinished homes, a social problem Beijing is trying to avoid.

In 2022, Country Garden made 62% of its sales in smaller, less well-known areas that include so-called tier-three and tier-four cities such as the northern city of Dezhou and Maoming in the south. More than three-quarters of its land reserve for future development was also held in these types of cities.

But as China's economy started slowing during and after its COVID-19 lockdowns, property sales in those areas has plummeted along with values of the homes themselves.

The average new home price in the 35 smallest cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics fell on a year-on-year basis for a 17th month in June.

Country Garden's sales in 2020 were 570.7 billion yuan ($78.22 billion), but that slipped to 357.5 billion yuan in 2022. Lower sales, coupled with tighter access to fresh funding in recent years worsened the cash squeeze.

""It needs at least 30 billion yuan ($4.12 billion) of sales a month to breakeven but they have been only 10 to 20 something billion yuan (a month) this year because sales in tier-three and fourth cities are very bad now,"" said Oscar Choi, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oscar and Partners Capital Limited.

HIGH VOLUME, LOW MARGIN

Country Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins. Much of its scale was achieved through acquiring large, low-cost parcels of land from local governments. The multi-purpose developments it built included hotels, shops, schools, and sometimes tech parks.

In March, Country Garden Chairperson Yang Huiyan announced the firm would reduce its presence in smaller cities, after reporting a 90% drop in core profit for 2022 and a record net loss of 6.1 billion yuan. But that has seemingly come too late.

With 3,121 projects spread across all of China's provinces, the macro context of Country Garden's financial problems could be more precarious than China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), which has only around 800 projects, Oxford Economics said in a report.

Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura.

The real estate sector contributes the bulk of revenues to local governments through property taxes and land sales. In 2022, taxes provided 6.9% of local government revenues with 23.9% from sales, for a total of 30.8%, according to a report from Lu Ting, Chief China economist at Nomura.

Land sales revenues in the first half of 2023 were only 50% of those in the same period of 2021, with smaller cities more affected since they are more dependent on land sales, the bank said.

""Moreover, as housing demand in lower-tier cities deteriorates, it is likely to create a negative feedback loop that will further worsen the already deteriorating fiscal conditions,"" Nomura said.

The contagion fears over Country Garden's debt crisis is piling pressure on Beijing to step in, analysts said.

""Property and related sectors remain an important part of (gross domestic product), and their continued decline pulls down economic activity, as well as local government finances,"" said Gerwin Bell, PGIM Fixed Income's Lead Economist for Asia.

""Arresting the adverse spillovers from property will require significantly larger fiscal stimulus than the authorities have so far entertained.""

Summary US crude stockpiles fall by nearly 6 million barrels - EIA

Minutes of Fed meeting due at 1800 GMT

Concerns on China's economy remain key price driver

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Wednesday despite a large drawdown in U.S. crude oil stocks as investors weighed worries about China's embattled economy against expectations of tighter supply in the United States.

Brent crude futures edged up 6 cents to $84.95 a barrel by 11:35 a.m. EDT (1535 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 2 cents higher to $80.97 a barrel.

Both benchmarks fell more than 1% in the previous session to their lowest since Aug. 8.

U.S. crude oil inventories fell by nearly 6 million barrels last week on strong exports and refining run rates, despite crude production rising to its highest since the coronavirus pandemic decimated fuel consumption, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday.

However, product supplied of gasoline fell by 451,000 barrels per day in the week as peak driving season draws to a close.

""We're still seeing a subpar gasoline number...it looks like we're past peak summer travel season for many,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

China's sluggish economy has remained in focus, after retail sales, industrial output and investment figures failed to match expectations, fuelling concern over a deeper, longer-lasting slowdown.

July activity figures have prompted concerns that China may struggle to meet its growth target of about 5% for the year without more fiscal stimulus, and calls for authorities to take decisive steps.

Without giving details, a cabinet meeting chaired on Wednesday by Premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies aimed at boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Both the OPEC+ group, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are banking on China - the world's biggest oil importer - to galvanise crude demand over the rest of 2023.

Whilst dismal Chinese economic indicators have been causing headaches, providing a justified excuse for investors to go on the defensive, the global oil balance shows no signs of loosening up, PVM analyst Tamas Varga said, citing the latest numbers on U.S. crude inventories.

Investors will also have eyes on minutes from the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting for further cues on interest rate strategy at the world's biggest oil consumer.

The outlook in the fourth quarter will ""depend on the macroeconomic situation in China primarily, albeit it looks like Saudi will continue to address that via their cuts, if needed"", said Rystad Energy's research director Claudio Galimberti.

Supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia have pushed up oil prices over the past seven weeks. Figures published on Wednesday showed that Riyadh's crude exports fell to their lowest since September 2021.

Maui's displaced grow anxious as wildfire recovery drags on,"LAHAINA, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A week after wildfire ravaged the resort town of Lahaina, traumatized Maui residents have grown weary from living off relief supplies while many are kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news about their missing loved one.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Kiet Ma, a 56-year-old taxi driver who lost his home, said he found the local disaster response disorganized.

""The police, everyone, first responders, they're all rushing in but not enough manpower, and it's chaos,"" Ma said from his in-laws' home on the outskirts of Lahaina, where he is staying indefinitely.

Even as donations have poured in and Hawaii and federal officials have promised vast resources to aid in the recovery, Kanamu Balinbin, a local football coach, took matters into his own hands, setting up a relief camp where people who lost their homes and belongings could find water and food.

""I was devastated. I consider myself a strong leader, but it broke me,"" Balinbin said about his emotions after witnessing the destruction. ""This is what keeps me going, helping people. A lot of us are at that stage.""

He said some of the local frustration stemmed from the longstanding perception that Maui does not receive enough attention from the state government despite its robust tourism revenues.

Mary Kerstulovich, a Maui real estate agent who has sought supplies and housing for evacuees, said there was finally a sense government relief was arriving a full week after the disaster, but she said Lahaina still needed a more effective plan to obtain goods.

""There is still a lot of chaos. People need supplies still,"" Kerstulovich said.

Keith Turi, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's deputy associate administrator for response and recovery, acknowledged the deep sense of loss felt by survivors, but said FEMA had a warehouse of supplies in Hawaii and was working with state and county officials to supply shelters and relief operations.

""In the days immediately after something like this, there's a range of frustrations and challenges. But we feel like that in coordination with our partners that we are well positioned to be providing that support,"" Turi told reporters.

The fire destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.

Adding to the local frustration, few residents have been permitted back into Lahaina to visit their properties. Hawaii Governor Josh Green announced Tuesday night that Lahaina residents and employees would be allowed onto a highway leading to town. A previous relaxation of the road closure was soon halted after curiosity seekers clogged streets being used by rescue workers.

Meanwhile, up to 20 cadaver dogs have led search teams on a block-by-block search of the ashes, covering 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Green said in a televised address.

Bar chart shows visitor spending share of GDP to Maui and Hawaii which are much higher than that for the entire U.S.

President Joe Biden has said he would like to visit Maui as soon as possible, which Green said would be ""in the coming weeks"" to avoid disrupting recovery efforts.

""He did not want to interfere with the incredibly difficult emotional, physical work that goes on in a disaster zone,"" Green said after speaking with the president.

Only three of the deceased had been officially identified as of Monday, police said, but stories about those who perished have begun to emerge from friends and relatives.

On the fundraising website GoFundMe, relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home on Thursday morning.

""Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family,"" the post said, noting that the Tanakas have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.

Another post described how Joe Schilling - ""Uncle Joe"" to his adopted family, the Bluhs - died while helping five elderly people escape from his housing complex.

""He was known as 'Funcle Joe' for a reason,"" Akiva Bluh wrote. ""Whether it be the trips to go bullet-shell hunting or staying up late while my parents were gone so he could sneak us his famous sugar toast, he was always willing to act out of love and kindness towards myself and my brothers.""

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2023, even as the bloc's economy grew slightly, statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.

The EU's emissions over the January to March quarter amounted to 941 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, down 2.9% from a year earlier, while the economy grew 1.2% year-on-year.

As the world grapples with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather from climate change, including heatwaves in Portugal and Spain, the EU is pushing towards its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year it banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.

Emissions fell in 21 of the bloc's 27 countries, with the largest decreases seen in Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovenia. They grew however in Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Households were responsible for the biggest share - nearly a quarter - of total greenhouse gas emissions, Eurostat said, while manufacturing accounted for a fifth.

Electricity and gas supply - the sector where emissions fell the most - still contributed 19% to the total figure, with agriculture accounting for 13% and transportation and storage responsible for 10%.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) urban search rescue teams had 20 dogs on the ground as of Monday supporting state and local officials combing through the ashes.

Jeremy Greenberg, FEMA's director of operations, said on a call with reporters on Monday that the treacherous conditions on Maui meant that the search is difficult.

Greenberg underscored that while searchers understand that families are desperate to know the fate of missing loved ones, they must ""conduct that search in a safe and respectful manner.""

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Each cadaver dog, which can undergo a year of intense lessons before being ready for missions, can search up to a couple dozen homes' burned down ""footprints"" each day. That number varies depending on conditions.

Hawaii's government has said that at least 2,200 structures were destroyed in the fires, 86% of which were residential buildings.

Dogs that will work fire scenes are trained to detect burnt flesh - and can distinguish human remains from those of pets and other animals. In the aftermath of a fire, the dogs are taught not to become excited and run back and forth from remains they have found to a handler, which could damage a scene. Cadaver dogs working fires will simply lay down once they have found something, Cablk said.

Dogs are also now being trained not to enter the ""footprint"" of a burned down house at all, but to signal to handlers that they have hit upon remains without approaching them.

That training came from lessons learned in deadly wildfires in California in recent years, such as the Paradise, California Camp Fire in which 86 were killed.

""It used to be that people would just go in and they would look, they would rake, they would shovel, and it made the job of the forensic anthropologists more difficult.

""You ended up with remains that were more difficult to identify. And where you had multiple individuals together, those bones got commingled, making the job of investigators even more difficult,"" Cablk said.

Just as teaching hospitals to use cadavers to teach medical students, Cablk said, trainers use human flesh and blood to train dogs. Some countries don't allow human remains in such training, and in those places dogs are taught using animal remains, making rescues more difficult.

Cadaver dogs are trained to associate the scent of human remains with a reward, typically a chew toy, Cablk said. If the dog successfully locates remains, it gets to play with the toy.

""That's the dog's paycheck,"" Cablk said. ""Handlers will carry the reward toy with them, and many dogs, in fact, will come around to the back of the handler and check to make sure that the toy is in their pack.""

Nagorno-Karabakh residents say 'disastrous' blockade choking supplies,"Summary UN Security Council to discuss eight-month Karabakh blockade

Armenians may face genocide in Karabakh, says former ICC prosecutor

Azerbaijan says it needed to stop arms supplies from Armenia

TBILISI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month.

The U.N. Security Council will discuss the blockade on Wednesday, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor this month said the blockade may amount to a ""genocide"" of the local Armenian population - an assertion that Azerbaijan's lawyers said was unsubstantiated and inaccurate.

Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but its population of 120,000 is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian and the enclave's one remaining land link to Armenia, the Lachin corridor policed by Russian peacekeepers, was first disrupted in December.

Three residents of Karabakh said basic foodstuffs, fuel and medicine were almost exhausted.

""It's been a very long time since I've eaten any dairy produce, or eggs,"" Nina Shahverdyan, a 23-year-old English teacher, said in a video call with Reuters from the region's capital, which local Armenians call Stepanakert.

""It's been disastrous because we don't have gas. We have electricity blackouts.""

Armenia's foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan, discussed the situation in Karabakh on Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and stressed the need to avert a ""humanitarian disaster"" there, Russia's TASS state news agency reported.

Karabakh's population has tightened its belt since the blockade, eating only what can be produced locally.

The residents said even food produced within Karabakh itself is delivered only sporadically to Stepanakert, as farmers lack fuel to bring their products to market.

Ani Balayan, a recent high school graduate and photographer, said she had last eaten meat around two weeks ago. She said her family was surviving on bread, alongside the tomatoes, cucumbers and watermelon still available in Stepanakert's markets.

For some weeks, footage has shown Stepanakert's supermarket shelves bare, with little or nothing on sale.

""I went to bed hungry for several days because I could not find bread to bring home,"" Balayan said.

BREAKAWAY REGION

The crisis has highlighted how Russia, which is pre-occupied with the war in Ukraine, is struggling to project its influence in neighbouring post-Soviet states.

Karabakh was claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917, and broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the early 1990s.

In 2020, Azerbaijan retook territory in and around the enclave after a second war that ended in a Russia-brokered ceasefire. The agreement required Russia to ensure that road transport between Armenia and Karabakh remained open.

Since the ceasefire, road links between Armenia and Karabakh hinged on the Lachin corridor, which was blockaded in December by Azerbaijani civilians identifying themselves as ecological activists, while Russian peacekeepers did not intervene.

In April, Azerbaijani border guards installed a checkpoint on the route, tightening the blockade.

'GENOCIDE'?

This month, former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Luis Moreno Ocampo described the blockade as potentially constituting a ""genocide"" of Karabakh Armenians and intending ""to starve"" them.

Rodney Dixon, a lawyer appointed by Azerbaijan to give an assessment on Ocampo's opinion, called the view ""strikingly"" unsubstantiated, inflammatory and inaccurate.

Farhad Mammadov, the head of Baku's Centre for Studies of the South Caucasus think tank, said that controls on the road were necessary to prevent the transit of ""arms and Armenian soldiers"" to and from Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has said it is ready to open supplies to Karabakh via territory under its control, but that the separatist authorities must dissolve and integrate the region into Azerbaijan. The Armenian side has said that the blockade is aimed at forcing Karabakh into unconditional surrender to Baku.

English teacher Shahverdyan said: ""They are doing so that the people become… so desperate that they just simply leave"".

However, like other Karabakh Armenians who spoke to Reuters, Shahverdyan said it had only bolstered their determination to stay in their ancestral homeland.

""How can you live under a government or people who starve you for eight months?""

China's fertility rate drops to record low 1.09 in 2022- state media,"HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's fertility rate is estimated to have dropped to a record low of 1.09 in 2022, the National Business Daily said on Tuesday, a figure likely to rattle authorities as they try to boost the country's declining number of new births.

The state-backed Daily said the figure from China's Population and Development Research Center put it as having the lowest fertility level among countries with a population of more than 100 million.

China's fertility rate is already one of the world's lowest alongside South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Concerned about China's first population drop in six decades and its rapid ageing population, Beijing is urgently trying an array of measures to lift the birth rate including financial incentives and improved childcare facilities.

President Xi Jinping in May presided over a meeting to study the topic.

China has said it will focus on education, science and technology to improve population quality and strive to maintain a ""moderate fertility"" level to support economic growth in future.

High childcare costs and having to stop their careers have put many women off having more children or any at all. Gender discrimination and traditional stereotypes of women caring for their children are still widespread throughout the country. Authorities have in recent months increased rhetoric on sharing the duty of child rearing but paternity leave is still limited in most provinces.

Hong Kong's Family Planning Association said in a separate release on Tuesday that the number of childless women in the special Chinese administrative region more than doubled from five years ago to 43.2% last year.

The percentage of couples with one or two children also tumbled while the average number of children per woman dropped from 1.3 in 2017 to a record low of 0.9 last year, according to its survey.

Analysis: Country Garden undone by promise to bring 5-star life to China's hinterland,"The company logo of Chinese developer Country Garden is pictured at the Shanghai Country Garden Center in Shanghai, China August 9, 2023. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

HONG KONG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China's financially beleaguered property developer Country Garden promised ""five-star living"" to the masses in less popular, smaller cities but focusing on those areas has come back to haunt it.

China's largest developer by sales value before this year, Country Garden's (2007.HK) debt crisis has raised fears that its contagion will spread through the already sputtering economy, the world's second-largest.

Smaller Chinese cities, whose revenues have already been deteriorating, could have a glut of unfinished homes, a social problem Beijing is trying to avoid.

In 2022, Country Garden made 62% of its sales in smaller, less well-known areas that include so-called tier-three and tier-four cities such as the northern city of Dezhou and Maoming in the south. More than three-quarters of its land reserve for future development was also held in these types of cities.

But as China's economy started slowing during and after its COVID-19 lockdowns, property sales in those areas has plummeted along with values of the homes themselves.

The average new home price in the 35 smallest cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics fell on a year-on-year basis for a 17th month in June.

Country Garden's sales in 2020 were 570.7 billion yuan ($78.22 billion), but that slipped to 357.5 billion yuan in 2022. Lower sales, coupled with tighter access to fresh funding in recent years worsened the cash squeeze.

""It needs at least 30 billion yuan ($4.12 billion) of sales a month to breakeven but they have been only 10 to 20 something billion yuan (a month) this year because sales in tier-three and fourth cities are very bad now,"" said Oscar Choi, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oscar and Partners Capital Limited.

HIGH VOLUME, LOW MARGIN

Country Garden built its success by quickly selling a large number of units for low margins. Much of its scale was achieved through acquiring large, low-cost parcels of land from local governments. The multi-purpose developments it built included hotels, shops, schools, and sometimes tech parks.

In March, Country Garden Chairperson Yang Huiyan announced the firm would reduce its presence in smaller cities, after reporting a 90% drop in core profit for 2022 and a record net loss of 6.1 billion yuan. But that has seemingly come too late.

With 3,121 projects spread across all of China's provinces, the macro context of Country Garden's financial problems could be more precarious than China Evergrande Group (3333.HK), which has only around 800 projects, Oxford Economics said in a report.

Country Garden has nearly 1 million homes to complete, according to estimates from Japanese investment bank Nomura.

The real estate sector contributes the bulk of revenues to local governments through property taxes and land sales. In 2022, taxes provided 6.9% of local government revenues with 23.9% from sales, for a total of 30.8%, according to a report from Lu Ting, Chief China economist at Nomura.

Land sales revenues in the first half of 2023 were only 50% of those in the same period of 2021, with smaller cities more affected since they are more dependent on land sales, the bank said.

""Moreover, as housing demand in lower-tier cities deteriorates, it is likely to create a negative feedback loop that will further worsen the already deteriorating fiscal conditions,"" Nomura said.

The contagion fears over Country Garden's debt crisis is piling pressure on Beijing to step in, analysts said.

""Property and related sectors remain an important part of (gross domestic product), and their continued decline pulls down economic activity, as well as local government finances,"" said Gerwin Bell, PGIM Fixed Income's Lead Economist for Asia.

""Arresting the adverse spillovers from property will require significantly larger fiscal stimulus than the authorities have so far entertained.""

Summary US crude stockpiles fall by nearly 6 million barrels - EIA

Minutes of Fed meeting due at 1800 GMT

Concerns on China's economy remain key price driver

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Wednesday despite a large drawdown in U.S. crude oil stocks as investors weighed worries about China's embattled economy against expectations of tighter supply in the United States.

Brent crude futures edged up 6 cents to $84.95 a barrel by 11:35 a.m. EDT (1535 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 2 cents higher to $80.97 a barrel.

Both benchmarks fell more than 1% in the previous session to their lowest since Aug. 8.

U.S. crude oil inventories fell by nearly 6 million barrels last week on strong exports and refining run rates, despite crude production rising to its highest since the coronavirus pandemic decimated fuel consumption, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday.

However, product supplied of gasoline fell by 451,000 barrels per day in the week as peak driving season draws to a close.

""We're still seeing a subpar gasoline number...it looks like we're past peak summer travel season for many,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

China's sluggish economy has remained in focus, after retail sales, industrial output and investment figures failed to match expectations, fuelling concern over a deeper, longer-lasting slowdown.

July activity figures have prompted concerns that China may struggle to meet its growth target of about 5% for the year without more fiscal stimulus, and calls for authorities to take decisive steps.

Without giving details, a cabinet meeting chaired on Wednesday by Premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies aimed at boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Both the OPEC+ group, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are banking on China - the world's biggest oil importer - to galvanise crude demand over the rest of 2023.

Whilst dismal Chinese economic indicators have been causing headaches, providing a justified excuse for investors to go on the defensive, the global oil balance shows no signs of loosening up, PVM analyst Tamas Varga said, citing the latest numbers on U.S. crude inventories.

Investors will also have eyes on minutes from the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting for further cues on interest rate strategy at the world's biggest oil consumer.

The outlook in the fourth quarter will ""depend on the macroeconomic situation in China primarily, albeit it looks like Saudi will continue to address that via their cuts, if needed"", said Rystad Energy's research director Claudio Galimberti.

Supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia have pushed up oil prices over the past seven weeks. Figures published on Wednesday showed that Riyadh's crude exports fell to their lowest since September 2021.

Maui's displaced grow anxious as wildfire recovery drags on,"LAHAINA, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A week after wildfire ravaged the resort town of Lahaina, traumatized Maui residents have grown weary from living off relief supplies while many are kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news about their missing loved one.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Kiet Ma, a 56-year-old taxi driver who lost his home, said he found the local disaster response disorganized.

""The police, everyone, first responders, they're all rushing in but not enough manpower, and it's chaos,"" Ma said from his in-laws' home on the outskirts of Lahaina, where he is staying indefinitely.

Even as donations have poured in and Hawaii and federal officials have promised vast resources to aid in the recovery, Kanamu Balinbin, a local football coach, took matters into his own hands, setting up a relief camp where people who lost their homes and belongings could find water and food.

""I was devastated. I consider myself a strong leader, but it broke me,"" Balinbin said about his emotions after witnessing the destruction. ""This is what keeps me going, helping people. A lot of us are at that stage.""

He said some of the local frustration stemmed from the longstanding perception that Maui does not receive enough attention from the state government despite its robust tourism revenues.

Mary Kerstulovich, a Maui real estate agent who has sought supplies and housing for evacuees, said there was finally a sense government relief was arriving a full week after the disaster, but she said Lahaina still needed a more effective plan to obtain goods.

""There is still a lot of chaos. People need supplies still,"" Kerstulovich said.

Keith Turi, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's deputy associate administrator for response and recovery, acknowledged the deep sense of loss felt by survivors, but said FEMA had a warehouse of supplies in Hawaii and was working with state and county officials to supply shelters and relief operations.

""In the days immediately after something like this, there's a range of frustrations and challenges. But we feel like that in coordination with our partners that we are well positioned to be providing that support,"" Turi told reporters.

The fire destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.

Adding to the local frustration, few residents have been permitted back into Lahaina to visit their properties. Hawaii Governor Josh Green announced Tuesday night that Lahaina residents and employees would be allowed onto a highway leading to town. A previous relaxation of the road closure was soon halted after curiosity seekers clogged streets being used by rescue workers.

Meanwhile, up to 20 cadaver dogs have led search teams on a block-by-block search of the ashes, covering 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Green said in a televised address.

Bar chart shows visitor spending share of GDP to Maui and Hawaii which are much higher than that for the entire U.S.

President Joe Biden has said he would like to visit Maui as soon as possible, which Green said would be ""in the coming weeks"" to avoid disrupting recovery efforts.

""He did not want to interfere with the incredibly difficult emotional, physical work that goes on in a disaster zone,"" Green said after speaking with the president.

Only three of the deceased had been officially identified as of Monday, police said, but stories about those who perished have begun to emerge from friends and relatives.

On the fundraising website GoFundMe, relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home on Thursday morning.

""Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family,"" the post said, noting that the Tanakas have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.

Another post described how Joe Schilling - ""Uncle Joe"" to his adopted family, the Bluhs - died while helping five elderly people escape from his housing complex.

""He was known as 'Funcle Joe' for a reason,"" Akiva Bluh wrote. ""Whether it be the trips to go bullet-shell hunting or staying up late while my parents were gone so he could sneak us his famous sugar toast, he was always willing to act out of love and kindness towards myself and my brothers.""

Companies Eurostat Follow

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2023, even as the bloc's economy grew slightly, statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.

The EU's emissions over the January to March quarter amounted to 941 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, down 2.9% from a year earlier, while the economy grew 1.2% year-on-year.

As the world grapples with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather from climate change, including heatwaves in Portugal and Spain, the EU is pushing towards its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year it banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.

Emissions fell in 21 of the bloc's 27 countries, with the largest decreases seen in Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovenia. They grew however in Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Households were responsible for the biggest share - nearly a quarter - of total greenhouse gas emissions, Eurostat said, while manufacturing accounted for a fifth.

Electricity and gas supply - the sector where emissions fell the most - still contributed 19% to the total figure, with agriculture accounting for 13% and transportation and storage responsible for 10%.

Spain's acting PM Sanchez says he will seek investiture vote,"Spain's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sanchez attends a campaign closing rally ahead of the general election, in Getafe, Spain July 21, 2023 REUTERS/Violeta Santos Moura/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MADRID, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he intended to seek the support of the lower house to form a new government after an inconclusive election on July 23.

""I will ask for parliament's confidence to form a progressive government,"" Sanchez said in a address to the legislators of his Socialist Party (PSOE).

He said his party, which won the second-highest number of seats in the general election held last month, will first seek to clinch the lower house speaker position on Thursday.

Spain's election in July produced no outright winner, with the conservative People's Party (PP) gaining the most seats but falling short of a majority. Both the PP and PSOE have since begun negotiating with smaller parties to court their votes in parliament to form a government.

Sanchez, who first took power in 2018, has ruled since early 2020 thanks to a minority coalition with the far-left Podemos party.

He did not say on Wednesday who his coalition partners would be, but has previously said he intends to ally with far-left alliance, Sumar that includes Podemos.

Sanchez's PSOE, which together with Sumar has 152 seats, will need the 14 parliamentary votes of Catalan separatist parties Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) and the more hardline Junts to win an investiture vote in the 350-seat parliament.

While the ERC has indicated a willingness to reach an accord, Junts has stuck to its demands of permission to hold a referendum on Catalan independence and an amnesty for all separatists facing legal charges related to the region's 2017 failed independence bid. This includes its exiled leader Carles Puigdemont, who Spanish authorities are seeking to extradite from Belgium.

In a nod to the separatists, the Socialists have proposed Francina Armengol as speaker of the lower house. Armengol was regional president of the Balearic Islands from 2015-2023, where she governed in coalition with nationalist parties including the local version of ERC.

Junts has not yet indicated whether it will back Armengol's candidacy on Thursday.

The conservative People's Party won more seats than the Socialists, but did not secure an outright majority and faces an uphill battle as it so far lacks enough support to form a government.

It has so far failed to persuade the centre-right Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to support its investiture even after the hard-right Vox attempted to clear the way for other parties to back the PP by hinting that it would not insist on being part of a right-wing coalition.

The PNV and Coalicion Canaria, which has one seat, had previously said they would not back a government that included the first far-right party since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - A year of intense training to discern the difference between human and animal remains is a must for the specialized search dogs deployed to work on Maui following last week's deadly wildfires.

But it also takes a dog born with the particular personality needed for the job to find remains of the missing and help bring closure for anguished families, said Mary Cablk, an expert in detection and systems at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada, who has trained hundreds of canines, designed training programs for handlers and still goes out on dozens of searches a year with her own dogs.

""Dogs that really want to play, that are obsessive about their toy, that are confident and agile, that are not afraid of loud noises or weird surfaces, bring a lot to the table,"" she said. Cablk is not involved in the Maui recovery operation.

Nagorno-Karabakh residents say 'disastrous' blockade choking supplies,"Summary UN Security Council to discuss eight-month Karabakh blockade

Armenians may face genocide in Karabakh, says former ICC prosecutor

Azerbaijan says it needed to stop arms supplies from Armenia

TBILISI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month.

The crisis has highlighted how Russia, which is pre-occupied with the war in Ukraine, is struggling to project its influence in neighbouring post-Soviet states.

Farhad Mammadov, the head of Baku's Centre for Studies of the South Caucasus think tank, said that controls on the road were necessary to prevent the transit of ""arms and Armenian soldiers"" to and from Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has said it is ready to open supplies to Karabakh via territory under its control, but that the separatist authorities must dissolve and integrate the region into Azerbaijan. The Armenian side has said that the blockade is aimed at forcing Karabakh into unconditional surrender to Baku.

English teacher Shahverdyan said: ""They are doing so that the people become… so desperate that they just simply leave"".

However, like other Karabakh Armenians who spoke to Reuters, Shahverdyan said it had only bolstered their determination to stay in their ancestral homeland.

""How can you live under a government or people who starve you for eight months?""

China's fertility rate drops to record low 1.09 in 2022- state media,"HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's fertility rate is estimated to have dropped to a record low of 1.09 in 2022, the National Business Daily said on Tuesday, a figure likely to rattle authorities as they try to boost the country's declining number of new births.

The state-backed Daily said the figure from China's Population and Development Research Center put it as having the lowest fertility level among countries with a population of more than 100 million.

China's fertility rate is already one of the world's lowest alongside South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Concerned about China's first population drop in six decades and its rapid ageing population, Beijing is urgently trying an array of measures to lift the birth rate including financial incentives and improved childcare facilities.

President Xi Jinping in May presided over a meeting to study the topic.

China has said it will focus on education, science and technology to improve population quality and strive to maintain a ""moderate fertility"" level to support economic growth in future.

High childcare costs and having to stop their careers have put many women off having more children or any at all. Gender discrimination and traditional stereotypes of women caring for their children are still widespread throughout the country. Authorities have in recent months increased rhetoric on sharing the duty of child rearing but paternity leave is still limited in most provinces.

Hong Kong's Family Planning Association said in a separate release on Tuesday that the number of childless women in the special Chinese administrative region more than doubled from five years ago to 43.2% last year.

The percentage of couples with one or two children also tumbled while the average number of children per woman dropped from 1.3 in 2017 to a record low of 0.9 last year, according to its survey.

Summary

Companies Up to 80% Israeli tech startups registering in US - survey

Wealthy U.S. funds, pro-business policies are pull factors

Some cite uncertainty over Israeli judicial overhaul

JERUSALEM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A growing number of Israel's tech startups are incorporating in the United States, attracted by deep pocketed U.S. funds and pro-business policies, and with an extra push from a planned judicial overhaul at home that has rattled investors.

That marks a reversal, as Israel had managed in the past decade to persuade more of its startups to set up their legal identity domestically.

It may not mean jobs shifting overseas en masse - the tech sector accounts for 14% of Israeli jobs - but registering companies or intellectual property (IP) abroad can affect where taxes are paid and so impact government revenue.

Entrepreneurs and investors told Reuters there were good business reasons for incorporating in the United States, and particularly Delaware, which is considered pro-business and a tax haven as it has low corporate and no state sales taxes.

But some also cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, which his right-wing government says is needed to tackle over-reach by the courts but which critics view as an assault on democracy.

Though the overhaul does not directly affect the tech sector, Ian Amit, a former Israeli military officer, frets about its impact and is taking his startup across the Atlantic.

""It's just a very high level of uncertainty,"" said Amit, who is registering his artificial intelligence-based cloud security firm Gomboc in Delaware.

""It mainly really revolves around corruption and uncertainty of what system is there to protect me as a business, from a tax perspective, from a legal perspective or an intellectual property perspective,"" he said.

The economic risk for Israel's government is that its plans, which have sparked unprecedented nationwide protests, scare a tech industry that accounts for almost a fifth of the country's gross domestic product and about 30% of tax income. Some entrepreneurs already appear to be voting with their feet.

As many as 80% of new Israeli tech startups in 2023 have so far chosen to incorporate in Delaware, up from 20% in 2022, according to an Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) survey that also showed companies intend to register future IP overseas. IIA did not give the number of companies surveyed.

""The fact that you are shaking up the judicial system puts Israel in a very high level of uncertainty and investors don't like uncertainty,"" said IIA Chairman Ami Applebaum, who is also chief scientist at the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology.

Yair Geva, a partner who runs the tech group at law firm Herzog, Fox and Neeman, said that not only were new Israeli companies incorporating in Delaware, but some existing ones were expanding research and other operations outside of Israel.

""So, it's somewhat of a bigger issue than just the incorporation aspect of it,"" he said.

A survey of 615 firms by Startup Nation Central showed that 8% of Israeli startup/tech companies had started moving their headquarters abroad, and 29% intended to do so soon.

STARTUP NATION

Some entrepreneurs and investors said the decision to register in the United States was business, not political.

After all, Israel's tech sector relies heavily on foreign investment, and a drop in funding to startups following interest rate rises and the collapse of major tech investor Silicon Valley Bank may be encouraging firms to go where the money is.

""If you want to operate in a global world and you want American investors ... then that's the way it is,"" said Ronen Feldman, founder and CEO of ProntoNLP.ai. ""It's pure business.""

Tomer Tzach, CEO and co-founder of agri-tech company CropX, is considering switching incorporation to Delaware.

""At the end of the day as a CEO I need to do what's right for my shareholders, my investors, my company and I feel terrible about it,"" said Tzach.

Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based early-stage venture investor, has invested in more than a dozen Israeli startups since 2015. He insists on Delaware incorporation and existing Israeli startups seeking a new funding round from him must switch.

""It's better to have a Delaware C Corp from the beginning. It's true in all cases, without exception,"" he said.

But the Israeli government's judicial overhaul is casting a shadow for some.

Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and long-time investor in Israeli startups, has been happy to invest in Israeli-based tech firms over the past decade. He isn't forcing existing portfolio firms to switch but now recommends entrepreneurs incorporate in Delaware and open an Israeli unit.

""I don't view it as 'Israel's not good anymore'. We don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows. It is just uncertainty versus certainty,"" said Fisher.

Setting up shop in Delaware is mostly psychological, according to Ayal Shenhav, head of hi-tech and venture capital at law firm Gross & Co.

""It's not something concrete that you can say 'judges in Israel are corrupt'. No one is saying that,"" he said. ""It's just a feeling that it is not as stable as it used to be and a lot of people follow the crowd.""

Yaron Samid, managing partner of the TechAviv Founder Partners fund, said that for U.S. investors incorporating in Delaware removes ""one variant in a highly uncertain business of a startup"", but investment in Israeli startups would continue.

""Israel tech is not going anywhere,"" he said, ""because we have a an incredible bunch of talent that is producing more and more great companies, so whether they are structured as U.S. or Israeli corporations is really not significant for the tech ecosystem.""

Summary US crude stockpiles fall by nearly 6 million barrels - EIA

Minutes of Fed meeting due at 1800 GMT

Concerns on China's economy remain key price driver

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Wednesday despite a large drawdown in U.S. crude oil stocks as investors weighed worries about China's embattled economy against expectations of tighter supply in the United States.

Brent crude futures edged up 6 cents to $84.95 a barrel by 11:35 a.m. EDT (1535 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) fell 2 cents higher to $80.97 a barrel.

Both benchmarks fell more than 1% in the previous session to their lowest since Aug. 8.

U.S. crude oil inventories fell by nearly 6 million barrels last week on strong exports and refining run rates, despite crude production rising to its highest since the coronavirus pandemic decimated fuel consumption, Energy Information Administration data showed on Wednesday.

However, product supplied of gasoline fell by 451,000 barrels per day in the week as peak driving season draws to a close.

""We're still seeing a subpar gasoline number...it looks like we're past peak summer travel season for many,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

China's sluggish economy has remained in focus, after retail sales, industrial output and investment figures failed to match expectations, fuelling concern over a deeper, longer-lasting slowdown.

July activity figures have prompted concerns that China may struggle to meet its growth target of about 5% for the year without more fiscal stimulus, and calls for authorities to take decisive steps.

Without giving details, a cabinet meeting chaired on Wednesday by Premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies aimed at boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Both the OPEC+ group, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are banking on China - the world's biggest oil importer - to galvanise crude demand over the rest of 2023.

Whilst dismal Chinese economic indicators have been causing headaches, providing a justified excuse for investors to go on the defensive, the global oil balance shows no signs of loosening up, PVM analyst Tamas Varga said, citing the latest numbers on U.S. crude inventories.

Investors will also have eyes on minutes from the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting for further cues on interest rate strategy at the world's biggest oil consumer.

The outlook in the fourth quarter will ""depend on the macroeconomic situation in China primarily, albeit it looks like Saudi will continue to address that via their cuts, if needed"", said Rystad Energy's research director Claudio Galimberti.

Supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia have pushed up oil prices over the past seven weeks. Figures published on Wednesday showed that Riyadh's crude exports fell to their lowest since September 2021.

Maui's displaced grow anxious as wildfire recovery drags on,"LAHAINA, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A week after wildfire ravaged the resort town of Lahaina, traumatized Maui residents have grown weary from living off relief supplies while many are kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news about their missing loved one.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Kiet Ma, a 56-year-old taxi driver who lost his home, said he found the local disaster response disorganized.

""The police, everyone, first responders, they're all rushing in but not enough manpower, and it's chaos,"" Ma said from his in-laws' home on the outskirts of Lahaina, where he is staying indefinitely.

Even as donations have poured in and Hawaii and federal officials have promised vast resources to aid in the recovery, Kanamu Balinbin, a local football coach, took matters into his own hands, setting up a relief camp where people who lost their homes and belongings could find water and food.

""I was devastated. I consider myself a strong leader, but it broke me,"" Balinbin said about his emotions after witnessing the destruction. ""This is what keeps me going, helping people. A lot of us are at that stage.""

He said some of the local frustration stemmed from the longstanding perception that Maui does not receive enough attention from the state government despite its robust tourism revenues.

Mary Kerstulovich, a Maui real estate agent who has sought supplies and housing for evacuees, said there was finally a sense government relief was arriving a full week after the disaster, but she said Lahaina still needed a more effective plan to obtain goods.

""There is still a lot of chaos. People need supplies still,"" Kerstulovich said.

Keith Turi, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's deputy associate administrator for response and recovery, acknowledged the deep sense of loss felt by survivors, but said FEMA had a warehouse of supplies in Hawaii and was working with state and county officials to supply shelters and relief operations.

""In the days immediately after something like this, there's a range of frustrations and challenges. But we feel like that in coordination with our partners that we are well positioned to be providing that support,"" Turi told reporters.

The fire destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.

Adding to the local frustration, few residents have been permitted back into Lahaina to visit their properties. Hawaii Governor Josh Green announced Tuesday night that Lahaina residents and employees would be allowed onto a highway leading to town. A previous relaxation of the road closure was soon halted after curiosity seekers clogged streets being used by rescue workers.

Meanwhile, up to 20 cadaver dogs have led search teams on a block-by-block search of the ashes, covering 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Green said in a televised address.

Bar chart shows visitor spending share of GDP to Maui and Hawaii which are much higher than that for the entire U.S.

President Joe Biden has said he would like to visit Maui as soon as possible, which Green said would be ""in the coming weeks"" to avoid disrupting recovery efforts.

""He did not want to interfere with the incredibly difficult emotional, physical work that goes on in a disaster zone,"" Green said after speaking with the president.

Only three of the deceased had been officially identified as of Monday, police said, but stories about those who perished have begun to emerge from friends and relatives.

On the fundraising website GoFundMe, relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home on Thursday morning.

""Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family,"" the post said, noting that the Tanakas have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.

Another post described how Joe Schilling - ""Uncle Joe"" to his adopted family, the Bluhs - died while helping five elderly people escape from his housing complex.

""He was known as 'Funcle Joe' for a reason,"" Akiva Bluh wrote. ""Whether it be the trips to go bullet-shell hunting or staying up late while my parents were gone so he could sneak us his famous sugar toast, he was always willing to act out of love and kindness towards myself and my brothers.""

Companies Eurostat Follow

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2023, even as the bloc's economy grew slightly, statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.

The EU's emissions over the January to March quarter amounted to 941 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, down 2.9% from a year earlier, while the economy grew 1.2% year-on-year.

As the world grapples with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather from climate change, including heatwaves in Portugal and Spain, the EU is pushing towards its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year it banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.

Emissions fell in 21 of the bloc's 27 countries, with the largest decreases seen in Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovenia. They grew however in Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Households were responsible for the biggest share - nearly a quarter - of total greenhouse gas emissions, Eurostat said, while manufacturing accounted for a fifth.

Electricity and gas supply - the sector where emissions fell the most - still contributed 19% to the total figure, with agriculture accounting for 13% and transportation and storage responsible for 10%.

Spain's acting PM Sanchez says he will seek investiture vote,"Spain's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sanchez attends a campaign closing rally ahead of the general election, in Getafe, Spain July 21, 2023 REUTERS/Violeta Santos Moura/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MADRID, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he intended to seek the support of the lower house to form a new government after an inconclusive election on July 23.

""I will ask for parliament's confidence to form a progressive government,"" Sanchez said in a address to the legislators of his Socialist Party (PSOE).

He said his party, which won the second-highest number of seats in the general election held last month, will first seek to clinch the lower house speaker position on Thursday.

Spain's election in July produced no outright winner, with the conservative People's Party (PP) gaining the most seats but falling short of a majority. Both the PP and PSOE have since begun negotiating with smaller parties to court their votes in parliament to form a government.

Sanchez, who first took power in 2018, has ruled since early 2020 thanks to a minority coalition with the far-left Podemos party.

He did not say on Wednesday who his coalition partners would be, but has previously said he intends to ally with far-left alliance, Sumar that includes Podemos.

Sanchez's PSOE, which together with Sumar has 152 seats, will need the 14 parliamentary votes of Catalan separatist parties Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) and the more hardline Junts to win an investiture vote in the 350-seat parliament.

While the ERC has indicated a willingness to reach an accord, Junts has stuck to its demands of permission to hold a referendum on Catalan independence and an amnesty for all separatists facing legal charges related to the region's 2017 failed independence bid. This includes its exiled leader Carles Puigdemont, who Spanish authorities are seeking to extradite from Belgium.

In a nod to the separatists, the Socialists have proposed Francina Armengol as speaker of the lower house. Armengol was regional president of the Balearic Islands from 2015-2023, where she governed in coalition with nationalist parties including the local version of ERC.

Junts has not yet indicated whether it will back Armengol's candidacy on Thursday.

The conservative People's Party won more seats than the Socialists, but did not secure an outright majority and faces an uphill battle as it so far lacks enough support to form a government.

It has so far failed to persuade the centre-right Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to support its investiture even after the hard-right Vox attempted to clear the way for other parties to back the PP by hinting that it would not insist on being part of a right-wing coalition.

The PNV and Coalicion Canaria, which has one seat, had previously said they would not back a government that included the first far-right party since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

Highly trained dogs take on mission of finding Hawaii fire victims,"Members of FEMA Urban Search and Rescue teams Washington Task Force 1 and Nevada Task Force 1 continue searching through destroyed neighborhoods in the Maui city of Lahaina, Hawaii, U.S. August 13, 2023. Dominick Del Vecchio/FEMA/Handout via REUTERS. Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - A year of intense training to discern the difference between human and animal remains is a must for the specialized search dogs deployed to work on Maui following last week's deadly wildfires.

But it also takes a dog born with the particular personality needed for the job to find remains of the missing and help bring closure for anguished families, said Mary Cablk, an expert in detection and systems at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada, who has trained hundreds of canines, designed training programs for handlers and still goes out on dozens of searches a year with her own dogs.

""Dogs that really want to play, that are obsessive about their toy, that are confident and agile, that are not afraid of loud noises or weird surfaces, bring a lot to the table,"" she said. Cablk is not involved in the Maui recovery operation.

The wildfires that ravaged Maui last week killed at least 101 people, officials say, making it the deadliest U.S. fire in a century.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) urban search rescue teams had 20 dogs on the ground as of Monday supporting state and local officials combing through the ashes.

Jeremy Greenberg, FEMA's director of operations, said on a call with reporters on Monday that the treacherous conditions on Maui meant that the search is difficult.

Greenberg underscored that while searchers understand that families are desperate to know the fate of missing loved ones, they must ""conduct that search in a safe and respectful manner.""

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Each cadaver dog, which can undergo a year of intense lessons before being ready for missions, can search up to a couple dozen homes' burned down ""footprints"" each day. That number varies depending on conditions.

Hawaii's government has said that at least 2,200 structures were destroyed in the fires, 86% of which were residential buildings.

Dogs that will work fire scenes are trained to detect burnt flesh - and can distinguish human remains from those of pets and other animals. In the aftermath of a fire, the dogs are taught not to become excited and run back and forth from remains they have found to a handler, which could damage a scene. Cadaver dogs working fires will simply lay down once they have found something, Cablk said.

Dogs are also now being trained not to enter the ""footprint"" of a burned down house at all, but to signal to handlers that they have hit upon remains without approaching them.

That training came from lessons learned in deadly wildfires in California in recent years, such as the Paradise, California Camp Fire in which 86 were killed.

""It used to be that people would just go in and they would look, they would rake, they would shovel, and it made the job of the forensic anthropologists more difficult.

""You ended up with remains that were more difficult to identify. And where you had multiple individuals together, those bones got commingled, making the job of investigators even more difficult,"" Cablk said.

Just as teaching hospitals to use cadavers to teach medical students, Cablk said, trainers use human flesh and blood to train dogs. Some countries don't allow human remains in such training, and in those places dogs are taught using animal remains, making rescues more difficult.

Cadaver dogs are trained to associate the scent of human remains with a reward, typically a chew toy, Cablk said. If the dog successfully locates remains, it gets to play with the toy.

""That's the dog's paycheck,"" Cablk said. ""Handlers will carry the reward toy with them, and many dogs, in fact, will come around to the back of the handler and check to make sure that the toy is in their pack.""

Nagorno-Karabakh residents say 'disastrous' blockade choking supplies,"Summary UN Security Council to discuss eight-month Karabakh blockade

Armenians may face genocide in Karabakh, says former ICC prosecutor

Azerbaijan says it needed to stop arms supplies from Armenia

TBILISI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month.

The U.N. Security Council will discuss the blockade on Wednesday, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor this month said the blockade may amount to a ""genocide"" of the local Armenian population - an assertion that Azerbaijan's lawyers said was unsubstantiated and inaccurate.

Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but its population of 120,000 is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian and the enclave's one remaining land link to Armenia, the Lachin corridor policed by Russian peacekeepers, was first disrupted in December.

Three residents of Karabakh said basic foodstuffs, fuel and medicine were almost exhausted.

""It's been a very long time since I've eaten any dairy produce, or eggs,"" Nina Shahverdyan, a 23-year-old English teacher, said in a video call with Reuters from the region's capital, which local Armenians call Stepanakert.

""It's been disastrous because we don't have gas. We have electricity blackouts.""

Armenia's foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan, discussed the situation in Karabakh on Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and stressed the need to avert a ""humanitarian disaster"" there, Russia's TASS state news agency reported.

Karabakh's population has tightened its belt since the blockade, eating only what can be produced locally.

The residents said even food produced within Karabakh itself is delivered only sporadically to Stepanakert, as farmers lack fuel to bring their products to market.

Ani Balayan, a recent high school graduate and photographer, said she had last eaten meat around two weeks ago. She said her family was surviving on bread, alongside the tomatoes, cucumbers and watermelon still available in Stepanakert's markets.

For some weeks, footage has shown Stepanakert's supermarket shelves bare, with little or nothing on sale.

""I went to bed hungry for several days because I could not find bread to bring home,"" Balayan said.

BREAKAWAY REGION

The crisis has highlighted how Russia, which is pre-occupied with the war in Ukraine, is struggling to project its influence in neighbouring post-Soviet states.

Karabakh was claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917, and broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the early 1990s.

In 2020, Azerbaijan retook territory in and around the enclave after a second war that ended in a Russia-brokered ceasefire. The agreement required Russia to ensure that road transport between Armenia and Karabakh remained open.

Since the ceasefire, road links between Armenia and Karabakh hinged on the Lachin corridor, which was blockaded in December by Azerbaijani civilians identifying themselves as ecological activists, while Russian peacekeepers did not intervene.

In April, Azerbaijani border guards installed a checkpoint on the route, tightening the blockade.

'GENOCIDE'?

This month, former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Luis Moreno Ocampo described the blockade as potentially constituting a ""genocide"" of Karabakh Armenians and intending ""to starve"" them.

Rodney Dixon, a lawyer appointed by Azerbaijan to give an assessment on Ocampo's opinion, called the view ""strikingly"" unsubstantiated, inflammatory and inaccurate.

Farhad Mammadov, the head of Baku's Centre for Studies of the South Caucasus think tank, said that controls on the road were necessary to prevent the transit of ""arms and Armenian soldiers"" to and from Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has said it is ready to open supplies to Karabakh via territory under its control, but that the separatist authorities must dissolve and integrate the region into Azerbaijan. The Armenian side has said that the blockade is aimed at forcing Karabakh into unconditional surrender to Baku.

English teacher Shahverdyan said: ""They are doing so that the people become… so desperate that they just simply leave"".

However, like other Karabakh Armenians who spoke to Reuters, Shahverdyan said it had only bolstered their determination to stay in their ancestral homeland.

""How can you live under a government or people who starve you for eight months?""

China's fertility rate drops to record low 1.09 in 2022- state media,"HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's fertility rate is estimated to have dropped to a record low of 1.09 in 2022, the National Business Daily said on Tuesday, a figure likely to rattle authorities as they try to boost the country's declining number of new births.

The state-backed Daily said the figure from China's Population and Development Research Center put it as having the lowest fertility level among countries with a population of more than 100 million.

China's fertility rate is already one of the world's lowest alongside South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Concerned about China's first population drop in six decades and its rapid ageing population, Beijing is urgently trying an array of measures to lift the birth rate including financial incentives and improved childcare facilities.

President Xi Jinping in May presided over a meeting to study the topic.

China has said it will focus on education, science and technology to improve population quality and strive to maintain a ""moderate fertility"" level to support economic growth in future.

High childcare costs and having to stop their careers have put many women off having more children or any at all. Gender discrimination and traditional stereotypes of women caring for their children are still widespread throughout the country. Authorities have in recent months increased rhetoric on sharing the duty of child rearing but paternity leave is still limited in most provinces.

Hong Kong's Family Planning Association said in a separate release on Tuesday that the number of childless women in the special Chinese administrative region more than doubled from five years ago to 43.2% last year.

The percentage of couples with one or two children also tumbled while the average number of children per woman dropped from 1.3 in 2017 to a record low of 0.9 last year, according to its survey.

Summary

Companies Up to 80% Israeli tech startups registering in US - survey

Wealthy U.S. funds, pro-business policies are pull factors

Some cite uncertainty over Israeli judicial overhaul

JERUSALEM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A growing number of Israel's tech startups are incorporating in the United States, attracted by deep pocketed U.S. funds and pro-business policies, and with an extra push from a planned judicial overhaul at home that has rattled investors.

That marks a reversal, as Israel had managed in the past decade to persuade more of its startups to set up their legal identity domestically.

It may not mean jobs shifting overseas en masse - the tech sector accounts for 14% of Israeli jobs - but registering companies or intellectual property (IP) abroad can affect where taxes are paid and so impact government revenue.

Entrepreneurs and investors told Reuters there were good business reasons for incorporating in the United States, and particularly Delaware, which is considered pro-business and a tax haven as it has low corporate and no state sales taxes.

But some also cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, which his right-wing government says is needed to tackle over-reach by the courts but which critics view as an assault on democracy.

Though the overhaul does not directly affect the tech sector, Ian Amit, a former Israeli military officer, frets about its impact and is taking his startup across the Atlantic.

""It's just a very high level of uncertainty,"" said Amit, who is registering his artificial intelligence-based cloud security firm Gomboc in Delaware.

""It mainly really revolves around corruption and uncertainty of what system is there to protect me as a business, from a tax perspective, from a legal perspective or an intellectual property perspective,"" he said.

The economic risk for Israel's government is that its plans, which have sparked unprecedented nationwide protests, scare a tech industry that accounts for almost a fifth of the country's gross domestic product and about 30% of tax income. Some entrepreneurs already appear to be voting with their feet.

As many as 80% of new Israeli tech startups in 2023 have so far chosen to incorporate in Delaware, up from 20% in 2022, according to an Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) survey that also showed companies intend to register future IP overseas. IIA did not give the number of companies surveyed.

""The fact that you are shaking up the judicial system puts Israel in a very high level of uncertainty and investors don't like uncertainty,"" said IIA Chairman Ami Applebaum, who is also chief scientist at the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology.

Yair Geva, a partner who runs the tech group at law firm Herzog, Fox and Neeman, said that not only were new Israeli companies incorporating in Delaware, but some existing ones were expanding research and other operations outside of Israel.

""So, it's somewhat of a bigger issue than just the incorporation aspect of it,"" he said.

A survey of 615 firms by Startup Nation Central showed that 8% of Israeli startup/tech companies had started moving their headquarters abroad, and 29% intended to do so soon.

STARTUP NATION

Some entrepreneurs and investors said the decision to register in the United States was business, not political.

After all, Israel's tech sector relies heavily on foreign investment, and a drop in funding to startups following interest rate rises and the collapse of major tech investor Silicon Valley Bank may be encouraging firms to go where the money is.

""If you want to operate in a global world and you want American investors ... then that's the way it is,"" said Ronen Feldman, founder and CEO of ProntoNLP.ai. ""It's pure business.""

Tomer Tzach, CEO and co-founder of agri-tech company CropX, is considering switching incorporation to Delaware.

""At the end of the day as a CEO I need to do what's right for my shareholders, my investors, my company and I feel terrible about it,"" said Tzach.

Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based early-stage venture investor, has invested in more than a dozen Israeli startups since 2015. He insists on Delaware incorporation and existing Israeli startups seeking a new funding round from him must switch.

""It's better to have a Delaware C Corp from the beginning. It's true in all cases, without exception,"" he said.

But the Israeli government's judicial overhaul is casting a shadow for some.

Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and long-time investor in Israeli startups, has been happy to invest in Israeli-based tech firms over the past decade. He isn't forcing existing portfolio firms to switch but now recommends entrepreneurs incorporate in Delaware and open an Israeli unit.

""I don't view it as 'Israel's not good anymore'. We don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows. It is just uncertainty versus certainty,"" said Fisher.

Setting up shop in Delaware is mostly psychological, according to Ayal Shenhav, head of hi-tech and venture capital at law firm Gross & Co.

""It's not something concrete that you can say 'judges in Israel are corrupt'. No one is saying that,"" he said. ""It's just a feeling that it is not as stable as it used to be and a lot of people follow the crowd.""

Yaron Samid, managing partner of the TechAviv Founder Partners fund, said that for U.S. investors incorporating in Delaware removes ""one variant in a highly uncertain business of a startup"", but investment in Israeli startups would continue.

""Israel tech is not going anywhere,"" he said, ""because we have a an incredible bunch of talent that is producing more and more great companies, so whether they are structured as U.S. or Israeli corporations is really not significant for the tech ecosystem.""

China’s deflation a near-term positive for Western central banks - PIMCO,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Deflationary pressures in China could spill over into global markets, which is potentially near-term good news for Western central banks as they seek to curb inflation, U.S. asset manager PIMCO said on Wednesday.

China's consumer sector fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and a flurry of policies to support the economy failed to shore up activity.

The economic deterioration could moderate inflation in China and, increasingly, also in the markets served by Chinese goods, PIMCO Economist and Managing Director Tiffany Wilding said in a note.

""Persistent deflation in China would likely spill over to developed markets, as a weaker yuan and an elevated inventory-to-sales ratios lower the cost of Chinese goods abroad – a development central bankers in developed markets would likely welcome,"" she said.

“Given the usual lags, deflationary spillovers have likely only just begun to impact global consumer markets, with discounting likely to accelerate over the coming quarters.”

The Chinese central bank cut key policy rates on Tuesday for the second time in three months to boost the economy, but investors have so far been unimpressed.

Oxford Economics said in a note on Wednesday that it had reduced its 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast for China to a below-consensus 5.1%.

""Deflation, weakening trade, collapsing loan demand, and a paralysed property sector dampen our risk appetite,"" it said.

On Wednesday, data showed China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, as policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector.

Meanwhile, a senior official told investors that Zhongrong International Trust Co., a leading Chinese trust firm, had missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month, adding to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact in the financial sector.

""For China, the risk of more pronounced deflationary pressure depends crucially on the government’s policies in the coming months,"" said Wilding.

""Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral,"" she said.

Maui's displaced grow anxious as wildfire recovery drags on,"LAHAINA, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A week after wildfire ravaged the resort town of Lahaina, traumatized Maui residents have grown weary from living off relief supplies while many are kept from inspecting their homes and still left awaiting news about their missing loved one.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Kiet Ma, a 56-year-old taxi driver who lost his home, said he found the local disaster response disorganized.

""The police, everyone, first responders, they're all rushing in but not enough manpower, and it's chaos,"" Ma said from his in-laws' home on the outskirts of Lahaina, where he is staying indefinitely.

Even as donations have poured in and Hawaii and federal officials have promised vast resources to aid in the recovery, Kanamu Balinbin, a local football coach, took matters into his own hands, setting up a relief camp where people who lost their homes and belongings could find water and food.

""I was devastated. I consider myself a strong leader, but it broke me,"" Balinbin said about his emotions after witnessing the destruction. ""This is what keeps me going, helping people. A lot of us are at that stage.""

He said some of the local frustration stemmed from the longstanding perception that Maui does not receive enough attention from the state government despite its robust tourism revenues.

Mary Kerstulovich, a Maui real estate agent who has sought supplies and housing for evacuees, said there was finally a sense government relief was arriving a full week after the disaster, but she said Lahaina still needed a more effective plan to obtain goods.

""There is still a lot of chaos. People need supplies still,"" Kerstulovich said.

Keith Turi, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's deputy associate administrator for response and recovery, acknowledged the deep sense of loss felt by survivors, but said FEMA had a warehouse of supplies in Hawaii and was working with state and county officials to supply shelters and relief operations.

""In the days immediately after something like this, there's a range of frustrations and challenges. But we feel like that in coordination with our partners that we are well positioned to be providing that support,"" Turi told reporters.

The fire destroyed or damaged more than 2,200 buildings, 86% of them residential, and caused an estimated $5.5 billion in damage, officials said.

Adding to the local frustration, few residents have been permitted back into Lahaina to visit their properties. Hawaii Governor Josh Green announced Tuesday night that Lahaina residents and employees would be allowed onto a highway leading to town. A previous relaxation of the road closure was soon halted after curiosity seekers clogged streets being used by rescue workers.

Meanwhile, up to 20 cadaver dogs have led search teams on a block-by-block search of the ashes, covering 27% of the disaster area as of Tuesday, Green said in a televised address.

Bar chart shows visitor spending share of GDP to Maui and Hawaii which are much higher than that for the entire U.S.

President Joe Biden has said he would like to visit Maui as soon as possible, which Green said would be ""in the coming weeks"" to avoid disrupting recovery efforts.

""He did not want to interfere with the incredibly difficult emotional, physical work that goes on in a disaster zone,"" Green said after speaking with the president.

Only three of the deceased had been officially identified as of Monday, police said, but stories about those who perished have begun to emerge from friends and relatives.

On the fundraising website GoFundMe, relatives of Kevin and Saane Tanaka said Saane's sister, 7-year-old nephew and parents were found in a burned-out car near their home on Thursday morning.

""Words cannot express how devastating this is for the family,"" the post said, noting that the Tanakas have had no time to grieve after taking in more than a dozen other displaced relatives.

Another post described how Joe Schilling - ""Uncle Joe"" to his adopted family, the Bluhs - died while helping five elderly people escape from his housing complex.

""He was known as 'Funcle Joe' for a reason,"" Akiva Bluh wrote. ""Whether it be the trips to go bullet-shell hunting or staying up late while my parents were gone so he could sneak us his famous sugar toast, he was always willing to act out of love and kindness towards myself and my brothers.""

Companies Eurostat Follow

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2023, even as the bloc's economy grew slightly, statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.

The EU's emissions over the January to March quarter amounted to 941 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, down 2.9% from a year earlier, while the economy grew 1.2% year-on-year.

As the world grapples with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather from climate change, including heatwaves in Portugal and Spain, the EU is pushing towards its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year it banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.

Emissions fell in 21 of the bloc's 27 countries, with the largest decreases seen in Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovenia. They grew however in Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Households were responsible for the biggest share - nearly a quarter - of total greenhouse gas emissions, Eurostat said, while manufacturing accounted for a fifth.

Electricity and gas supply - the sector where emissions fell the most - still contributed 19% to the total figure, with agriculture accounting for 13% and transportation and storage responsible for 10%.

Spain's acting PM Sanchez says he will seek investiture vote,"Spain's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sanchez attends a campaign closing rally ahead of the general election, in Getafe, Spain July 21, 2023 REUTERS/Violeta Santos Moura/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MADRID, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he intended to seek the support of the lower house to form a new government after an inconclusive election on July 23.

""I will ask for parliament's confidence to form a progressive government,"" Sanchez said in a address to the legislators of his Socialist Party (PSOE).

He said his party, which won the second-highest number of seats in the general election held last month, will first seek to clinch the lower house speaker position on Thursday.

Spain's election in July produced no outright winner, with the conservative People's Party (PP) gaining the most seats but falling short of a majority. Both the PP and PSOE have since begun negotiating with smaller parties to court their votes in parliament to form a government.

Sanchez, who first took power in 2018, has ruled since early 2020 thanks to a minority coalition with the far-left Podemos party.

He did not say on Wednesday who his coalition partners would be, but has previously said he intends to ally with far-left alliance, Sumar that includes Podemos.

Sanchez's PSOE, which together with Sumar has 152 seats, will need the 14 parliamentary votes of Catalan separatist parties Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) and the more hardline Junts to win an investiture vote in the 350-seat parliament.

While the ERC has indicated a willingness to reach an accord, Junts has stuck to its demands of permission to hold a referendum on Catalan independence and an amnesty for all separatists facing legal charges related to the region's 2017 failed independence bid. This includes its exiled leader Carles Puigdemont, who Spanish authorities are seeking to extradite from Belgium.

In a nod to the separatists, the Socialists have proposed Francina Armengol as speaker of the lower house. Armengol was regional president of the Balearic Islands from 2015-2023, where she governed in coalition with nationalist parties including the local version of ERC.

Junts has not yet indicated whether it will back Armengol's candidacy on Thursday.

The conservative People's Party won more seats than the Socialists, but did not secure an outright majority and faces an uphill battle as it so far lacks enough support to form a government.

It has so far failed to persuade the centre-right Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to support its investiture even after the hard-right Vox attempted to clear the way for other parties to back the PP by hinting that it would not insist on being part of a right-wing coalition.

The PNV and Coalicion Canaria, which has one seat, had previously said they would not back a government that included the first far-right party since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

Highly trained dogs take on mission of finding Hawaii fire victims,"Members of FEMA Urban Search and Rescue teams Washington Task Force 1 and Nevada Task Force 1 continue searching through destroyed neighborhoods in the Maui city of Lahaina, Hawaii, U.S. August 13, 2023. Dominick Del Vecchio/FEMA/Handout via REUTERS. Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - A year of intense training to discern the difference between human and animal remains is a must for the specialized search dogs deployed to work on Maui following last week's deadly wildfires.

But it also takes a dog born with the particular personality needed for the job to find remains of the missing and help bring closure for anguished families, said Mary Cablk, an expert in detection and systems at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada, who has trained hundreds of canines, designed training programs for handlers and still goes out on dozens of searches a year with her own dogs.

""Dogs that really want to play, that are obsessive about their toy, that are confident and agile, that are not afraid of loud noises or weird surfaces, bring a lot to the table,"" she said. Cablk is not involved in the Maui recovery operation.

The wildfires that ravaged Maui last week killed at least 101 people, officials say, making it the deadliest U.S. fire in a century.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) urban search rescue teams had 20 dogs on the ground as of Monday supporting state and local officials combing through the ashes.

Jeremy Greenberg, FEMA's director of operations, said on a call with reporters on Monday that the treacherous conditions on Maui meant that the search is difficult.

Greenberg underscored that while searchers understand that families are desperate to know the fate of missing loved ones, they must ""conduct that search in a safe and respectful manner.""

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Each cadaver dog, which can undergo a year of intense lessons before being ready for missions, can search up to a couple dozen homes' burned down ""footprints"" each day. That number varies depending on conditions.

Hawaii's government has said that at least 2,200 structures were destroyed in the fires, 86% of which were residential buildings.

Dogs that will work fire scenes are trained to detect burnt flesh - and can distinguish human remains from those of pets and other animals. In the aftermath of a fire, the dogs are taught not to become excited and run back and forth from remains they have found to a handler, which could damage a scene. Cadaver dogs working fires will simply lay down once they have found something, Cablk said.

Dogs are also now being trained not to enter the ""footprint"" of a burned down house at all, but to signal to handlers that they have hit upon remains without approaching them.

That training came from lessons learned in deadly wildfires in California in recent years, such as the Paradise, California Camp Fire in which 86 were killed.

""It used to be that people would just go in and they would look, they would rake, they would shovel, and it made the job of the forensic anthropologists more difficult.

""You ended up with remains that were more difficult to identify. And where you had multiple individuals together, those bones got commingled, making the job of investigators even more difficult,"" Cablk said.

Just as teaching hospitals to use cadavers to teach medical students, Cablk said, trainers use human flesh and blood to train dogs. Some countries don't allow human remains in such training, and in those places dogs are taught using animal remains, making rescues more difficult.

Cadaver dogs are trained to associate the scent of human remains with a reward, typically a chew toy, Cablk said. If the dog successfully locates remains, it gets to play with the toy.

""That's the dog's paycheck,"" Cablk said. ""Handlers will carry the reward toy with them, and many dogs, in fact, will come around to the back of the handler and check to make sure that the toy is in their pack.""

Nagorno-Karabakh residents say 'disastrous' blockade choking supplies,"Summary UN Security Council to discuss eight-month Karabakh blockade

Armenians may face genocide in Karabakh, says former ICC prosecutor

Azerbaijan says it needed to stop arms supplies from Armenia

TBILISI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month.

The U.N. Security Council will discuss the blockade on Wednesday, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor this month said the blockade may amount to a ""genocide"" of the local Armenian population - an assertion that Azerbaijan's lawyers said was unsubstantiated and inaccurate.

Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but its population of 120,000 is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian and the enclave's one remaining land link to Armenia, the Lachin corridor policed by Russian peacekeepers, was first disrupted in December.

Three residents of Karabakh said basic foodstuffs, fuel and medicine were almost exhausted.

""It's been a very long time since I've eaten any dairy produce, or eggs,"" Nina Shahverdyan, a 23-year-old English teacher, said in a video call with Reuters from the region's capital, which local Armenians call Stepanakert.

""It's been disastrous because we don't have gas. We have electricity blackouts.""

Armenia's foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan, discussed the situation in Karabakh on Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and stressed the need to avert a ""humanitarian disaster"" there, Russia's TASS state news agency reported.

Karabakh's population has tightened its belt since the blockade, eating only what can be produced locally.

The residents said even food produced within Karabakh itself is delivered only sporadically to Stepanakert, as farmers lack fuel to bring their products to market.

Ani Balayan, a recent high school graduate and photographer, said she had last eaten meat around two weeks ago. She said her family was surviving on bread, alongside the tomatoes, cucumbers and watermelon still available in Stepanakert's markets.

For some weeks, footage has shown Stepanakert's supermarket shelves bare, with little or nothing on sale.

""I went to bed hungry for several days because I could not find bread to bring home,"" Balayan said.

BREAKAWAY REGION

The crisis has highlighted how Russia, which is pre-occupied with the war in Ukraine, is struggling to project its influence in neighbouring post-Soviet states.

Karabakh was claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917, and broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the early 1990s.

In 2020, Azerbaijan retook territory in and around the enclave after a second war that ended in a Russia-brokered ceasefire. The agreement required Russia to ensure that road transport between Armenia and Karabakh remained open.

Since the ceasefire, road links between Armenia and Karabakh hinged on the Lachin corridor, which was blockaded in December by Azerbaijani civilians identifying themselves as ecological activists, while Russian peacekeepers did not intervene.

In April, Azerbaijani border guards installed a checkpoint on the route, tightening the blockade.

'GENOCIDE'?

This month, former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Luis Moreno Ocampo described the blockade as potentially constituting a ""genocide"" of Karabakh Armenians and intending ""to starve"" them.

Rodney Dixon, a lawyer appointed by Azerbaijan to give an assessment on Ocampo's opinion, called the view ""strikingly"" unsubstantiated, inflammatory and inaccurate.

Farhad Mammadov, the head of Baku's Centre for Studies of the South Caucasus think tank, said that controls on the road were necessary to prevent the transit of ""arms and Armenian soldiers"" to and from Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has said it is ready to open supplies to Karabakh via territory under its control, but that the separatist authorities must dissolve and integrate the region into Azerbaijan. The Armenian side has said that the blockade is aimed at forcing Karabakh into unconditional surrender to Baku.

English teacher Shahverdyan said: ""They are doing so that the people become… so desperate that they just simply leave"".

However, like other Karabakh Armenians who spoke to Reuters, Shahverdyan said it had only bolstered their determination to stay in their ancestral homeland.

""How can you live under a government or people who starve you for eight months?""

China's fertility rate drops to record low 1.09 in 2022- state media,"HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's fertility rate is estimated to have dropped to a record low of 1.09 in 2022, the National Business Daily said on Tuesday, a figure likely to rattle authorities as they try to boost the country's declining number of new births.

The state-backed Daily said the figure from China's Population and Development Research Center put it as having the lowest fertility level among countries with a population of more than 100 million.

China's fertility rate is already one of the world's lowest alongside South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Concerned about China's first population drop in six decades and its rapid ageing population, Beijing is urgently trying an array of measures to lift the birth rate including financial incentives and improved childcare facilities.

President Xi Jinping in May presided over a meeting to study the topic.

China has said it will focus on education, science and technology to improve population quality and strive to maintain a ""moderate fertility"" level to support economic growth in future.

High childcare costs and having to stop their careers have put many women off having more children or any at all. Gender discrimination and traditional stereotypes of women caring for their children are still widespread throughout the country. Authorities have in recent months increased rhetoric on sharing the duty of child rearing but paternity leave is still limited in most provinces.

Hong Kong's Family Planning Association said in a separate release on Tuesday that the number of childless women in the special Chinese administrative region more than doubled from five years ago to 43.2% last year.

The percentage of couples with one or two children also tumbled while the average number of children per woman dropped from 1.3 in 2017 to a record low of 0.9 last year, according to its survey.

Summary

Companies Up to 80% Israeli tech startups registering in US - survey

Wealthy U.S. funds, pro-business policies are pull factors

Some cite uncertainty over Israeli judicial overhaul

JERUSALEM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A growing number of Israel's tech startups are incorporating in the United States, attracted by deep pocketed U.S. funds and pro-business policies, and with an extra push from a planned judicial overhaul at home that has rattled investors.

That marks a reversal, as Israel had managed in the past decade to persuade more of its startups to set up their legal identity domestically.

It may not mean jobs shifting overseas en masse - the tech sector accounts for 14% of Israeli jobs - but registering companies or intellectual property (IP) abroad can affect where taxes are paid and so impact government revenue.

Entrepreneurs and investors told Reuters there were good business reasons for incorporating in the United States, and particularly Delaware, which is considered pro-business and a tax haven as it has low corporate and no state sales taxes.

But some also cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, which his right-wing government says is needed to tackle over-reach by the courts but which critics view as an assault on democracy.

Though the overhaul does not directly affect the tech sector, Ian Amit, a former Israeli military officer, frets about its impact and is taking his startup across the Atlantic.

""It's just a very high level of uncertainty,"" said Amit, who is registering his artificial intelligence-based cloud security firm Gomboc in Delaware.

""It mainly really revolves around corruption and uncertainty of what system is there to protect me as a business, from a tax perspective, from a legal perspective or an intellectual property perspective,"" he said.

The economic risk for Israel's government is that its plans, which have sparked unprecedented nationwide protests, scare a tech industry that accounts for almost a fifth of the country's gross domestic product and about 30% of tax income. Some entrepreneurs already appear to be voting with their feet.

As many as 80% of new Israeli tech startups in 2023 have so far chosen to incorporate in Delaware, up from 20% in 2022, according to an Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) survey that also showed companies intend to register future IP overseas. IIA did not give the number of companies surveyed.

""The fact that you are shaking up the judicial system puts Israel in a very high level of uncertainty and investors don't like uncertainty,"" said IIA Chairman Ami Applebaum, who is also chief scientist at the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology.

Yair Geva, a partner who runs the tech group at law firm Herzog, Fox and Neeman, said that not only were new Israeli companies incorporating in Delaware, but some existing ones were expanding research and other operations outside of Israel.

""So, it's somewhat of a bigger issue than just the incorporation aspect of it,"" he said.

A survey of 615 firms by Startup Nation Central showed that 8% of Israeli startup/tech companies had started moving their headquarters abroad, and 29% intended to do so soon.

""If you want to operate in a global world and you want American investors ... then that's the way it is,"" said Ronen Feldman, founder and CEO of ProntoNLP.ai. ""It's pure business.""

Tomer Tzach, CEO and co-founder of agri-tech company CropX, is considering switching incorporation to Delaware.

""At the end of the day as a CEO I need to do what's right for my shareholders, my investors, my company and I feel terrible about it,"" said Tzach.

Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based early-stage venture investor, has invested in more than a dozen Israeli startups since 2015. He insists on Delaware incorporation and existing Israeli startups seeking a new funding round from him must switch.

""I don't view it as 'Israel's not good anymore'. We don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows. It is just uncertainty versus certainty,"" said Fisher.

Setting up shop in Delaware is mostly psychological, according to Ayal Shenhav, head of hi-tech and venture capital at law firm Gross & Co.

""It's not something concrete that you can say 'judges in Israel are corrupt'. No one is saying that,"" he said. ""It's just a feeling that it is not as stable as it used to be and a lot of people follow the crowd.""

Yaron Samid, managing partner of the TechAviv Founder Partners fund, said that for U.S. investors incorporating in Delaware removes ""one variant in a highly uncertain business of a startup"", but investment in Israeli startups would continue.

""Israel tech is not going anywhere,"" he said, ""because we have a an incredible bunch of talent that is producing more and more great companies, so whether they are structured as U.S. or Israeli corporations is really not significant for the tech ecosystem.""

Summary Move Forward refuses to back down

Pheu Thai confident will prevail in PM vote

Unclear if political newcomer Srettha can muster backing

Military wields big influence in legislature

BANGKOK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Thai lawmakers will vote for a new premier next week, the house speaker said on Wednesday, after a court rejected a bid by election winner Move Forward to challenge parliament's blocking of its candidate.

The Constitutional Court dismissed the petition by allies of the party on a technicality, arguing its prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjareonrat, who was twice thwarted by parliament, was not among the complainants.

Thailand has been under a caretaker administration since March and parliament has been deadlocked for weeks over the formation of the next government, after the anti-establishment Move Forward met fierce resistance from conservative lawmakers allied with the royalist military.

Move Forward was the surprise winner of the May election, riding on the back of huge youth and urban support for a liberal policy platform that took aim at some of Thailand's most powerful interest groups, including big business monopolies and the military.

The court's rejection was the latest in a succession of blows for Move Forward. Pita said the party would not give up its fight to govern.

""The problem is at parliament, so we will fix it in parliament,"" Pita said.

The Pheu Thai party, which was a close second in the election, withdrew its backing for Move Forward after Pita's re-nomination was rejected.

Pheu Thai, the populist electoral juggernaut of the billionaire Shinawatra family, is lobbying aggressively for support from conservative, army-backed lawmakers for its candidate, real estate tycoon Srettha Thavisin.

But it is far from certain whether the politically inexperienced Srettha has enough support from the elected lower house and the military-appointed Senate to become prime minister and form a government.

He needs the backing of half of the combined houses, a tough task given Pheu Thai's bitter history with the military and conservative establishment, which has intervened repeatedly to topple its governments during 17 years of on-off political turmoil.

""Whether the choosing of the prime minister will be completed on the day is up to the session,"" house speaker Wan Muhamad Noor Matha told reporters in announcing the Aug. 22 vote on the premiership.

Senior Pheu Thai officials have said they are confident Srettha will prevail even without the support of Move Forward, the biggest party in parliament.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union fell by nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2023, even as the bloc's economy grew slightly, statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.

The EU's emissions over the January to March quarter amounted to 941 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, down 2.9% from a year earlier, while the economy grew 1.2% year-on-year.

As the world grapples with increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather from climate change, including heatwaves in Portugal and Spain, the EU is pushing towards its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Earlier this year it banned the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2035.

Emissions fell in 21 of the bloc's 27 countries, with the largest decreases seen in Bulgaria, Estonia and Slovenia. They grew however in Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

Households were responsible for the biggest share - nearly a quarter - of total greenhouse gas emissions, Eurostat said, while manufacturing accounted for a fifth.

Electricity and gas supply - the sector where emissions fell the most - still contributed 19% to the total figure, with agriculture accounting for 13% and transportation and storage responsible for 10%.

Spain's acting PM Sanchez says he will seek investiture vote,"Spain's Prime Minister and Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sanchez attends a campaign closing rally ahead of the general election, in Getafe, Spain July 21, 2023 REUTERS/Violeta Santos Moura/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MADRID, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Spain's acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday he intended to seek the support of the lower house to form a new government after an inconclusive election on July 23.

""I will ask for parliament's confidence to form a progressive government,"" Sanchez said in a address to the legislators of his Socialist Party (PSOE).

He said his party, which won the second-highest number of seats in the general election held last month, will first seek to clinch the lower house speaker position on Thursday.

Spain's election in July produced no outright winner, with the conservative People's Party (PP) gaining the most seats but falling short of a majority. Both the PP and PSOE have since begun negotiating with smaller parties to court their votes in parliament to form a government.

Sanchez, who first took power in 2018, has ruled since early 2020 thanks to a minority coalition with the far-left Podemos party.

He did not say on Wednesday who his coalition partners would be, but has previously said he intends to ally with far-left alliance, Sumar that includes Podemos.

Sanchez's PSOE, which together with Sumar has 152 seats, will need the 14 parliamentary votes of Catalan separatist parties Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) and the more hardline Junts to win an investiture vote in the 350-seat parliament.

While the ERC has indicated a willingness to reach an accord, Junts has stuck to its demands of permission to hold a referendum on Catalan independence and an amnesty for all separatists facing legal charges related to the region's 2017 failed independence bid. This includes its exiled leader Carles Puigdemont, who Spanish authorities are seeking to extradite from Belgium.

In a nod to the separatists, the Socialists have proposed Francina Armengol as speaker of the lower house. Armengol was regional president of the Balearic Islands from 2015-2023, where she governed in coalition with nationalist parties including the local version of ERC.

Junts has not yet indicated whether it will back Armengol's candidacy on Thursday.

The conservative People's Party won more seats than the Socialists, but did not secure an outright majority and faces an uphill battle as it so far lacks enough support to form a government.

It has so far failed to persuade the centre-right Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to support its investiture even after the hard-right Vox attempted to clear the way for other parties to back the PP by hinting that it would not insist on being part of a right-wing coalition.

The PNV and Coalicion Canaria, which has one seat, had previously said they would not back a government that included the first far-right party since the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.

Highly trained dogs take on mission of finding Hawaii fire victims,"Members of FEMA Urban Search and Rescue teams Washington Task Force 1 and Nevada Task Force 1 continue searching through destroyed neighborhoods in the Maui city of Lahaina, Hawaii, U.S. August 13, 2023. Dominick Del Vecchio/FEMA/Handout via REUTERS. Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - A year of intense training to discern the difference between human and animal remains is a must for the specialized search dogs deployed to work on Maui following last week's deadly wildfires.

But it also takes a dog born with the particular personality needed for the job to find remains of the missing and help bring closure for anguished families, said Mary Cablk, an expert in detection and systems at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada, who has trained hundreds of canines, designed training programs for handlers and still goes out on dozens of searches a year with her own dogs.

""Dogs that really want to play, that are obsessive about their toy, that are confident and agile, that are not afraid of loud noises or weird surfaces, bring a lot to the table,"" she said. Cablk is not involved in the Maui recovery operation.

The wildfires that ravaged Maui last week killed at least 101 people, officials say, making it the deadliest U.S. fire in a century.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) urban search rescue teams had 20 dogs on the ground as of Monday supporting state and local officials combing through the ashes.

Jeremy Greenberg, FEMA's director of operations, said on a call with reporters on Monday that the treacherous conditions on Maui meant that the search is difficult.

Greenberg underscored that while searchers understand that families are desperate to know the fate of missing loved ones, they must ""conduct that search in a safe and respectful manner.""

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Each cadaver dog, which can undergo a year of intense lessons before being ready for missions, can search up to a couple dozen homes' burned down ""footprints"" each day. That number varies depending on conditions.

Hawaii's government has said that at least 2,200 structures were destroyed in the fires, 86% of which were residential buildings.

Dogs that will work fire scenes are trained to detect burnt flesh - and can distinguish human remains from those of pets and other animals. In the aftermath of a fire, the dogs are taught not to become excited and run back and forth from remains they have found to a handler, which could damage a scene. Cadaver dogs working fires will simply lay down once they have found something, Cablk said.

Dogs are also now being trained not to enter the ""footprint"" of a burned down house at all, but to signal to handlers that they have hit upon remains without approaching them.

That training came from lessons learned in deadly wildfires in California in recent years, such as the Paradise, California Camp Fire in which 86 were killed.

""It used to be that people would just go in and they would look, they would rake, they would shovel, and it made the job of the forensic anthropologists more difficult.

""You ended up with remains that were more difficult to identify. And where you had multiple individuals together, those bones got commingled, making the job of investigators even more difficult,"" Cablk said.

Just as teaching hospitals to use cadavers to teach medical students, Cablk said, trainers use human flesh and blood to train dogs. Some countries don't allow human remains in such training, and in those places dogs are taught using animal remains, making rescues more difficult.

Cadaver dogs are trained to associate the scent of human remains with a reward, typically a chew toy, Cablk said. If the dog successfully locates remains, it gets to play with the toy.

""That's the dog's paycheck,"" Cablk said. ""Handlers will carry the reward toy with them, and many dogs, in fact, will come around to the back of the handler and check to make sure that the toy is in their pack.""

Nagorno-Karabakh residents say 'disastrous' blockade choking supplies,"Summary UN Security Council to discuss eight-month Karabakh blockade

Armenians may face genocide in Karabakh, says former ICC prosecutor

Azerbaijan says it needed to stop arms supplies from Armenia

TBILISI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month.

The U.N. Security Council will discuss the blockade on Wednesday, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor this month said the blockade may amount to a ""genocide"" of the local Armenian population - an assertion that Azerbaijan's lawyers said was unsubstantiated and inaccurate.

Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but its population of 120,000 is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian and the enclave's one remaining land link to Armenia, the Lachin corridor policed by Russian peacekeepers, was first disrupted in December.

Three residents of Karabakh said basic foodstuffs, fuel and medicine were almost exhausted.

""It's been a very long time since I've eaten any dairy produce, or eggs,"" Nina Shahverdyan, a 23-year-old English teacher, said in a video call with Reuters from the region's capital, which local Armenians call Stepanakert.

""It's been disastrous because we don't have gas. We have electricity blackouts.""

Armenia's foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan, discussed the situation in Karabakh on Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and stressed the need to avert a ""humanitarian disaster"" there, Russia's TASS state news agency reported.

Karabakh's population has tightened its belt since the blockade, eating only what can be produced locally.

The residents said even food produced within Karabakh itself is delivered only sporadically to Stepanakert, as farmers lack fuel to bring their products to market.

Ani Balayan, a recent high school graduate and photographer, said she had last eaten meat around two weeks ago. She said her family was surviving on bread, alongside the tomatoes, cucumbers and watermelon still available in Stepanakert's markets.

For some weeks, footage has shown Stepanakert's supermarket shelves bare, with little or nothing on sale.

""I went to bed hungry for several days because I could not find bread to bring home,"" Balayan said.

BREAKAWAY REGION

The crisis has highlighted how Russia, which is pre-occupied with the war in Ukraine, is struggling to project its influence in neighbouring post-Soviet states.

Karabakh was claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917, and broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the early 1990s.

In 2020, Azerbaijan retook territory in and around the enclave after a second war that ended in a Russia-brokered ceasefire. The agreement required Russia to ensure that road transport between Armenia and Karabakh remained open.

Since the ceasefire, road links between Armenia and Karabakh hinged on the Lachin corridor, which was blockaded in December by Azerbaijani civilians identifying themselves as ecological activists, while Russian peacekeepers did not intervene.

In April, Azerbaijani border guards installed a checkpoint on the route, tightening the blockade.

'GENOCIDE'?

This month, former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Luis Moreno Ocampo described the blockade as potentially constituting a ""genocide"" of Karabakh Armenians and intending ""to starve"" them.

Rodney Dixon, a lawyer appointed by Azerbaijan to give an assessment on Ocampo's opinion, called the view ""strikingly"" unsubstantiated, inflammatory and inaccurate.

Farhad Mammadov, the head of Baku's Centre for Studies of the South Caucasus think tank, said that controls on the road were necessary to prevent the transit of ""arms and Armenian soldiers"" to and from Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has said it is ready to open supplies to Karabakh via territory under its control, but that the separatist authorities must dissolve and integrate the region into Azerbaijan. The Armenian side has said that the blockade is aimed at forcing Karabakh into unconditional surrender to Baku.

English teacher Shahverdyan said: ""They are doing so that the people become… so desperate that they just simply leave"".

However, like other Karabakh Armenians who spoke to Reuters, Shahverdyan said it had only bolstered their determination to stay in their ancestral homeland.

""How can you live under a government or people who starve you for eight months?""

China's fertility rate drops to record low 1.09 in 2022- state media,"HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's fertility rate is estimated to have dropped to a record low of 1.09 in 2022, the National Business Daily said on Tuesday, a figure likely to rattle authorities as they try to boost the country's declining number of new births.

The state-backed Daily said the figure from China's Population and Development Research Center put it as having the lowest fertility level among countries with a population of more than 100 million.

China's fertility rate is already one of the world's lowest alongside South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Concerned about China's first population drop in six decades and its rapid ageing population, Beijing is urgently trying an array of measures to lift the birth rate including financial incentives and improved childcare facilities.

President Xi Jinping in May presided over a meeting to study the topic.

China has said it will focus on education, science and technology to improve population quality and strive to maintain a ""moderate fertility"" level to support economic growth in future.

High childcare costs and having to stop their careers have put many women off having more children or any at all. Gender discrimination and traditional stereotypes of women caring for their children are still widespread throughout the country. Authorities have in recent months increased rhetoric on sharing the duty of child rearing but paternity leave is still limited in most provinces.

Hong Kong's Family Planning Association said in a separate release on Tuesday that the number of childless women in the special Chinese administrative region more than doubled from five years ago to 43.2% last year.

The percentage of couples with one or two children also tumbled while the average number of children per woman dropped from 1.3 in 2017 to a record low of 0.9 last year, according to its survey.

Summary

Companies Up to 80% Israeli tech startups registering in US - survey

Wealthy U.S. funds, pro-business policies are pull factors

Some cite uncertainty over Israeli judicial overhaul

JERUSALEM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A growing number of Israel's tech startups are incorporating in the United States, attracted by deep pocketed U.S. funds and pro-business policies, and with an extra push from a planned judicial overhaul at home that has rattled investors.

That marks a reversal, as Israel had managed in the past decade to persuade more of its startups to set up their legal identity domestically.

It may not mean jobs shifting overseas en masse - the tech sector accounts for 14% of Israeli jobs - but registering companies or intellectual property (IP) abroad can affect where taxes are paid and so impact government revenue.

Entrepreneurs and investors told Reuters there were good business reasons for incorporating in the United States, and particularly Delaware, which is considered pro-business and a tax haven as it has low corporate and no state sales taxes.

But some also cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, which his right-wing government says is needed to tackle over-reach by the courts but which critics view as an assault on democracy.

Though the overhaul does not directly affect the tech sector, Ian Amit, a former Israeli military officer, frets about its impact and is taking his startup across the Atlantic.

""It's just a very high level of uncertainty,"" said Amit, who is registering his artificial intelligence-based cloud security firm Gomboc in Delaware.

""It mainly really revolves around corruption and uncertainty of what system is there to protect me as a business, from a tax perspective, from a legal perspective or an intellectual property perspective,"" he said.

The economic risk for Israel's government is that its plans, which have sparked unprecedented nationwide protests, scare a tech industry that accounts for almost a fifth of the country's gross domestic product and about 30% of tax income. Some entrepreneurs already appear to be voting with their feet.

As many as 80% of new Israeli tech startups in 2023 have so far chosen to incorporate in Delaware, up from 20% in 2022, according to an Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) survey that also showed companies intend to register future IP overseas. IIA did not give the number of companies surveyed.

""The fact that you are shaking up the judicial system puts Israel in a very high level of uncertainty and investors don't like uncertainty,"" said IIA Chairman Ami Applebaum, who is also chief scientist at the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology.

Yair Geva, a partner who runs the tech group at law firm Herzog, Fox and Neeman, said that not only were new Israeli companies incorporating in Delaware, but some existing ones were expanding research and other operations outside of Israel.

""So, it's somewhat of a bigger issue than just the incorporation aspect of it,"" he said.

A survey of 615 firms by Startup Nation Central showed that 8% of Israeli startup/tech companies had started moving their headquarters abroad, and 29% intended to do so soon.

STARTUP NATION

Some entrepreneurs and investors said the decision to register in the United States was business, not political.

After all, Israel's tech sector relies heavily on foreign investment, and a drop in funding to startups following interest rate rises and the collapse of major tech investor Silicon Valley Bank may be encouraging firms to go where the money is.

""If you want to operate in a global world and you want American investors ... then that's the way it is,"" said Ronen Feldman, founder and CEO of ProntoNLP.ai. ""It's pure business.""

Tomer Tzach, CEO and co-founder of agri-tech company CropX, is considering switching incorporation to Delaware.

""At the end of the day as a CEO I need to do what's right for my shareholders, my investors, my company and I feel terrible about it,"" said Tzach.

Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based early-stage venture investor, has invested in more than a dozen Israeli startups since 2015. He insists on Delaware incorporation and existing Israeli startups seeking a new funding round from him must switch.

""It's better to have a Delaware C Corp from the beginning. It's true in all cases, without exception,"" he said.

But the Israeli government's judicial overhaul is casting a shadow for some.

Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and long-time investor in Israeli startups, has been happy to invest in Israeli-based tech firms over the past decade. He isn't forcing existing portfolio firms to switch but now recommends entrepreneurs incorporate in Delaware and open an Israeli unit.

""I don't view it as 'Israel's not good anymore'. We don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows. It is just uncertainty versus certainty,"" said Fisher.

Setting up shop in Delaware is mostly psychological, according to Ayal Shenhav, head of hi-tech and venture capital at law firm Gross & Co.

""It's not something concrete that you can say 'judges in Israel are corrupt'. No one is saying that,"" he said. ""It's just a feeling that it is not as stable as it used to be and a lot of people follow the crowd.""

Yaron Samid, managing partner of the TechAviv Founder Partners fund, said that for U.S. investors incorporating in Delaware removes ""one variant in a highly uncertain business of a startup"", but investment in Israeli startups would continue.

""Israel tech is not going anywhere,"" he said, ""because we have a an incredible bunch of talent that is producing more and more great companies, so whether they are structured as U.S. or Israeli corporations is really not significant for the tech ecosystem.""

China’s deflation a near-term positive for Western central banks - PIMCO,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Deflationary pressures in China could spill over into global markets, which is potentially near-term good news for Western central banks as they seek to curb inflation, U.S. asset manager PIMCO said on Wednesday.

China's consumer sector fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and a flurry of policies to support the economy failed to shore up activity.

The economic deterioration could moderate inflation in China and, increasingly, also in the markets served by Chinese goods, PIMCO Economist and Managing Director Tiffany Wilding said in a note.

""Persistent deflation in China would likely spill over to developed markets, as a weaker yuan and an elevated inventory-to-sales ratios lower the cost of Chinese goods abroad – a development central bankers in developed markets would likely welcome,"" she said.

“Given the usual lags, deflationary spillovers have likely only just begun to impact global consumer markets, with discounting likely to accelerate over the coming quarters.”

The Chinese central bank cut key policy rates on Tuesday for the second time in three months to boost the economy, but investors have so far been unimpressed.

Oxford Economics said in a note on Wednesday that it had reduced its 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast for China to a below-consensus 5.1%.

""Deflation, weakening trade, collapsing loan demand, and a paralysed property sector dampen our risk appetite,"" it said.

On Wednesday, data showed China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, as policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector.

Meanwhile, a senior official told investors that Zhongrong International Trust Co., a leading Chinese trust firm, had missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month, adding to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact in the financial sector.

""For China, the risk of more pronounced deflationary pressure depends crucially on the government’s policies in the coming months,"" said Wilding.

""Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral,"" she said.

Philippines sees risk of conflict over Taiwan as a 'major concern',"Filipino soldiers stand at attention near a Philippine flag at Thitu island in disputed South China Sea April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Erik De Castro/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MANILA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Philippines seeks to bolster its ability to address threats while underlining the need to strengthen ties with allies while pursuing an independent foreign policy, under a six-year national security policy published on Tuesday.

The 48-page National Security Policy document, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr recently approved, highlighted ""sharpening strategic competition between the United States and China"" and ""heightened rivalries among the major powers"" as contributing to a ""more tense geopolitical landscape"".

""Major concern is also seen in the Cross-Straits relations that has the potential to be the flashpoint in the region,"" the government said in the document, published by the National Security Council, referring to the Taiwan Strait.

""The Philippines is concerned about its economic stability, a potential influx of refugees, and the welfare of overseas populations.""

Beijing, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, has been staging military exercises in the waters off the island to press its claim of sovereignty. The United States and allies such as Japan criticise such pressure on Taiwan.

""Any military conflict in the Taiwan Strait would inevitably affect the Philippines given the geographic proximity of Taiwan to the Philippine archipelago and the presence of over 150,000 Filipinos in Taiwan,"" the government said in the document.

The Philippines' northernmost islands are 190 km (118 miles) away from Taiwan.

The plan also covered government food and energy security priorities and noted that the South China Sea ""remains a primary national interest"".

""The divergences of claims ... claimants' methods of asserting their positions, continue to pose strategic challenges"" that endanger territorial integrity and people's rights, said the Philippines, which is in dispute with China over parts of the sea.

To achieve energy security, the government said it would explore development of offshore reserves, including in the South China Sea, to help reduce dependence on imports.

Ties with China have grown tense under Marcos, as the Philippines pivots back to traditional ally the United States.

The Philippines would strengthen a Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S., along with other existing mechanisms with regional partners, to ""achieve a credible defence capability"", it said.

But it also takes a dog born with the particular personality needed for the job to find remains of the missing and help bring closure for anguished families, said Mary Cablk, an expert in detection and systems at the Desert Research Institute in Nevada, who has trained hundreds of canines, designed training programs for handlers and still goes out on dozens of searches a year with her own dogs.

""Dogs that really want to play, that are obsessive about their toy, that are confident and agile, that are not afraid of loud noises or weird surfaces, bring a lot to the table,"" she said. Cablk is not involved in the Maui recovery operation.

The wildfires that ravaged Maui last week killed at least 101 people, officials say, making it the deadliest U.S. fire in a century.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) urban search rescue teams had 20 dogs on the ground as of Monday supporting state and local officials combing through the ashes.

Jeremy Greenberg, FEMA's director of operations, said on a call with reporters on Monday that the treacherous conditions on Maui meant that the search is difficult.

Greenberg underscored that while searchers understand that families are desperate to know the fate of missing loved ones, they must ""conduct that search in a safe and respectful manner.""

DIFFICULT TERRAIN

Each cadaver dog, which can undergo a year of intense lessons before being ready for missions, can search up to a couple dozen homes' burned down ""footprints"" each day. That number varies depending on conditions.

Hawaii's government has said that at least 2,200 structures were destroyed in the fires, 86% of which were residential buildings.

Dogs that will work fire scenes are trained to detect burnt flesh - and can distinguish human remains from those of pets and other animals. In the aftermath of a fire, the dogs are taught not to become excited and run back and forth from remains they have found to a handler, which could damage a scene. Cadaver dogs working fires will simply lay down once they have found something, Cablk said.

Dogs are also now being trained not to enter the ""footprint"" of a burned down house at all, but to signal to handlers that they have hit upon remains without approaching them.

That training came from lessons learned in deadly wildfires in California in recent years, such as the Paradise, California Camp Fire in which 86 were killed.

""It used to be that people would just go in and they would look, they would rake, they would shovel, and it made the job of the forensic anthropologists more difficult.

""You ended up with remains that were more difficult to identify. And where you had multiple individuals together, those bones got commingled, making the job of investigators even more difficult,"" Cablk said.

Just as teaching hospitals to use cadavers to teach medical students, Cablk said, trainers use human flesh and blood to train dogs. Some countries don't allow human remains in such training, and in those places dogs are taught using animal remains, making rescues more difficult.

Cadaver dogs are trained to associate the scent of human remains with a reward, typically a chew toy, Cablk said. If the dog successfully locates remains, it gets to play with the toy.

""That's the dog's paycheck,"" Cablk said. ""Handlers will carry the reward toy with them, and many dogs, in fact, will come around to the back of the handler and check to make sure that the toy is in their pack.""

Nagorno-Karabakh residents say 'disastrous' blockade choking supplies,"Summary UN Security Council to discuss eight-month Karabakh blockade

Armenians may face genocide in Karabakh, says former ICC prosecutor

Azerbaijan says it needed to stop arms supplies from Armenia

TBILISI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month.

The U.N. Security Council will discuss the blockade on Wednesday, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor this month said the blockade may amount to a ""genocide"" of the local Armenian population - an assertion that Azerbaijan's lawyers said was unsubstantiated and inaccurate.

Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but its population of 120,000 is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian and the enclave's one remaining land link to Armenia, the Lachin corridor policed by Russian peacekeepers, was first disrupted in December.

Three residents of Karabakh said basic foodstuffs, fuel and medicine were almost exhausted.

""It's been a very long time since I've eaten any dairy produce, or eggs,"" Nina Shahverdyan, a 23-year-old English teacher, said in a video call with Reuters from the region's capital, which local Armenians call Stepanakert.

""It's been disastrous because we don't have gas. We have electricity blackouts.""

Armenia's foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan, discussed the situation in Karabakh on Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and stressed the need to avert a ""humanitarian disaster"" there, Russia's TASS state news agency reported.

Karabakh's population has tightened its belt since the blockade, eating only what can be produced locally.

The residents said even food produced within Karabakh itself is delivered only sporadically to Stepanakert, as farmers lack fuel to bring their products to market.

Ani Balayan, a recent high school graduate and photographer, said she had last eaten meat around two weeks ago. She said her family was surviving on bread, alongside the tomatoes, cucumbers and watermelon still available in Stepanakert's markets.

For some weeks, footage has shown Stepanakert's supermarket shelves bare, with little or nothing on sale.

""I went to bed hungry for several days because I could not find bread to bring home,"" Balayan said.

BREAKAWAY REGION

The crisis has highlighted how Russia, which is pre-occupied with the war in Ukraine, is struggling to project its influence in neighbouring post-Soviet states.

Karabakh was claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917, and broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the early 1990s.

In 2020, Azerbaijan retook territory in and around the enclave after a second war that ended in a Russia-brokered ceasefire. The agreement required Russia to ensure that road transport between Armenia and Karabakh remained open.

Since the ceasefire, road links between Armenia and Karabakh hinged on the Lachin corridor, which was blockaded in December by Azerbaijani civilians identifying themselves as ecological activists, while Russian peacekeepers did not intervene.

In April, Azerbaijani border guards installed a checkpoint on the route, tightening the blockade.

'GENOCIDE'?

This month, former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Luis Moreno Ocampo described the blockade as potentially constituting a ""genocide"" of Karabakh Armenians and intending ""to starve"" them.

Rodney Dixon, a lawyer appointed by Azerbaijan to give an assessment on Ocampo's opinion, called the view ""strikingly"" unsubstantiated, inflammatory and inaccurate.

Farhad Mammadov, the head of Baku's Centre for Studies of the South Caucasus think tank, said that controls on the road were necessary to prevent the transit of ""arms and Armenian soldiers"" to and from Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has said it is ready to open supplies to Karabakh via territory under its control, but that the separatist authorities must dissolve and integrate the region into Azerbaijan. The Armenian side has said that the blockade is aimed at forcing Karabakh into unconditional surrender to Baku.

English teacher Shahverdyan said: ""They are doing so that the people become… so desperate that they just simply leave"".

However, like other Karabakh Armenians who spoke to Reuters, Shahverdyan said it had only bolstered their determination to stay in their ancestral homeland.

China's fertility rate drops to record low 1.09 in 2022- state media,"HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's fertility rate is estimated to have dropped to a record low of 1.09 in 2022, the National Business Daily said on Tuesday, a figure likely to rattle authorities as they try to boost the country's declining number of new births.

The state-backed Daily said the figure from China's Population and Development Research Center put it as having the lowest fertility level among countries with a population of more than 100 million.

China's fertility rate is already one of the world's lowest alongside South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Concerned about China's first population drop in six decades and its rapid ageing population, Beijing is urgently trying an array of measures to lift the birth rate including financial incentives and improved childcare facilities.

President Xi Jinping in May presided over a meeting to study the topic.

China has said it will focus on education, science and technology to improve population quality and strive to maintain a ""moderate fertility"" level to support economic growth in future.

High childcare costs and having to stop their careers have put many women off having more children or any at all. Gender discrimination and traditional stereotypes of women caring for their children are still widespread throughout the country. Authorities have in recent months increased rhetoric on sharing the duty of child rearing but paternity leave is still limited in most provinces.

Hong Kong's Family Planning Association said in a separate release on Tuesday that the number of childless women in the special Chinese administrative region more than doubled from five years ago to 43.2% last year.

The percentage of couples with one or two children also tumbled while the average number of children per woman dropped from 1.3 in 2017 to a record low of 0.9 last year, according to its survey.

Israeli tech startups flock to US amid uncertainty at home,"The American and the Israeli national flags can be seen outside the U.S Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Summary

Companies Up to 80% Israeli tech startups registering in US - survey

Wealthy U.S. funds, pro-business policies are pull factors

Some cite uncertainty over Israeli judicial overhaul

JERUSALEM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A growing number of Israel's tech startups are incorporating in the United States, attracted by deep pocketed U.S. funds and pro-business policies, and with an extra push from a planned judicial overhaul at home that has rattled investors.

That marks a reversal, as Israel had managed in the past decade to persuade more of its startups to set up their legal identity domestically.

It may not mean jobs shifting overseas en masse - the tech sector accounts for 14% of Israeli jobs - but registering companies or intellectual property (IP) abroad can affect where taxes are paid and so impact government revenue.

Entrepreneurs and investors told Reuters there were good business reasons for incorporating in the United States, and particularly Delaware, which is considered pro-business and a tax haven as it has low corporate and no state sales taxes.

But some also cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, which his right-wing government says is needed to tackle over-reach by the courts but which critics view as an assault on democracy.

Though the overhaul does not directly affect the tech sector, Ian Amit, a former Israeli military officer, frets about its impact and is taking his startup across the Atlantic.

""It's just a very high level of uncertainty,"" said Amit, who is registering his artificial intelligence-based cloud security firm Gomboc in Delaware.

""It mainly really revolves around corruption and uncertainty of what system is there to protect me as a business, from a tax perspective, from a legal perspective or an intellectual property perspective,"" he said.

The economic risk for Israel's government is that its plans, which have sparked unprecedented nationwide protests, scare a tech industry that accounts for almost a fifth of the country's gross domestic product and about 30% of tax income. Some entrepreneurs already appear to be voting with their feet.

As many as 80% of new Israeli tech startups in 2023 have so far chosen to incorporate in Delaware, up from 20% in 2022, according to an Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) survey that also showed companies intend to register future IP overseas. IIA did not give the number of companies surveyed.

""The fact that you are shaking up the judicial system puts Israel in a very high level of uncertainty and investors don't like uncertainty,"" said IIA Chairman Ami Applebaum, who is also chief scientist at the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology.

Yair Geva, a partner who runs the tech group at law firm Herzog, Fox and Neeman, said that not only were new Israeli companies incorporating in Delaware, but some existing ones were expanding research and other operations outside of Israel.

""So, it's somewhat of a bigger issue than just the incorporation aspect of it,"" he said.

A survey of 615 firms by Startup Nation Central showed that 8% of Israeli startup/tech companies had started moving their headquarters abroad, and 29% intended to do so soon.

STARTUP NATION

Some entrepreneurs and investors said the decision to register in the United States was business, not political.

After all, Israel's tech sector relies heavily on foreign investment, and a drop in funding to startups following interest rate rises and the collapse of major tech investor Silicon Valley Bank may be encouraging firms to go where the money is.

""If you want to operate in a global world and you want American investors ... then that's the way it is,"" said Ronen Feldman, founder and CEO of ProntoNLP.ai. ""It's pure business.""

Tomer Tzach, CEO and co-founder of agri-tech company CropX, is considering switching incorporation to Delaware.

""At the end of the day as a CEO I need to do what's right for my shareholders, my investors, my company and I feel terrible about it,"" said Tzach.

Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based early-stage venture investor, has invested in more than a dozen Israeli startups since 2015. He insists on Delaware incorporation and existing Israeli startups seeking a new funding round from him must switch.

""It's better to have a Delaware C Corp from the beginning. It's true in all cases, without exception,"" he said.

But the Israeli government's judicial overhaul is casting a shadow for some.

Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and long-time investor in Israeli startups, has been happy to invest in Israeli-based tech firms over the past decade. He isn't forcing existing portfolio firms to switch but now recommends entrepreneurs incorporate in Delaware and open an Israeli unit.

""I don't view it as 'Israel's not good anymore'. We don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows. It is just uncertainty versus certainty,"" said Fisher.

Setting up shop in Delaware is mostly psychological, according to Ayal Shenhav, head of hi-tech and venture capital at law firm Gross & Co.

""It's not something concrete that you can say 'judges in Israel are corrupt'. No one is saying that,"" he said. ""It's just a feeling that it is not as stable as it used to be and a lot of people follow the crowd.""

Yaron Samid, managing partner of the TechAviv Founder Partners fund, said that for U.S. investors incorporating in Delaware removes ""one variant in a highly uncertain business of a startup"", but investment in Israeli startups would continue.

""Israel tech is not going anywhere,"" he said, ""because we have a an incredible bunch of talent that is producing more and more great companies, so whether they are structured as U.S. or Israeli corporations is really not significant for the tech ecosystem.""

China’s deflation a near-term positive for Western central banks - PIMCO,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Deflationary pressures in China could spill over into global markets, which is potentially near-term good news for Western central banks as they seek to curb inflation, U.S. asset manager PIMCO said on Wednesday.

China's consumer sector fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and a flurry of policies to support the economy failed to shore up activity.

The economic deterioration could moderate inflation in China and, increasingly, also in the markets served by Chinese goods, PIMCO Economist and Managing Director Tiffany Wilding said in a note.

""Persistent deflation in China would likely spill over to developed markets, as a weaker yuan and an elevated inventory-to-sales ratios lower the cost of Chinese goods abroad – a development central bankers in developed markets would likely welcome,"" she said.

“Given the usual lags, deflationary spillovers have likely only just begun to impact global consumer markets, with discounting likely to accelerate over the coming quarters.”

The Chinese central bank cut key policy rates on Tuesday for the second time in three months to boost the economy, but investors have so far been unimpressed.

Oxford Economics said in a note on Wednesday that it had reduced its 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast for China to a below-consensus 5.1%.

""Deflation, weakening trade, collapsing loan demand, and a paralysed property sector dampen our risk appetite,"" it said.

On Wednesday, data showed China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, as policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector.

Meanwhile, a senior official told investors that Zhongrong International Trust Co., a leading Chinese trust firm, had missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month, adding to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact in the financial sector.

""For China, the risk of more pronounced deflationary pressure depends crucially on the government’s policies in the coming months,"" said Wilding.

""Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral,"" she said.

Thai lawmakers to vote on PM next week in bid to end deadlock,"Move Forward Party Leader Pita Limjaroenrat looks on at a voting session for a new prime minister at the parliament, in Bangkok, Thailand, July 13, 2023. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Summary Move Forward refuses to back down

Pheu Thai confident will prevail in PM vote

Unclear if political newcomer Srettha can muster backing

Military wields big influence in legislature

BANGKOK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Thai lawmakers will vote for a new premier next week, the house speaker said on Wednesday, after a court rejected a bid by election winner Move Forward to challenge parliament's blocking of its candidate.

The Constitutional Court dismissed the petition by allies of the party on a technicality, arguing its prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjareonrat, who was twice thwarted by parliament, was not among the complainants.

Thailand has been under a caretaker administration since March and parliament has been deadlocked for weeks over the formation of the next government, after the anti-establishment Move Forward met fierce resistance from conservative lawmakers allied with the royalist military.

Move Forward was the surprise winner of the May election, riding on the back of huge youth and urban support for a liberal policy platform that took aim at some of Thailand's most powerful interest groups, including big business monopolies and the military.

The court's rejection was the latest in a succession of blows for Move Forward. Pita said the party would not give up its fight to govern.

""The problem is at parliament, so we will fix it in parliament,"" Pita said.

The Pheu Thai party, which was a close second in the election, withdrew its backing for Move Forward after Pita's re-nomination was rejected.

Pheu Thai, the populist electoral juggernaut of the billionaire Shinawatra family, is lobbying aggressively for support from conservative, army-backed lawmakers for its candidate, real estate tycoon Srettha Thavisin.

But it is far from certain whether the politically inexperienced Srettha has enough support from the elected lower house and the military-appointed Senate to become prime minister and form a government.

He needs the backing of half of the combined houses, a tough task given Pheu Thai's bitter history with the military and conservative establishment, which has intervened repeatedly to topple its governments during 17 years of on-off political turmoil.

""Whether the choosing of the prime minister will be completed on the day is up to the session,"" house speaker Wan Muhamad Noor Matha told reporters in announcing the Aug. 22 vote on the premiership.

Senior Pheu Thai officials have said they are confident Srettha will prevail even without the support of Move Forward, the biggest party in parliament.

Philippines sees risk of conflict over Taiwan as a 'major concern',"Filipino soldiers stand at attention near a Philippine flag at Thitu island in disputed South China Sea April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Erik De Castro/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MANILA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Philippines seeks to bolster its ability to address threats while underlining the need to strengthen ties with allies while pursuing an independent foreign policy, under a six-year national security policy published on Tuesday.

The 48-page National Security Policy document, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr recently approved, highlighted ""sharpening strategic competition between the United States and China"" and ""heightened rivalries among the major powers"" as contributing to a ""more tense geopolitical landscape"".

""Major concern is also seen in the Cross-Straits relations that has the potential to be the flashpoint in the region,"" the government said in the document, published by the National Security Council, referring to the Taiwan Strait.

""The Philippines is concerned about its economic stability, a potential influx of refugees, and the welfare of overseas populations.""

Beijing, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, has been staging military exercises in the waters off the island to press its claim of sovereignty. The United States and allies such as Japan criticise such pressure on Taiwan.

""Any military conflict in the Taiwan Strait would inevitably affect the Philippines given the geographic proximity of Taiwan to the Philippine archipelago and the presence of over 150,000 Filipinos in Taiwan,"" the government said in the document.

The Philippines' northernmost islands are 190 km (118 miles) away from Taiwan.

The plan also covered government food and energy security priorities and noted that the South China Sea ""remains a primary national interest"".

""The divergences of claims ... claimants' methods of asserting their positions, continue to pose strategic challenges"" that endanger territorial integrity and people's rights, said the Philippines, which is in dispute with China over parts of the sea.

To achieve energy security, the government said it would explore development of offshore reserves, including in the South China Sea, to help reduce dependence on imports.

Ties with China have grown tense under Marcos, as the Philippines pivots back to traditional ally the United States.

The Philippines would strengthen a Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S., along with other existing mechanisms with regional partners, to ""achieve a credible defence capability"", it said.

"'I love England,' migrant says as he lands after boat crossing","DUNGENESS, England, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Dozens of men, women and children arrived on a shingle beach on the southern coast of England on Wednesday, tired but relieved to be brought ashore by a large orange lifeboat after making the risky sea crossing from France in rubber dinghies.

They are the latest among more than 2,000 migrants who have reached Britain from countries like Iran, Syria and Afghanistan just this month, encouraged by better weather to make the journey in their bid to claim asylum in the UK.

""I love England,"" one bearded man told a Reuters photographer, smiling, as he walked on the gravely beach in a black parka jacket. He said he was from Syria.

Two other men at the beach also said they were Syrian, having reached Britain after passing through Italy and France, while a teenager said he was from Kuwait and it had taken him one month to arrive.

The numbers arriving underscore the scale of the challenge facing British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his pledge to ""stop the boats"" as he prepares for a national election expected next year.

At the beach in Dungeness, amid blue skies and warm weather, migrants disembarked government and charity lifeboats to be taken by bus to the ferry port of Dover an hour away for processing by British authorities.

[1/5]People, believed to be migrants, walk in Dungeness, Britain, August 16, 2023. REUTERS/Toby Melville Acquire Licensing Rights

In total, at least 100 migrants arrived on small boats on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally from Dungeness and Dover.

Those arriving included many children, some barefoot, clutching blankets and walking hand in hand with their parents, or being carried by officials in high-vis jackets.

Almost 17,000 migrants have arrived so far this year, although that is less than during the same period last year. In total, nearly 46,000 migrants were detected arriving in small boats in 2022. Many will have likely paid people smugglers for their crossings, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.

Sunak has faced criticism from some of his own lawmakers for not moving quickly enough to crack down on illegal migration, which has been blamed in parts of the country for stretching public services, including the provision of accommodation.

He has signed deals with France and Turkey to stem the flow of migrants, and his government passed an illegal migration law which plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, although that plan has been bogged down in the courts.

At the moment, however, the flow of migrants shows little sign of slowing as more boats arrive on the southern English coast.

Last year, August represented the highest number of small boat arrivals for any month on record, while half of all migrants arrived during August-October.

China's fertility rate drops to record low 1.09 in 2022- state media,"HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's fertility rate is estimated to have dropped to a record low of 1.09 in 2022, the National Business Daily said on Tuesday, a figure likely to rattle authorities as they try to boost the country's declining number of new births.

The state-backed Daily said the figure from China's Population and Development Research Center put it as having the lowest fertility level among countries with a population of more than 100 million.

China's fertility rate is already one of the world's lowest alongside South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Concerned about China's first population drop in six decades and its rapid ageing population, Beijing is urgently trying an array of measures to lift the birth rate including financial incentives and improved childcare facilities.

President Xi Jinping in May presided over a meeting to study the topic.

China has said it will focus on education, science and technology to improve population quality and strive to maintain a ""moderate fertility"" level to support economic growth in future.

High childcare costs and having to stop their careers have put many women off having more children or any at all. Gender discrimination and traditional stereotypes of women caring for their children are still widespread throughout the country. Authorities have in recent months increased rhetoric on sharing the duty of child rearing but paternity leave is still limited in most provinces.

Hong Kong's Family Planning Association said in a separate release on Tuesday that the number of childless women in the special Chinese administrative region more than doubled from five years ago to 43.2% last year.

The percentage of couples with one or two children also tumbled while the average number of children per woman dropped from 1.3 in 2017 to a record low of 0.9 last year, according to its survey.

Summary

Companies Up to 80% Israeli tech startups registering in US - survey

Wealthy U.S. funds, pro-business policies are pull factors

Some cite uncertainty over Israeli judicial overhaul

JERUSALEM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A growing number of Israel's tech startups are incorporating in the United States, attracted by deep pocketed U.S. funds and pro-business policies, and with an extra push from a planned judicial overhaul at home that has rattled investors.

That marks a reversal, as Israel had managed in the past decade to persuade more of its startups to set up their legal identity domestically.

It may not mean jobs shifting overseas en masse - the tech sector accounts for 14% of Israeli jobs - but registering companies or intellectual property (IP) abroad can affect where taxes are paid and so impact government revenue.

Entrepreneurs and investors told Reuters there were good business reasons for incorporating in the United States, and particularly Delaware, which is considered pro-business and a tax haven as it has low corporate and no state sales taxes.

But some also cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, which his right-wing government says is needed to tackle over-reach by the courts but which critics view as an assault on democracy.

Though the overhaul does not directly affect the tech sector, Ian Amit, a former Israeli military officer, frets about its impact and is taking his startup across the Atlantic.

""It's just a very high level of uncertainty,"" said Amit, who is registering his artificial intelligence-based cloud security firm Gomboc in Delaware.

""It mainly really revolves around corruption and uncertainty of what system is there to protect me as a business, from a tax perspective, from a legal perspective or an intellectual property perspective,"" he said.

The economic risk for Israel's government is that its plans, which have sparked unprecedented nationwide protests, scare a tech industry that accounts for almost a fifth of the country's gross domestic product and about 30% of tax income. Some entrepreneurs already appear to be voting with their feet.

As many as 80% of new Israeli tech startups in 2023 have so far chosen to incorporate in Delaware, up from 20% in 2022, according to an Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) survey that also showed companies intend to register future IP overseas. IIA did not give the number of companies surveyed.

""The fact that you are shaking up the judicial system puts Israel in a very high level of uncertainty and investors don't like uncertainty,"" said IIA Chairman Ami Applebaum, who is also chief scientist at the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology.

Yair Geva, a partner who runs the tech group at law firm Herzog, Fox and Neeman, said that not only were new Israeli companies incorporating in Delaware, but some existing ones were expanding research and other operations outside of Israel.

""So, it's somewhat of a bigger issue than just the incorporation aspect of it,"" he said.

A survey of 615 firms by Startup Nation Central showed that 8% of Israeli startup/tech companies had started moving their headquarters abroad, and 29% intended to do so soon.

STARTUP NATION

Some entrepreneurs and investors said the decision to register in the United States was business, not political.

After all, Israel's tech sector relies heavily on foreign investment, and a drop in funding to startups following interest rate rises and the collapse of major tech investor Silicon Valley Bank may be encouraging firms to go where the money is.

""If you want to operate in a global world and you want American investors ... then that's the way it is,"" said Ronen Feldman, founder and CEO of ProntoNLP.ai. ""It's pure business.""

Tomer Tzach, CEO and co-founder of agri-tech company CropX, is considering switching incorporation to Delaware.

""At the end of the day as a CEO I need to do what's right for my shareholders, my investors, my company and I feel terrible about it,"" said Tzach.

Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based early-stage venture investor, has invested in more than a dozen Israeli startups since 2015. He insists on Delaware incorporation and existing Israeli startups seeking a new funding round from him must switch.

""It's better to have a Delaware C Corp from the beginning. It's true in all cases, without exception,"" he said.

But the Israeli government's judicial overhaul is casting a shadow for some.

Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and long-time investor in Israeli startups, has been happy to invest in Israeli-based tech firms over the past decade. He isn't forcing existing portfolio firms to switch but now recommends entrepreneurs incorporate in Delaware and open an Israeli unit.

""I don't view it as 'Israel's not good anymore'. We don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows. It is just uncertainty versus certainty,"" said Fisher.

Setting up shop in Delaware is mostly psychological, according to Ayal Shenhav, head of hi-tech and venture capital at law firm Gross & Co.

""It's not something concrete that you can say 'judges in Israel are corrupt'. No one is saying that,"" he said. ""It's just a feeling that it is not as stable as it used to be and a lot of people follow the crowd.""

Yaron Samid, managing partner of the TechAviv Founder Partners fund, said that for U.S. investors incorporating in Delaware removes ""one variant in a highly uncertain business of a startup"", but investment in Israeli startups would continue.

""Israel tech is not going anywhere,"" he said, ""because we have a an incredible bunch of talent that is producing more and more great companies, so whether they are structured as U.S. or Israeli corporations is really not significant for the tech ecosystem.""

China’s deflation a near-term positive for Western central banks - PIMCO,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Deflationary pressures in China could spill over into global markets, which is potentially near-term good news for Western central banks as they seek to curb inflation, U.S. asset manager PIMCO said on Wednesday.

China's consumer sector fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and a flurry of policies to support the economy failed to shore up activity.

The economic deterioration could moderate inflation in China and, increasingly, also in the markets served by Chinese goods, PIMCO Economist and Managing Director Tiffany Wilding said in a note.

""Persistent deflation in China would likely spill over to developed markets, as a weaker yuan and an elevated inventory-to-sales ratios lower the cost of Chinese goods abroad – a development central bankers in developed markets would likely welcome,"" she said.

“Given the usual lags, deflationary spillovers have likely only just begun to impact global consumer markets, with discounting likely to accelerate over the coming quarters.”

The Chinese central bank cut key policy rates on Tuesday for the second time in three months to boost the economy, but investors have so far been unimpressed.

Oxford Economics said in a note on Wednesday that it had reduced its 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast for China to a below-consensus 5.1%.

""Deflation, weakening trade, collapsing loan demand, and a paralysed property sector dampen our risk appetite,"" it said.

On Wednesday, data showed China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, as policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector.

Meanwhile, a senior official told investors that Zhongrong International Trust Co., a leading Chinese trust firm, had missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month, adding to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact in the financial sector.

""For China, the risk of more pronounced deflationary pressure depends crucially on the government’s policies in the coming months,"" said Wilding.

""Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral,"" she said.

Summary Move Forward refuses to back down

Pheu Thai confident will prevail in PM vote

Unclear if political newcomer Srettha can muster backing

Military wields big influence in legislature

BANGKOK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Thai lawmakers will vote for a new premier next week, the house speaker said on Wednesday, after a court rejected a bid by election winner Move Forward to challenge parliament's blocking of its candidate.

The Constitutional Court dismissed the petition by allies of the party on a technicality, arguing its prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjareonrat, who was twice thwarted by parliament, was not among the complainants.

Thailand has been under a caretaker administration since March and parliament has been deadlocked for weeks over the formation of the next government, after the anti-establishment Move Forward met fierce resistance from conservative lawmakers allied with the royalist military.

Move Forward was the surprise winner of the May election, riding on the back of huge youth and urban support for a liberal policy platform that took aim at some of Thailand's most powerful interest groups, including big business monopolies and the military.

The court's rejection was the latest in a succession of blows for Move Forward. Pita said the party would not give up its fight to govern.

""The problem is at parliament, so we will fix it in parliament,"" Pita said.

The Pheu Thai party, which was a close second in the election, withdrew its backing for Move Forward after Pita's re-nomination was rejected.

Pheu Thai, the populist electoral juggernaut of the billionaire Shinawatra family, is lobbying aggressively for support from conservative, army-backed lawmakers for its candidate, real estate tycoon Srettha Thavisin.

But it is far from certain whether the politically inexperienced Srettha has enough support from the elected lower house and the military-appointed Senate to become prime minister and form a government.

He needs the backing of half of the combined houses, a tough task given Pheu Thai's bitter history with the military and conservative establishment, which has intervened repeatedly to topple its governments during 17 years of on-off political turmoil.

""Whether the choosing of the prime minister will be completed on the day is up to the session,"" house speaker Wan Muhamad Noor Matha told reporters in announcing the Aug. 22 vote on the premiership.

Senior Pheu Thai officials have said they are confident Srettha will prevail even without the support of Move Forward, the biggest party in parliament.

Philippines sees risk of conflict over Taiwan as a 'major concern',"Filipino soldiers stand at attention near a Philippine flag at Thitu island in disputed South China Sea April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Erik De Castro/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MANILA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Philippines seeks to bolster its ability to address threats while underlining the need to strengthen ties with allies while pursuing an independent foreign policy, under a six-year national security policy published on Tuesday.

The 48-page National Security Policy document, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr recently approved, highlighted ""sharpening strategic competition between the United States and China"" and ""heightened rivalries among the major powers"" as contributing to a ""more tense geopolitical landscape"".

""Major concern is also seen in the Cross-Straits relations that has the potential to be the flashpoint in the region,"" the government said in the document, published by the National Security Council, referring to the Taiwan Strait.

""The Philippines is concerned about its economic stability, a potential influx of refugees, and the welfare of overseas populations.""

Beijing, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, has been staging military exercises in the waters off the island to press its claim of sovereignty. The United States and allies such as Japan criticise such pressure on Taiwan.

""Any military conflict in the Taiwan Strait would inevitably affect the Philippines given the geographic proximity of Taiwan to the Philippine archipelago and the presence of over 150,000 Filipinos in Taiwan,"" the government said in the document.

The Philippines' northernmost islands are 190 km (118 miles) away from Taiwan.

The plan also covered government food and energy security priorities and noted that the South China Sea ""remains a primary national interest"".

""The divergences of claims ... claimants' methods of asserting their positions, continue to pose strategic challenges"" that endanger territorial integrity and people's rights, said the Philippines, which is in dispute with China over parts of the sea.

To achieve energy security, the government said it would explore development of offshore reserves, including in the South China Sea, to help reduce dependence on imports.

Ties with China have grown tense under Marcos, as the Philippines pivots back to traditional ally the United States.

The Philippines would strengthen a Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S., along with other existing mechanisms with regional partners, to ""achieve a credible defence capability"", it said.

"'I love England,' migrant says as he lands after boat crossing","DUNGENESS, England, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Dozens of men, women and children arrived on a shingle beach on the southern coast of England on Wednesday, tired but relieved to be brought ashore by a large orange lifeboat after making the risky sea crossing from France in rubber dinghies.

They are the latest among more than 2,000 migrants who have reached Britain from countries like Iran, Syria and Afghanistan just this month, encouraged by better weather to make the journey in their bid to claim asylum in the UK.

""I love England,"" one bearded man told a Reuters photographer, smiling, as he walked on the gravely beach in a black parka jacket. He said he was from Syria.

Two other men at the beach also said they were Syrian, having reached Britain after passing through Italy and France, while a teenager said he was from Kuwait and it had taken him one month to arrive.

The numbers arriving underscore the scale of the challenge facing British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his pledge to ""stop the boats"" as he prepares for a national election expected next year.

At the beach in Dungeness, amid blue skies and warm weather, migrants disembarked government and charity lifeboats to be taken by bus to the ferry port of Dover an hour away for processing by British authorities.

[1/5]People, believed to be migrants, walk in Dungeness, Britain, August 16, 2023. REUTERS/Toby Melville Acquire Licensing Rights

In total, at least 100 migrants arrived on small boats on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally from Dungeness and Dover.

Those arriving included many children, some barefoot, clutching blankets and walking hand in hand with their parents, or being carried by officials in high-vis jackets.

Almost 17,000 migrants have arrived so far this year, although that is less than during the same period last year. In total, nearly 46,000 migrants were detected arriving in small boats in 2022. Many will have likely paid people smugglers for their crossings, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.

Sunak has faced criticism from some of his own lawmakers for not moving quickly enough to crack down on illegal migration, which has been blamed in parts of the country for stretching public services, including the provision of accommodation.

He has signed deals with France and Turkey to stem the flow of migrants, and his government passed an illegal migration law which plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, although that plan has been bogged down in the courts.

At the moment, however, the flow of migrants shows little sign of slowing as more boats arrive on the southern English coast.

Last year, August represented the highest number of small boat arrivals for any month on record, while half of all migrants arrived during August-October.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India on Wednesday approved plans for a nearly 580 billion rupee ($7 billion) scheme to deploy 10,000 electric buses in 169 cities over a decade, along with charging and associated infrastructure facilities.

The federal government will fund 200 billion rupees of the cost of the scheme, based on a public-private partnership model, Information Minister Anurag Thakur said at a briefing.

It was not immediately clear whether the remaining funds would come from state governments or private companies.

Shares of companies that investors expect to benefit from the plan rose after the news. Electric bus makers Olectra Greentech (OLEC.NS) and JBM Auto (JBMA.NS) closed up 8.8% and 10.1% respectively.

Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) was up 1.9%, while Ashok Leyland, which has a unit that makes electric buses, pared a 2.5% rise to settle 0.9% higher.

The government’s push for electric public transportation vehicles comes as it works to cut emissions and reduce fuel imports, with companies offered incentives to build vehicles and parts in the country.

Pursuing plans for a eventual fleet of 50,000 electric buses nationwide, at an estimated cost of $12 billion, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been aggregating demand from state governments and issuing contracts or tenders inviting companies to bid.

New Delhi's monetary support to green the country's public transport comes at a time when bus makers have raised concerns about state transport corporations that have previously delayed payment for conventional buses. Having a dedicated fund will provide security to bus makers, allowing them to bid freely for government contracts, say analysts.

The cabinet also approved seven railway tracking projects worth 325 billion rupees to boost connectivity and mobility across nine states.

Nagorno-Karabakh residents say 'disastrous' blockade choking supplies,"Summary UN Security Council to discuss eight-month Karabakh blockade

Armenians may face genocide in Karabakh, says former ICC prosecutor

Azerbaijan says it needed to stop arms supplies from Armenia

TBILISI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh say it is getting harder to access food, medicines and other essential supplies as an Azerbaijani blockade of the breakaway region drags into its ninth month.

The U.N. Security Council will discuss the blockade on Wednesday, after a former International Criminal Court prosecutor this month said the blockade may amount to a ""genocide"" of the local Armenian population - an assertion that Azerbaijan's lawyers said was unsubstantiated and inaccurate.

Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but its population of 120,000 is overwhelmingly ethnic Armenian and the enclave's one remaining land link to Armenia, the Lachin corridor policed by Russian peacekeepers, was first disrupted in December.

Three residents of Karabakh said basic foodstuffs, fuel and medicine were almost exhausted.

""It's been a very long time since I've eaten any dairy produce, or eggs,"" Nina Shahverdyan, a 23-year-old English teacher, said in a video call with Reuters from the region's capital, which local Armenians call Stepanakert.

""It's been disastrous because we don't have gas. We have electricity blackouts.""

Armenia's foreign minister, Ararat Mirzoyan, discussed the situation in Karabakh on Wednesday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and stressed the need to avert a ""humanitarian disaster"" there, Russia's TASS state news agency reported.

Karabakh's population has tightened its belt since the blockade, eating only what can be produced locally.

The residents said even food produced within Karabakh itself is delivered only sporadically to Stepanakert, as farmers lack fuel to bring their products to market.

Ani Balayan, a recent high school graduate and photographer, said she had last eaten meat around two weeks ago. She said her family was surviving on bread, alongside the tomatoes, cucumbers and watermelon still available in Stepanakert's markets.

For some weeks, footage has shown Stepanakert's supermarket shelves bare, with little or nothing on sale.

""I went to bed hungry for several days because I could not find bread to bring home,"" Balayan said.

BREAKAWAY REGION

The crisis has highlighted how Russia, which is pre-occupied with the war in Ukraine, is struggling to project its influence in neighbouring post-Soviet states.

Karabakh was claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917, and broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the early 1990s.

In 2020, Azerbaijan retook territory in and around the enclave after a second war that ended in a Russia-brokered ceasefire. The agreement required Russia to ensure that road transport between Armenia and Karabakh remained open.

Since the ceasefire, road links between Armenia and Karabakh hinged on the Lachin corridor, which was blockaded in December by Azerbaijani civilians identifying themselves as ecological activists, while Russian peacekeepers did not intervene.

In April, Azerbaijani border guards installed a checkpoint on the route, tightening the blockade.

'GENOCIDE'?

This month, former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Luis Moreno Ocampo described the blockade as potentially constituting a ""genocide"" of Karabakh Armenians and intending ""to starve"" them.

Rodney Dixon, a lawyer appointed by Azerbaijan to give an assessment on Ocampo's opinion, called the view ""strikingly"" unsubstantiated, inflammatory and inaccurate.

Farhad Mammadov, the head of Baku's Centre for Studies of the South Caucasus think tank, said that controls on the road were necessary to prevent the transit of ""arms and Armenian soldiers"" to and from Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has said it is ready to open supplies to Karabakh via territory under its control, but that the separatist authorities must dissolve and integrate the region into Azerbaijan. The Armenian side has said that the blockade is aimed at forcing Karabakh into unconditional surrender to Baku.

English teacher Shahverdyan said: ""They are doing so that the people become… so desperate that they just simply leave"".

However, like other Karabakh Armenians who spoke to Reuters, Shahverdyan said it had only bolstered their determination to stay in their ancestral homeland.

""How can you live under a government or people who starve you for eight months?""

""Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral,"" she said.

Summary Move Forward refuses to back down

Pheu Thai confident will prevail in PM vote

Unclear if political newcomer Srettha can muster backing

Military wields big influence in legislature

BANGKOK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Thai lawmakers will vote for a new premier next week, the house speaker said on Wednesday, after a court rejected a bid by election winner Move Forward to challenge parliament's blocking of its candidate.

The Constitutional Court dismissed the petition by allies of the party on a technicality, arguing its prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjareonrat, who was twice thwarted by parliament, was not among the complainants.

Thailand has been under a caretaker administration since March and parliament has been deadlocked for weeks over the formation of the next government, after the anti-establishment Move Forward met fierce resistance from conservative lawmakers allied with the royalist military.

Move Forward was the surprise winner of the May election, riding on the back of huge youth and urban support for a liberal policy platform that took aim at some of Thailand's most powerful interest groups, including big business monopolies and the military.

The court's rejection was the latest in a succession of blows for Move Forward. Pita said the party would not give up its fight to govern.

""The problem is at parliament, so we will fix it in parliament,"" Pita said.

The Pheu Thai party, which was a close second in the election, withdrew its backing for Move Forward after Pita's re-nomination was rejected.

Pheu Thai, the populist electoral juggernaut of the billionaire Shinawatra family, is lobbying aggressively for support from conservative, army-backed lawmakers for its candidate, real estate tycoon Srettha Thavisin.

But it is far from certain whether the politically inexperienced Srettha has enough support from the elected lower house and the military-appointed Senate to become prime minister and form a government.

He needs the backing of half of the combined houses, a tough task given Pheu Thai's bitter history with the military and conservative establishment, which has intervened repeatedly to topple its governments during 17 years of on-off political turmoil.

""Whether the choosing of the prime minister will be completed on the day is up to the session,"" house speaker Wan Muhamad Noor Matha told reporters in announcing the Aug. 22 vote on the premiership.

Senior Pheu Thai officials have said they are confident Srettha will prevail even without the support of Move Forward, the biggest party in parliament.

Philippines sees risk of conflict over Taiwan as a 'major concern',"Filipino soldiers stand at attention near a Philippine flag at Thitu island in disputed South China Sea April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Erik De Castro/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MANILA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Philippines seeks to bolster its ability to address threats while underlining the need to strengthen ties with allies while pursuing an independent foreign policy, under a six-year national security policy published on Tuesday.

The 48-page National Security Policy document, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr recently approved, highlighted ""sharpening strategic competition between the United States and China"" and ""heightened rivalries among the major powers"" as contributing to a ""more tense geopolitical landscape"".

""Major concern is also seen in the Cross-Straits relations that has the potential to be the flashpoint in the region,"" the government said in the document, published by the National Security Council, referring to the Taiwan Strait.

""The Philippines is concerned about its economic stability, a potential influx of refugees, and the welfare of overseas populations.""

Beijing, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, has been staging military exercises in the waters off the island to press its claim of sovereignty. The United States and allies such as Japan criticise such pressure on Taiwan.

""Any military conflict in the Taiwan Strait would inevitably affect the Philippines given the geographic proximity of Taiwan to the Philippine archipelago and the presence of over 150,000 Filipinos in Taiwan,"" the government said in the document.

The Philippines' northernmost islands are 190 km (118 miles) away from Taiwan.

The plan also covered government food and energy security priorities and noted that the South China Sea ""remains a primary national interest"".

""The divergences of claims ... claimants' methods of asserting their positions, continue to pose strategic challenges"" that endanger territorial integrity and people's rights, said the Philippines, which is in dispute with China over parts of the sea.

To achieve energy security, the government said it would explore development of offshore reserves, including in the South China Sea, to help reduce dependence on imports.

Ties with China have grown tense under Marcos, as the Philippines pivots back to traditional ally the United States.

The Philippines would strengthen a Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S., along with other existing mechanisms with regional partners, to ""achieve a credible defence capability"", it said.

"'I love England,' migrant says as he lands after boat crossing","DUNGENESS, England, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Dozens of men, women and children arrived on a shingle beach on the southern coast of England on Wednesday, tired but relieved to be brought ashore by a large orange lifeboat after making the risky sea crossing from France in rubber dinghies.

They are the latest among more than 2,000 migrants who have reached Britain from countries like Iran, Syria and Afghanistan just this month, encouraged by better weather to make the journey in their bid to claim asylum in the UK.

""I love England,"" one bearded man told a Reuters photographer, smiling, as he walked on the gravely beach in a black parka jacket. He said he was from Syria.

Two other men at the beach also said they were Syrian, having reached Britain after passing through Italy and France, while a teenager said he was from Kuwait and it had taken him one month to arrive.

The numbers arriving underscore the scale of the challenge facing British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his pledge to ""stop the boats"" as he prepares for a national election expected next year.

At the beach in Dungeness, amid blue skies and warm weather, migrants disembarked government and charity lifeboats to be taken by bus to the ferry port of Dover an hour away for processing by British authorities.

[1/5]People, believed to be migrants, walk in Dungeness, Britain, August 16, 2023. REUTERS/Toby Melville Acquire Licensing Rights

In total, at least 100 migrants arrived on small boats on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally from Dungeness and Dover.

Those arriving included many children, some barefoot, clutching blankets and walking hand in hand with their parents, or being carried by officials in high-vis jackets.

Almost 17,000 migrants have arrived so far this year, although that is less than during the same period last year. In total, nearly 46,000 migrants were detected arriving in small boats in 2022. Many will have likely paid people smugglers for their crossings, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.

Sunak has faced criticism from some of his own lawmakers for not moving quickly enough to crack down on illegal migration, which has been blamed in parts of the country for stretching public services, including the provision of accommodation.

He has signed deals with France and Turkey to stem the flow of migrants, and his government passed an illegal migration law which plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, although that plan has been bogged down in the courts.

At the moment, however, the flow of migrants shows little sign of slowing as more boats arrive on the southern English coast.

Last year, August represented the highest number of small boat arrivals for any month on record, while half of all migrants arrived during August-October.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India on Wednesday approved plans for a nearly 580 billion rupee ($7 billion) scheme to deploy 10,000 electric buses in 169 cities over a decade, along with charging and associated infrastructure facilities.

The federal government will fund 200 billion rupees of the cost of the scheme, based on a public-private partnership model, Information Minister Anurag Thakur said at a briefing.

It was not immediately clear whether the remaining funds would come from state governments or private companies.

Shares of companies that investors expect to benefit from the plan rose after the news. Electric bus makers Olectra Greentech (OLEC.NS) and JBM Auto (JBMA.NS) closed up 8.8% and 10.1% respectively.

Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) was up 1.9%, while Ashok Leyland, which has a unit that makes electric buses, pared a 2.5% rise to settle 0.9% higher.

The government’s push for electric public transportation vehicles comes as it works to cut emissions and reduce fuel imports, with companies offered incentives to build vehicles and parts in the country.

Pursuing plans for a eventual fleet of 50,000 electric buses nationwide, at an estimated cost of $12 billion, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been aggregating demand from state governments and issuing contracts or tenders inviting companies to bid.

New Delhi's monetary support to green the country's public transport comes at a time when bus makers have raised concerns about state transport corporations that have previously delayed payment for conventional buses. Having a dedicated fund will provide security to bus makers, allowing them to bid freely for government contracts, say analysts.

The cabinet also approved seven railway tracking projects worth 325 billion rupees to boost connectivity and mobility across nine states.

"Prayers, terror and a race to escape as wildfire bore down on Hawaiian town","[1/5] Yadira Ulloa, 55, sits outside her daughter's home in Lahaina after her home was destroyed during the Lahaina fire on the island of Maui in Hawaii, U.S., August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

OLOWALU, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Yadira Ulloa was pumping gas near the apartment building where she lived on the western side of Maui when the winds kicked up, blowing shingles off the roof and propelling the wildfire that would soon incinerate her town of Lahaina.

The winds from a distant hurricane were so fierce they shook her car, and as the fire approached, Ulloa began to pray. Her teen daughter, she realized, was alone in their apartment.

""God guided me,"" she said as she recalled the day last Tuesday when a wildfire ripped apart her community. ""I went straight to my apartment and there was my daughter.""

""Let's go!"" Ulloa told her. ""We ran away.""

Racing down the stairs, seeing the blaze come closer, Ulloa began to cry. ""The fire didn't stop,"" she said. ""It came running.""

They climbed into Ulloa's blue truck and fled. The gas station, she later learned, exploded when the wildfire reached it, and the apartment building burned to the ground.

The inferno killed at least 101 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Ulloa, who works as a housekeeper, and her daughter found refuge with an older daughter in the village of Olowalu. But the 55-year-old has been barely able to eat or sleep in the days since. Like many here, she wishes there had been an emergency alert warning to spur people into leaving sooner.

Taxi driver Kiet Ma, 56, was at home as the fire bore down, just 50 feet (15 m) away from his house. His wife Daisy Luu, 56 and also a taxi driver, was out on the road somewhere in the swirling black smoke. He couldn't reach her because phone and electrical services were down.

Finally, at around 4:30 pm, he said, ""I decided it's time to run."" He followed a neighbor out as the fire bore down. Emergency sirens came on, he said, but their announcements blared evacuations for a different part of town. For two nights, he slept in his car outside the fire zone before joining his wife at her sister's home in Olowalu - the same home where Ulloa's daughter rented a room.

On Thursday, Ma and Luu went back to check on their home - it was gone. Twenty years of work, driving private taxis on the island, putting everything into their house, and there was nothing left. Luu showed a visitor before-and-after photos - a peaceful looking ranch-style suburban home, bounded by a fence on a property dotted with palm trees. And then rubble.

""All my life put in, and it's gone in a minute,"" she said.

China's fertility rate drops to record low 1.09 in 2022- state media,"HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's fertility rate is estimated to have dropped to a record low of 1.09 in 2022, the National Business Daily said on Tuesday, a figure likely to rattle authorities as they try to boost the country's declining number of new births.

The state-backed Daily said the figure from China's Population and Development Research Center put it as having the lowest fertility level among countries with a population of more than 100 million.

China's fertility rate is already one of the world's lowest alongside South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Concerned about China's first population drop in six decades and its rapid ageing population, Beijing is urgently trying an array of measures to lift the birth rate including financial incentives and improved childcare facilities.

President Xi Jinping in May presided over a meeting to study the topic.

China has said it will focus on education, science and technology to improve population quality and strive to maintain a ""moderate fertility"" level to support economic growth in future.

High childcare costs and having to stop their careers have put many women off having more children or any at all. Gender discrimination and traditional stereotypes of women caring for their children are still widespread throughout the country. Authorities have in recent months increased rhetoric on sharing the duty of child rearing but paternity leave is still limited in most provinces.

Hong Kong's Family Planning Association said in a separate release on Tuesday that the number of childless women in the special Chinese administrative region more than doubled from five years ago to 43.2% last year.

The percentage of couples with one or two children also tumbled while the average number of children per woman dropped from 1.3 in 2017 to a record low of 0.9 last year, according to its survey.

Summary

Companies Up to 80% Israeli tech startups registering in US - survey

Wealthy U.S. funds, pro-business policies are pull factors

Some cite uncertainty over Israeli judicial overhaul

JERUSALEM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A growing number of Israel's tech startups are incorporating in the United States, attracted by deep pocketed U.S. funds and pro-business policies, and with an extra push from a planned judicial overhaul at home that has rattled investors.

That marks a reversal, as Israel had managed in the past decade to persuade more of its startups to set up their legal identity domestically.

It may not mean jobs shifting overseas en masse - the tech sector accounts for 14% of Israeli jobs - but registering companies or intellectual property (IP) abroad can affect where taxes are paid and so impact government revenue.

Entrepreneurs and investors told Reuters there were good business reasons for incorporating in the United States, and particularly Delaware, which is considered pro-business and a tax haven as it has low corporate and no state sales taxes.

But some also cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, which his right-wing government says is needed to tackle over-reach by the courts but which critics view as an assault on democracy.

Though the overhaul does not directly affect the tech sector, Ian Amit, a former Israeli military officer, frets about its impact and is taking his startup across the Atlantic.

""It's just a very high level of uncertainty,"" said Amit, who is registering his artificial intelligence-based cloud security firm Gomboc in Delaware.

""It mainly really revolves around corruption and uncertainty of what system is there to protect me as a business, from a tax perspective, from a legal perspective or an intellectual property perspective,"" he said.

The economic risk for Israel's government is that its plans, which have sparked unprecedented nationwide protests, scare a tech industry that accounts for almost a fifth of the country's gross domestic product and about 30% of tax income. Some entrepreneurs already appear to be voting with their feet.

As many as 80% of new Israeli tech startups in 2023 have so far chosen to incorporate in Delaware, up from 20% in 2022, according to an Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) survey that also showed companies intend to register future IP overseas. IIA did not give the number of companies surveyed.

""The fact that you are shaking up the judicial system puts Israel in a very high level of uncertainty and investors don't like uncertainty,"" said IIA Chairman Ami Applebaum, who is also chief scientist at the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology.

Yair Geva, a partner who runs the tech group at law firm Herzog, Fox and Neeman, said that not only were new Israeli companies incorporating in Delaware, but some existing ones were expanding research and other operations outside of Israel.

""So, it's somewhat of a bigger issue than just the incorporation aspect of it,"" he said.

A survey of 615 firms by Startup Nation Central showed that 8% of Israeli startup/tech companies had started moving their headquarters abroad, and 29% intended to do so soon.

STARTUP NATION

Some entrepreneurs and investors said the decision to register in the United States was business, not political.

After all, Israel's tech sector relies heavily on foreign investment, and a drop in funding to startups following interest rate rises and the collapse of major tech investor Silicon Valley Bank may be encouraging firms to go where the money is.

""If you want to operate in a global world and you want American investors ... then that's the way it is,"" said Ronen Feldman, founder and CEO of ProntoNLP.ai. ""It's pure business.""

Tomer Tzach, CEO and co-founder of agri-tech company CropX, is considering switching incorporation to Delaware.

""At the end of the day as a CEO I need to do what's right for my shareholders, my investors, my company and I feel terrible about it,"" said Tzach.

Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based early-stage venture investor, has invested in more than a dozen Israeli startups since 2015. He insists on Delaware incorporation and existing Israeli startups seeking a new funding round from him must switch.

""It's better to have a Delaware C Corp from the beginning. It's true in all cases, without exception,"" he said.

But the Israeli government's judicial overhaul is casting a shadow for some.

Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and long-time investor in Israeli startups, has been happy to invest in Israeli-based tech firms over the past decade. He isn't forcing existing portfolio firms to switch but now recommends entrepreneurs incorporate in Delaware and open an Israeli unit.

""I don't view it as 'Israel's not good anymore'. We don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows. It is just uncertainty versus certainty,"" said Fisher.

Setting up shop in Delaware is mostly psychological, according to Ayal Shenhav, head of hi-tech and venture capital at law firm Gross & Co.

""It's not something concrete that you can say 'judges in Israel are corrupt'. No one is saying that,"" he said. ""It's just a feeling that it is not as stable as it used to be and a lot of people follow the crowd.""

Yaron Samid, managing partner of the TechAviv Founder Partners fund, said that for U.S. investors incorporating in Delaware removes ""one variant in a highly uncertain business of a startup"", but investment in Israeli startups would continue.

""Israel tech is not going anywhere,"" he said, ""because we have a an incredible bunch of talent that is producing more and more great companies, so whether they are structured as U.S. or Israeli corporations is really not significant for the tech ecosystem.""

China’s deflation a near-term positive for Western central banks - PIMCO,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Deflationary pressures in China could spill over into global markets, which is potentially near-term good news for Western central banks as they seek to curb inflation, U.S. asset manager PIMCO said on Wednesday.

China's consumer sector fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and a flurry of policies to support the economy failed to shore up activity.

The economic deterioration could moderate inflation in China and, increasingly, also in the markets served by Chinese goods, PIMCO Economist and Managing Director Tiffany Wilding said in a note.

""Persistent deflation in China would likely spill over to developed markets, as a weaker yuan and an elevated inventory-to-sales ratios lower the cost of Chinese goods abroad – a development central bankers in developed markets would likely welcome,"" she said.

“Given the usual lags, deflationary spillovers have likely only just begun to impact global consumer markets, with discounting likely to accelerate over the coming quarters.”

The Chinese central bank cut key policy rates on Tuesday for the second time in three months to boost the economy, but investors have so far been unimpressed.

Oxford Economics said in a note on Wednesday that it had reduced its 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast for China to a below-consensus 5.1%.

""Deflation, weakening trade, collapsing loan demand, and a paralysed property sector dampen our risk appetite,"" it said.

On Wednesday, data showed China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, as policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector.

Meanwhile, a senior official told investors that Zhongrong International Trust Co., a leading Chinese trust firm, had missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month, adding to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact in the financial sector.

""For China, the risk of more pronounced deflationary pressure depends crucially on the government’s policies in the coming months,"" said Wilding.

""Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral,"" she said.

"Prayers, terror and a race to escape as wildfire bore down on Hawaiian town","[1/5] Yadira Ulloa, 55, sits outside her daughter's home in Lahaina after her home was destroyed during the Lahaina fire on the island of Maui in Hawaii, U.S., August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

OLOWALU, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Yadira Ulloa was pumping gas near the apartment building where she lived on the western side of Maui when the winds kicked up, blowing shingles off the roof and propelling the wildfire that would soon incinerate her town of Lahaina.

The winds from a distant hurricane were so fierce they shook her car, and as the fire approached, Ulloa began to pray. Her teen daughter, she realized, was alone in their apartment.

""God guided me,"" she said as she recalled the day last Tuesday when a wildfire ripped apart her community. ""I went straight to my apartment and there was my daughter.""

""Let's go!"" Ulloa told her. ""We ran away.""

Racing down the stairs, seeing the blaze come closer, Ulloa began to cry. ""The fire didn't stop,"" she said. ""It came running.""

They climbed into Ulloa's blue truck and fled. The gas station, she later learned, exploded when the wildfire reached it, and the apartment building burned to the ground.

The inferno killed at least 101 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Ulloa, who works as a housekeeper, and her daughter found refuge with an older daughter in the village of Olowalu. But the 55-year-old has been barely able to eat or sleep in the days since. Like many here, she wishes there had been an emergency alert warning to spur people into leaving sooner.

Taxi driver Kiet Ma, 56, was at home as the fire bore down, just 50 feet (15 m) away from his house. His wife Daisy Luu, 56 and also a taxi driver, was out on the road somewhere in the swirling black smoke. He couldn't reach her because phone and electrical services were down.

Finally, at around 4:30 pm, he said, ""I decided it's time to run."" He followed a neighbor out as the fire bore down. Emergency sirens came on, he said, but their announcements blared evacuations for a different part of town. For two nights, he slept in his car outside the fire zone before joining his wife at her sister's home in Olowalu - the same home where Ulloa's daughter rented a room.

On Thursday, Ma and Luu went back to check on their home - it was gone. Twenty years of work, driving private taxis on the island, putting everything into their house, and there was nothing left. Luu showed a visitor before-and-after photos - a peaceful looking ranch-style suburban home, bounded by a fence on a property dotted with palm trees. And then rubble.

""All my life put in, and it's gone in a minute,"" she said.

Yield gap between China and US widens to highest since 2007 after surprise rate cut,"A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Yield differentials between China and the U.S. widened to their highest in 16 years on Wednesday, as investors speculated that China's central bank would ease monetary policy further after a surprise rate cut, even if it puts the yuan under pressure.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly cut key policy rates for the second time in three months on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that the authorities are ramping up monetary easing efforts to boost a sputtering economic recovery. And markets widely expect the PBOC to loosen monetary policy further.

Earlier in the session, the PBOC also ramped up liquidity injection by offering the most short-term cash through seven-day reverse repos in open market operations since February.

China remains an outlier among global central banks as it has loosened monetary policy to shore up a stalling recovery whereas others, particularly the United States, have been in tightening cycles as they battle high inflation.

But the divergent monetary policy paths between the world's two largest economies widened the yield gap to 164 basis points between China's benchmark 10-year government bonds and U.S Treasuries s - the highest since February 2007.

""The significant yield gap, the largest since 2007, could be a key reason why capital remains planted in US dollars and US Treasuries for the time being,"" said David Chao, global market strategist at Asia Pacific at Invesco.

""More broadly, recent economic data releases in China have been disappointing, while those in the U.S. have surprised to the upside.""

The widening yield gap reduced foreign appetite in China's onshore yuan bonds, with latest official data showing overseas investors' holding declined in July.

Tumbling credit growth and rising deflation risks in July warranted more monetary easing measures to arrest the slowdown, market watchers said, while default risks at some major property developers and missed payments by a private wealth manager also hurt confidence in China's financial markets.

In derivatives market, one-year interest rate swaps , a gauge that measures investor expectations of future funding costs, fell to 1.84% this week, the lowest since September 2022, suggesting some market participants are pricing in further rate reductions.

But the expectations for further monetary easing and capital outflow risks has pressure on the Chinese yuan to depreciate further. The yuan has lost about 5.5% against the dollar since the start of the year, making it one of the worst performing Asian currencies.

""The PBOC will need to do more to manage the pace of yuan depreciation,"" Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB, said in a note.

Summary

Companies Up to 80% Israeli tech startups registering in US - survey

Wealthy U.S. funds, pro-business policies are pull factors

Some cite uncertainty over Israeli judicial overhaul

JERUSALEM, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A growing number of Israel's tech startups are incorporating in the United States, attracted by deep pocketed U.S. funds and pro-business policies, and with an extra push from a planned judicial overhaul at home that has rattled investors.

That marks a reversal, as Israel had managed in the past decade to persuade more of its startups to set up their legal identity domestically.

It may not mean jobs shifting overseas en masse - the tech sector accounts for 14% of Israeli jobs - but registering companies or intellectual property (IP) abroad can affect where taxes are paid and so impact government revenue.

Entrepreneurs and investors told Reuters there were good business reasons for incorporating in the United States, and particularly Delaware, which is considered pro-business and a tax haven as it has low corporate and no state sales taxes.

But some also cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul, which his right-wing government says is needed to tackle over-reach by the courts but which critics view as an assault on democracy.

Though the overhaul does not directly affect the tech sector, Ian Amit, a former Israeli military officer, frets about its impact and is taking his startup across the Atlantic.

""It's just a very high level of uncertainty,"" said Amit, who is registering his artificial intelligence-based cloud security firm Gomboc in Delaware.

""It mainly really revolves around corruption and uncertainty of what system is there to protect me as a business, from a tax perspective, from a legal perspective or an intellectual property perspective,"" he said.

The economic risk for Israel's government is that its plans, which have sparked unprecedented nationwide protests, scare a tech industry that accounts for almost a fifth of the country's gross domestic product and about 30% of tax income. Some entrepreneurs already appear to be voting with their feet.

As many as 80% of new Israeli tech startups in 2023 have so far chosen to incorporate in Delaware, up from 20% in 2022, according to an Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) survey that also showed companies intend to register future IP overseas. IIA did not give the number of companies surveyed.

""The fact that you are shaking up the judicial system puts Israel in a very high level of uncertainty and investors don't like uncertainty,"" said IIA Chairman Ami Applebaum, who is also chief scientist at the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology.

Yair Geva, a partner who runs the tech group at law firm Herzog, Fox and Neeman, said that not only were new Israeli companies incorporating in Delaware, but some existing ones were expanding research and other operations outside of Israel.

""So, it's somewhat of a bigger issue than just the incorporation aspect of it,"" he said.

A survey of 615 firms by Startup Nation Central showed that 8% of Israeli startup/tech companies had started moving their headquarters abroad, and 29% intended to do so soon.

STARTUP NATION

Some entrepreneurs and investors said the decision to register in the United States was business, not political.

After all, Israel's tech sector relies heavily on foreign investment, and a drop in funding to startups following interest rate rises and the collapse of major tech investor Silicon Valley Bank may be encouraging firms to go where the money is.

""If you want to operate in a global world and you want American investors ... then that's the way it is,"" said Ronen Feldman, founder and CEO of ProntoNLP.ai. ""It's pure business.""

Tomer Tzach, CEO and co-founder of agri-tech company CropX, is considering switching incorporation to Delaware.

""At the end of the day as a CEO I need to do what's right for my shareholders, my investors, my company and I feel terrible about it,"" said Tzach.

Michael Fertik, founder of Heroic Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based early-stage venture investor, has invested in more than a dozen Israeli startups since 2015. He insists on Delaware incorporation and existing Israeli startups seeking a new funding round from him must switch.

""It's better to have a Delaware C Corp from the beginning. It's true in all cases, without exception,"" he said.

But the Israeli government's judicial overhaul is casting a shadow for some.

Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners and long-time investor in Israeli startups, has been happy to invest in Israeli-based tech firms over the past decade. He isn't forcing existing portfolio firms to switch but now recommends entrepreneurs incorporate in Delaware and open an Israeli unit.

""I don't view it as 'Israel's not good anymore'. We don't know what's going to happen. Nobody knows. It is just uncertainty versus certainty,"" said Fisher.

Setting up shop in Delaware is mostly psychological, according to Ayal Shenhav, head of hi-tech and venture capital at law firm Gross & Co.

""It's not something concrete that you can say 'judges in Israel are corrupt'. No one is saying that,"" he said. ""It's just a feeling that it is not as stable as it used to be and a lot of people follow the crowd.""

Yaron Samid, managing partner of the TechAviv Founder Partners fund, said that for U.S. investors incorporating in Delaware removes ""one variant in a highly uncertain business of a startup"", but investment in Israeli startups would continue.

""Israel tech is not going anywhere,"" he said, ""because we have a an incredible bunch of talent that is producing more and more great companies, so whether they are structured as U.S. or Israeli corporations is really not significant for the tech ecosystem.""

China’s deflation a near-term positive for Western central banks - PIMCO,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Deflationary pressures in China could spill over into global markets, which is potentially near-term good news for Western central banks as they seek to curb inflation, U.S. asset manager PIMCO said on Wednesday.

China's consumer sector fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and a flurry of policies to support the economy failed to shore up activity.

The economic deterioration could moderate inflation in China and, increasingly, also in the markets served by Chinese goods, PIMCO Economist and Managing Director Tiffany Wilding said in a note.

""Persistent deflation in China would likely spill over to developed markets, as a weaker yuan and an elevated inventory-to-sales ratios lower the cost of Chinese goods abroad – a development central bankers in developed markets would likely welcome,"" she said.

“Given the usual lags, deflationary spillovers have likely only just begun to impact global consumer markets, with discounting likely to accelerate over the coming quarters.”

The Chinese central bank cut key policy rates on Tuesday for the second time in three months to boost the economy, but investors have so far been unimpressed.

Oxford Economics said in a note on Wednesday that it had reduced its 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast for China to a below-consensus 5.1%.

""Deflation, weakening trade, collapsing loan demand, and a paralysed property sector dampen our risk appetite,"" it said.

On Wednesday, data showed China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, as policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector.

Meanwhile, a senior official told investors that Zhongrong International Trust Co., a leading Chinese trust firm, had missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month, adding to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact in the financial sector.

""For China, the risk of more pronounced deflationary pressure depends crucially on the government’s policies in the coming months,"" said Wilding.

""Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral,"" she said.

Thai lawmakers to vote on PM next week in bid to end deadlock,"Move Forward Party Leader Pita Limjaroenrat looks on at a voting session for a new prime minister at the parliament, in Bangkok, Thailand, July 13, 2023. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Summary Move Forward refuses to back down

Pheu Thai confident will prevail in PM vote

Unclear if political newcomer Srettha can muster backing

Military wields big influence in legislature

BANGKOK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Thai lawmakers will vote for a new premier next week, the house speaker said on Wednesday, after a court rejected a bid by election winner Move Forward to challenge parliament's blocking of its candidate.

The Constitutional Court dismissed the petition by allies of the party on a technicality, arguing its prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjareonrat, who was twice thwarted by parliament, was not among the complainants.

Thailand has been under a caretaker administration since March and parliament has been deadlocked for weeks over the formation of the next government, after the anti-establishment Move Forward met fierce resistance from conservative lawmakers allied with the royalist military.

Move Forward was the surprise winner of the May election, riding on the back of huge youth and urban support for a liberal policy platform that took aim at some of Thailand's most powerful interest groups, including big business monopolies and the military.

The court's rejection was the latest in a succession of blows for Move Forward. Pita said the party would not give up its fight to govern.

""The problem is at parliament, so we will fix it in parliament,"" Pita said.

The Pheu Thai party, which was a close second in the election, withdrew its backing for Move Forward after Pita's re-nomination was rejected.

Pheu Thai, the populist electoral juggernaut of the billionaire Shinawatra family, is lobbying aggressively for support from conservative, army-backed lawmakers for its candidate, real estate tycoon Srettha Thavisin.

But it is far from certain whether the politically inexperienced Srettha has enough support from the elected lower house and the military-appointed Senate to become prime minister and form a government.

He needs the backing of half of the combined houses, a tough task given Pheu Thai's bitter history with the military and conservative establishment, which has intervened repeatedly to topple its governments during 17 years of on-off political turmoil.

""Whether the choosing of the prime minister will be completed on the day is up to the session,"" house speaker Wan Muhamad Noor Matha told reporters in announcing the Aug. 22 vote on the premiership.

Senior Pheu Thai officials have said they are confident Srettha will prevail even without the support of Move Forward, the biggest party in parliament.

Philippines sees risk of conflict over Taiwan as a 'major concern',"Filipino soldiers stand at attention near a Philippine flag at Thitu island in disputed South China Sea April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Erik De Castro/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MANILA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Philippines seeks to bolster its ability to address threats while underlining the need to strengthen ties with allies while pursuing an independent foreign policy, under a six-year national security policy published on Tuesday.

The 48-page National Security Policy document, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr recently approved, highlighted ""sharpening strategic competition between the United States and China"" and ""heightened rivalries among the major powers"" as contributing to a ""more tense geopolitical landscape"".

""Major concern is also seen in the Cross-Straits relations that has the potential to be the flashpoint in the region,"" the government said in the document, published by the National Security Council, referring to the Taiwan Strait.

""The Philippines is concerned about its economic stability, a potential influx of refugees, and the welfare of overseas populations.""

Beijing, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, has been staging military exercises in the waters off the island to press its claim of sovereignty. The United States and allies such as Japan criticise such pressure on Taiwan.

""Any military conflict in the Taiwan Strait would inevitably affect the Philippines given the geographic proximity of Taiwan to the Philippine archipelago and the presence of over 150,000 Filipinos in Taiwan,"" the government said in the document.

The Philippines' northernmost islands are 190 km (118 miles) away from Taiwan.

The plan also covered government food and energy security priorities and noted that the South China Sea ""remains a primary national interest"".

""The divergences of claims ... claimants' methods of asserting their positions, continue to pose strategic challenges"" that endanger territorial integrity and people's rights, said the Philippines, which is in dispute with China over parts of the sea.

To achieve energy security, the government said it would explore development of offshore reserves, including in the South China Sea, to help reduce dependence on imports.

Ties with China have grown tense under Marcos, as the Philippines pivots back to traditional ally the United States.

The Philippines would strengthen a Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S., along with other existing mechanisms with regional partners, to ""achieve a credible defence capability"", it said.

"'I love England,' migrant says as he lands after boat crossing","DUNGENESS, England, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Dozens of men, women and children arrived on a shingle beach on the southern coast of England on Wednesday, tired but relieved to be brought ashore by a large orange lifeboat after making the risky sea crossing from France in rubber dinghies.

They are the latest among more than 2,000 migrants who have reached Britain from countries like Iran, Syria and Afghanistan just this month, encouraged by better weather to make the journey in their bid to claim asylum in the UK.

""I love England,"" one bearded man told a Reuters photographer, smiling, as he walked on the gravely beach in a black parka jacket. He said he was from Syria.

Two other men at the beach also said they were Syrian, having reached Britain after passing through Italy and France, while a teenager said he was from Kuwait and it had taken him one month to arrive.

The numbers arriving underscore the scale of the challenge facing British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his pledge to ""stop the boats"" as he prepares for a national election expected next year.

At the beach in Dungeness, amid blue skies and warm weather, migrants disembarked government and charity lifeboats to be taken by bus to the ferry port of Dover an hour away for processing by British authorities.

[1/5]People, believed to be migrants, walk in Dungeness, Britain, August 16, 2023. REUTERS/Toby Melville Acquire Licensing Rights

In total, at least 100 migrants arrived on small boats on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally from Dungeness and Dover.

Those arriving included many children, some barefoot, clutching blankets and walking hand in hand with their parents, or being carried by officials in high-vis jackets.

Almost 17,000 migrants have arrived so far this year, although that is less than during the same period last year. In total, nearly 46,000 migrants were detected arriving in small boats in 2022. Many will have likely paid people smugglers for their crossings, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.

Sunak has faced criticism from some of his own lawmakers for not moving quickly enough to crack down on illegal migration, which has been blamed in parts of the country for stretching public services, including the provision of accommodation.

He has signed deals with France and Turkey to stem the flow of migrants, and his government passed an illegal migration law which plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, although that plan has been bogged down in the courts.

At the moment, however, the flow of migrants shows little sign of slowing as more boats arrive on the southern English coast.

Last year, August represented the highest number of small boat arrivals for any month on record, while half of all migrants arrived during August-October.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India on Wednesday approved plans for a nearly 580 billion rupee ($7 billion) scheme to deploy 10,000 electric buses in 169 cities over a decade, along with charging and associated infrastructure facilities.

The federal government will fund 200 billion rupees of the cost of the scheme, based on a public-private partnership model, Information Minister Anurag Thakur said at a briefing.

It was not immediately clear whether the remaining funds would come from state governments or private companies.

Shares of companies that investors expect to benefit from the plan rose after the news. Electric bus makers Olectra Greentech (OLEC.NS) and JBM Auto (JBMA.NS) closed up 8.8% and 10.1% respectively.

Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) was up 1.9%, while Ashok Leyland, which has a unit that makes electric buses, pared a 2.5% rise to settle 0.9% higher.

The government’s push for electric public transportation vehicles comes as it works to cut emissions and reduce fuel imports, with companies offered incentives to build vehicles and parts in the country.

Pursuing plans for a eventual fleet of 50,000 electric buses nationwide, at an estimated cost of $12 billion, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been aggregating demand from state governments and issuing contracts or tenders inviting companies to bid.

New Delhi's monetary support to green the country's public transport comes at a time when bus makers have raised concerns about state transport corporations that have previously delayed payment for conventional buses. Having a dedicated fund will provide security to bus makers, allowing them to bid freely for government contracts, say analysts.

The cabinet also approved seven railway tracking projects worth 325 billion rupees to boost connectivity and mobility across nine states.

US would welcome any Iranian steps to slow nuclear program,"WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday he could not confirm a report that Iran slowed its pace of amassing near-weapons-grade enriched uranium but would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

Blinken also told reporters that Iran moving U.S. detainees into house arrest was not related to any other aspect of U.S. policy toward Iran, which he said reflected a strategy of deterrence, pressure and diplomacy.

On Thursday, sources said Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from prison. A fifth was already under home confinement.

The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported Iran had significantly slowed the pace at which it was accumulating near-weapons-grade enriched uranium and diluted some of its stockpile, moves that could help ease tensions with the U.S. and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program.

""Of course, we would welcome any steps that Iran takes to actually deescalate the growing nuclear threat that it has posed since the United States got out of the Iran nuclear deal,"" Blinken told a news conference, alluding to former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 abandonment of that agreement.

Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and six major powers, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear program to make it harder for it to obtain an atomic weapon - an ambition it denies - in return for relief from U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Iranian-American writer Roya Hakakian, Iranian-American activist Sherry Hakimi and British-Iranian actress and activist Nazanin Boniadi to discuss the recent protests in Iran at the U.S. State Department in Washington, U.S., October 14, 2022. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

When asked if Iran's reported slowdown and the release of the detainees to house arrest was in any way linked, Blinken said they were different issues. ""The agreement that we're pursuing to bring home those who are wrongfully detained in Iran is an entirely separate matter that we want to bring to a successful conclusion, and that's what I'm focused on.""

WRONGFULLY DETAINED

The deal announced last week has left out Shahab Dalili, 60, a U.S. permanent resident who has been detained in Iran since 2016, even though his family have repeatedly pleaded with the Biden administration to include him in the deal or at least label him ""wrongfully detained"".

Dalili has started a hunger strike in the Evin prison in Iran where he has been jailed, his son said on Monday.

The State Department makes the legal determination of wrongful detainment, which effectively means the U.S. government views the charges as politically motivated and false.

Blinken emphasized that the agreement included U.S. citizens who have all been designated as wrongfully detained and said Washington would continue to examine other cases.

""For reasons of privacy, I can't talk about any individual cases. I can simply say that as a matter of policy, we're constantly reviewing whether any particular individual, whether an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, who was incarcerated in another country is wrongfully detained,"" he said.

China’s deflation a near-term positive for Western central banks - PIMCO,"NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Deflationary pressures in China could spill over into global markets, which is potentially near-term good news for Western central banks as they seek to curb inflation, U.S. asset manager PIMCO said on Wednesday.

China's consumer sector fell into deflation and factory-gate prices extended declines in July, as the world's second-largest economy struggled to revive demand and a flurry of policies to support the economy failed to shore up activity.

The economic deterioration could moderate inflation in China and, increasingly, also in the markets served by Chinese goods, PIMCO Economist and Managing Director Tiffany Wilding said in a note.

""Persistent deflation in China would likely spill over to developed markets, as a weaker yuan and an elevated inventory-to-sales ratios lower the cost of Chinese goods abroad – a development central bankers in developed markets would likely welcome,"" she said.

“Given the usual lags, deflationary spillovers have likely only just begun to impact global consumer markets, with discounting likely to accelerate over the coming quarters.”

The Chinese central bank cut key policy rates on Tuesday for the second time in three months to boost the economy, but investors have so far been unimpressed.

Oxford Economics said in a note on Wednesday that it had reduced its 2023 gross domestic product growth forecast for China to a below-consensus 5.1%.

""Deflation, weakening trade, collapsing loan demand, and a paralysed property sector dampen our risk appetite,"" it said.

On Wednesday, data showed China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, as policy support failed to shore up the embattled property sector.

Meanwhile, a senior official told investors that Zhongrong International Trust Co., a leading Chinese trust firm, had missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month, adding to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact in the financial sector.

""For China, the risk of more pronounced deflationary pressure depends crucially on the government’s policies in the coming months,"" said Wilding.

""Adequate fiscal stimulus to boost domestic demand may reaccelerate inflation, while delayed or inadequate policy measures could lead to a downward spiral,"" she said.

Thai lawmakers to vote on PM next week in bid to end deadlock,"Move Forward Party Leader Pita Limjaroenrat looks on at a voting session for a new prime minister at the parliament, in Bangkok, Thailand, July 13, 2023. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Summary Move Forward refuses to back down

Pheu Thai confident will prevail in PM vote

Unclear if political newcomer Srettha can muster backing

Military wields big influence in legislature

BANGKOK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Thai lawmakers will vote for a new premier next week, the house speaker said on Wednesday, after a court rejected a bid by election winner Move Forward to challenge parliament's blocking of its candidate.

The Constitutional Court dismissed the petition by allies of the party on a technicality, arguing its prime ministerial candidate, Pita Limjareonrat, who was twice thwarted by parliament, was not among the complainants.

Thailand has been under a caretaker administration since March and parliament has been deadlocked for weeks over the formation of the next government, after the anti-establishment Move Forward met fierce resistance from conservative lawmakers allied with the royalist military.

Move Forward was the surprise winner of the May election, riding on the back of huge youth and urban support for a liberal policy platform that took aim at some of Thailand's most powerful interest groups, including big business monopolies and the military.

The court's rejection was the latest in a succession of blows for Move Forward. Pita said the party would not give up its fight to govern.

""The problem is at parliament, so we will fix it in parliament,"" Pita said.

The Pheu Thai party, which was a close second in the election, withdrew its backing for Move Forward after Pita's re-nomination was rejected.

Pheu Thai, the populist electoral juggernaut of the billionaire Shinawatra family, is lobbying aggressively for support from conservative, army-backed lawmakers for its candidate, real estate tycoon Srettha Thavisin.

But it is far from certain whether the politically inexperienced Srettha has enough support from the elected lower house and the military-appointed Senate to become prime minister and form a government.

He needs the backing of half of the combined houses, a tough task given Pheu Thai's bitter history with the military and conservative establishment, which has intervened repeatedly to topple its governments during 17 years of on-off political turmoil.

""Whether the choosing of the prime minister will be completed on the day is up to the session,"" house speaker Wan Muhamad Noor Matha told reporters in announcing the Aug. 22 vote on the premiership.

Senior Pheu Thai officials have said they are confident Srettha will prevail even without the support of Move Forward, the biggest party in parliament.

Philippines sees risk of conflict over Taiwan as a 'major concern',"Filipino soldiers stand at attention near a Philippine flag at Thitu island in disputed South China Sea April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Erik De Castro/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MANILA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Philippines seeks to bolster its ability to address threats while underlining the need to strengthen ties with allies while pursuing an independent foreign policy, under a six-year national security policy published on Tuesday.

The 48-page National Security Policy document, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr recently approved, highlighted ""sharpening strategic competition between the United States and China"" and ""heightened rivalries among the major powers"" as contributing to a ""more tense geopolitical landscape"".

""Major concern is also seen in the Cross-Straits relations that has the potential to be the flashpoint in the region,"" the government said in the document, published by the National Security Council, referring to the Taiwan Strait.

""The Philippines is concerned about its economic stability, a potential influx of refugees, and the welfare of overseas populations.""

Beijing, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, has been staging military exercises in the waters off the island to press its claim of sovereignty. The United States and allies such as Japan criticise such pressure on Taiwan.

""Any military conflict in the Taiwan Strait would inevitably affect the Philippines given the geographic proximity of Taiwan to the Philippine archipelago and the presence of over 150,000 Filipinos in Taiwan,"" the government said in the document.

The Philippines' northernmost islands are 190 km (118 miles) away from Taiwan.

The plan also covered government food and energy security priorities and noted that the South China Sea ""remains a primary national interest"".

""The divergences of claims ... claimants' methods of asserting their positions, continue to pose strategic challenges"" that endanger territorial integrity and people's rights, said the Philippines, which is in dispute with China over parts of the sea.

To achieve energy security, the government said it would explore development of offshore reserves, including in the South China Sea, to help reduce dependence on imports.

Ties with China have grown tense under Marcos, as the Philippines pivots back to traditional ally the United States.

The Philippines would strengthen a Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S., along with other existing mechanisms with regional partners, to ""achieve a credible defence capability"", it said.

"'I love England,' migrant says as he lands after boat crossing","DUNGENESS, England, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Dozens of men, women and children arrived on a shingle beach on the southern coast of England on Wednesday, tired but relieved to be brought ashore by a large orange lifeboat after making the risky sea crossing from France in rubber dinghies.

They are the latest among more than 2,000 migrants who have reached Britain from countries like Iran, Syria and Afghanistan just this month, encouraged by better weather to make the journey in their bid to claim asylum in the UK.

""I love England,"" one bearded man told a Reuters photographer, smiling, as he walked on the gravely beach in a black parka jacket. He said he was from Syria.

Two other men at the beach also said they were Syrian, having reached Britain after passing through Italy and France, while a teenager said he was from Kuwait and it had taken him one month to arrive.

The numbers arriving underscore the scale of the challenge facing British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his pledge to ""stop the boats"" as he prepares for a national election expected next year.

At the beach in Dungeness, amid blue skies and warm weather, migrants disembarked government and charity lifeboats to be taken by bus to the ferry port of Dover an hour away for processing by British authorities.

[1/5]People, believed to be migrants, walk in Dungeness, Britain, August 16, 2023. REUTERS/Toby Melville Acquire Licensing Rights

In total, at least 100 migrants arrived on small boats on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally from Dungeness and Dover.

Those arriving included many children, some barefoot, clutching blankets and walking hand in hand with their parents, or being carried by officials in high-vis jackets.

Almost 17,000 migrants have arrived so far this year, although that is less than during the same period last year. In total, nearly 46,000 migrants were detected arriving in small boats in 2022. Many will have likely paid people smugglers for their crossings, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.

Sunak has faced criticism from some of his own lawmakers for not moving quickly enough to crack down on illegal migration, which has been blamed in parts of the country for stretching public services, including the provision of accommodation.

He has signed deals with France and Turkey to stem the flow of migrants, and his government passed an illegal migration law which plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, although that plan has been bogged down in the courts.

At the moment, however, the flow of migrants shows little sign of slowing as more boats arrive on the southern English coast.

Last year, August represented the highest number of small boat arrivals for any month on record, while half of all migrants arrived during August-October.

India approves $7 bln plan for electric buses in nearly 170 cities,"Traffic moves in front of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) building and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) as they are lit up in the colours of India's national flag ahead of the 75th Independence Day celebrations, in Mumbai, India, August 13, 2022. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India on Wednesday approved plans for a nearly 580 billion rupee ($7 billion) scheme to deploy 10,000 electric buses in 169 cities over a decade, along with charging and associated infrastructure facilities.

The federal government will fund 200 billion rupees of the cost of the scheme, based on a public-private partnership model, Information Minister Anurag Thakur said at a briefing.

It was not immediately clear whether the remaining funds would come from state governments or private companies.

Shares of companies that investors expect to benefit from the plan rose after the news. Electric bus makers Olectra Greentech (OLEC.NS) and JBM Auto (JBMA.NS) closed up 8.8% and 10.1% respectively.

Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) was up 1.9%, while Ashok Leyland, which has a unit that makes electric buses, pared a 2.5% rise to settle 0.9% higher.

The government’s push for electric public transportation vehicles comes as it works to cut emissions and reduce fuel imports, with companies offered incentives to build vehicles and parts in the country.

Pursuing plans for a eventual fleet of 50,000 electric buses nationwide, at an estimated cost of $12 billion, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been aggregating demand from state governments and issuing contracts or tenders inviting companies to bid.

New Delhi's monetary support to green the country's public transport comes at a time when bus makers have raised concerns about state transport corporations that have previously delayed payment for conventional buses. Having a dedicated fund will provide security to bus makers, allowing them to bid freely for government contracts, say analysts.

The cabinet also approved seven railway tracking projects worth 325 billion rupees to boost connectivity and mobility across nine states.

"Prayers, terror and a race to escape as wildfire bore down on Hawaiian town","[1/5] Yadira Ulloa, 55, sits outside her daughter's home in Lahaina after her home was destroyed during the Lahaina fire on the island of Maui in Hawaii, U.S., August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

OLOWALU, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Yadira Ulloa was pumping gas near the apartment building where she lived on the western side of Maui when the winds kicked up, blowing shingles off the roof and propelling the wildfire that would soon incinerate her town of Lahaina.

The winds from a distant hurricane were so fierce they shook her car, and as the fire approached, Ulloa began to pray. Her teen daughter, she realized, was alone in their apartment.

""God guided me,"" she said as she recalled the day last Tuesday when a wildfire ripped apart her community. ""I went straight to my apartment and there was my daughter.""

""Let's go!"" Ulloa told her. ""We ran away.""

Racing down the stairs, seeing the blaze come closer, Ulloa began to cry. ""The fire didn't stop,"" she said. ""It came running.""

They climbed into Ulloa's blue truck and fled. The gas station, she later learned, exploded when the wildfire reached it, and the apartment building burned to the ground.

The inferno killed at least 101 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Ulloa, who works as a housekeeper, and her daughter found refuge with an older daughter in the village of Olowalu. But the 55-year-old has been barely able to eat or sleep in the days since. Like many here, she wishes there had been an emergency alert warning to spur people into leaving sooner.

Taxi driver Kiet Ma, 56, was at home as the fire bore down, just 50 feet (15 m) away from his house. His wife Daisy Luu, 56 and also a taxi driver, was out on the road somewhere in the swirling black smoke. He couldn't reach her because phone and electrical services were down.

Finally, at around 4:30 pm, he said, ""I decided it's time to run."" He followed a neighbor out as the fire bore down. Emergency sirens came on, he said, but their announcements blared evacuations for a different part of town. For two nights, he slept in his car outside the fire zone before joining his wife at her sister's home in Olowalu - the same home where Ulloa's daughter rented a room.

On Thursday, Ma and Luu went back to check on their home - it was gone. Twenty years of work, driving private taxis on the island, putting everything into their house, and there was nothing left. Luu showed a visitor before-and-after photos - a peaceful looking ranch-style suburban home, bounded by a fence on a property dotted with palm trees. And then rubble.

""All my life put in, and it's gone in a minute,"" she said.

Yield gap between China and US widens to highest since 2007 after surprise rate cut,"A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Yield differentials between China and the U.S. widened to their highest in 16 years on Wednesday, as investors speculated that China's central bank would ease monetary policy further after a surprise rate cut, even if it puts the yuan under pressure.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly cut key policy rates for the second time in three months on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that the authorities are ramping up monetary easing efforts to boost a sputtering economic recovery. And markets widely expect the PBOC to loosen monetary policy further.

Earlier in the session, the PBOC also ramped up liquidity injection by offering the most short-term cash through seven-day reverse repos in open market operations since February.

China remains an outlier among global central banks as it has loosened monetary policy to shore up a stalling recovery whereas others, particularly the United States, have been in tightening cycles as they battle high inflation.

But the divergent monetary policy paths between the world's two largest economies widened the yield gap to 164 basis points between China's benchmark 10-year government bonds and U.S Treasuries s - the highest since February 2007.

""The significant yield gap, the largest since 2007, could be a key reason why capital remains planted in US dollars and US Treasuries for the time being,"" said David Chao, global market strategist at Asia Pacific at Invesco.

""More broadly, recent economic data releases in China have been disappointing, while those in the U.S. have surprised to the upside.""

The widening yield gap reduced foreign appetite in China's onshore yuan bonds, with latest official data showing overseas investors' holding declined in July.

Tumbling credit growth and rising deflation risks in July warranted more monetary easing measures to arrest the slowdown, market watchers said, while default risks at some major property developers and missed payments by a private wealth manager also hurt confidence in China's financial markets.

In derivatives market, one-year interest rate swaps , a gauge that measures investor expectations of future funding costs, fell to 1.84% this week, the lowest since September 2022, suggesting some market participants are pricing in further rate reductions.

But the expectations for further monetary easing and capital outflow risks has pressure on the Chinese yuan to depreciate further. The yuan has lost about 5.5% against the dollar since the start of the year, making it one of the worst performing Asian currencies.

""The PBOC will need to do more to manage the pace of yuan depreciation,"" Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB, said in a note.

US would welcome any Iranian steps to slow nuclear program,"WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday he could not confirm a report that Iran slowed its pace of amassing near-weapons-grade enriched uranium but would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

Blinken also told reporters that Iran moving U.S. detainees into house arrest was not related to any other aspect of U.S. policy toward Iran, which he said reflected a strategy of deterrence, pressure and diplomacy.

On Thursday, sources said Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from prison. A fifth was already under home confinement.

The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported Iran had significantly slowed the pace at which it was accumulating near-weapons-grade enriched uranium and diluted some of its stockpile, moves that could help ease tensions with the U.S. and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program.

""Of course, we would welcome any steps that Iran takes to actually deescalate the growing nuclear threat that it has posed since the United States got out of the Iran nuclear deal,"" Blinken told a news conference, alluding to former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 abandonment of that agreement.

Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and six major powers, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear program to make it harder for it to obtain an atomic weapon - an ambition it denies - in return for relief from U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Iranian-American writer Roya Hakakian, Iranian-American activist Sherry Hakimi and British-Iranian actress and activist Nazanin Boniadi to discuss the recent protests in Iran at the U.S. State Department in Washington, U.S., October 14, 2022. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

When asked if Iran's reported slowdown and the release of the detainees to house arrest was in any way linked, Blinken said they were different issues. ""The agreement that we're pursuing to bring home those who are wrongfully detained in Iran is an entirely separate matter that we want to bring to a successful conclusion, and that's what I'm focused on.""

WRONGFULLY DETAINED

The deal announced last week has left out Shahab Dalili, 60, a U.S. permanent resident who has been detained in Iran since 2016, even though his family have repeatedly pleaded with the Biden administration to include him in the deal or at least label him ""wrongfully detained"".

Dalili has started a hunger strike in the Evin prison in Iran where he has been jailed, his son said on Monday.

The State Department makes the legal determination of wrongful detainment, which effectively means the U.S. government views the charges as politically motivated and false.

Blinken emphasized that the agreement included U.S. citizens who have all been designated as wrongfully detained and said Washington would continue to examine other cases.

""For reasons of privacy, I can't talk about any individual cases. I can simply say that as a matter of policy, we're constantly reviewing whether any particular individual, whether an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, who was incarcerated in another country is wrongfully detained,"" he said.

SHANGHAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group's (9988.HK) work communication and collaboration platform DingTalk will split from the company's cloud division, according to two sources close to the company.

The sources could not confirm the exact timing of the split and also did not confirm news reported by Chinese media outlet Caixin on Wednesday that DingTalk would pursue its own IPO in the near future.

DingTalk will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alibaba Holding Group and there would be no impact on its services, one source said.

Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Business Group did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the matter.

Though the Slack-like DingTalk will split structurally from Alibaba's Cloud Business Intelligence unit, the sources said it would continue to work closely with the cloud division technology-wise.

Alibaba's cloud division is itself working towards a public listing, having flagged it would be the first of the Group's newly created six business units to IPO.

The tech giant announced the split of its business in March and has said the cloud division was likely to IPO by May next year.

Alibaba Group last week reported better than expected results for its first quarter, but sales for its Cloud Intelligence Business Group, a major growth driver outside of e-commerce, reported the smallest revenue growth among the group's business units of 4%.

"Prayers, terror and a race to escape as wildfire bore down on Hawaiian town","[1/5] Yadira Ulloa, 55, sits outside her daughter's home in Lahaina after her home was destroyed during the Lahaina fire on the island of Maui in Hawaii, U.S., August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

OLOWALU, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Yadira Ulloa was pumping gas near the apartment building where she lived on the western side of Maui when the winds kicked up, blowing shingles off the roof and propelling the wildfire that would soon incinerate her town of Lahaina.

The winds from a distant hurricane were so fierce they shook her car, and as the fire approached, Ulloa began to pray. Her teen daughter, she realized, was alone in their apartment.

""God guided me,"" she said as she recalled the day last Tuesday when a wildfire ripped apart her community. ""I went straight to my apartment and there was my daughter.""

""Let's go!"" Ulloa told her. ""We ran away.""

Racing down the stairs, seeing the blaze come closer, Ulloa began to cry. ""The fire didn't stop,"" she said. ""It came running.""

They climbed into Ulloa's blue truck and fled. The gas station, she later learned, exploded when the wildfire reached it, and the apartment building burned to the ground.

The inferno killed at least 101 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Ulloa, who works as a housekeeper, and her daughter found refuge with an older daughter in the village of Olowalu. But the 55-year-old has been barely able to eat or sleep in the days since. Like many here, she wishes there had been an emergency alert warning to spur people into leaving sooner.

Taxi driver Kiet Ma, 56, was at home as the fire bore down, just 50 feet (15 m) away from his house. His wife Daisy Luu, 56 and also a taxi driver, was out on the road somewhere in the swirling black smoke. He couldn't reach her because phone and electrical services were down.

Finally, at around 4:30 pm, he said, ""I decided it's time to run."" He followed a neighbor out as the fire bore down. Emergency sirens came on, he said, but their announcements blared evacuations for a different part of town. For two nights, he slept in his car outside the fire zone before joining his wife at her sister's home in Olowalu - the same home where Ulloa's daughter rented a room.

On Thursday, Ma and Luu went back to check on their home - it was gone. Twenty years of work, driving private taxis on the island, putting everything into their house, and there was nothing left. Luu showed a visitor before-and-after photos - a peaceful looking ranch-style suburban home, bounded by a fence on a property dotted with palm trees. And then rubble.

""All my life put in, and it's gone in a minute,"" she said.

Yield gap between China and US widens to highest since 2007 after surprise rate cut,"A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Yield differentials between China and the U.S. widened to their highest in 16 years on Wednesday, as investors speculated that China's central bank would ease monetary policy further after a surprise rate cut, even if it puts the yuan under pressure.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly cut key policy rates for the second time in three months on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that the authorities are ramping up monetary easing efforts to boost a sputtering economic recovery. And markets widely expect the PBOC to loosen monetary policy further.

Earlier in the session, the PBOC also ramped up liquidity injection by offering the most short-term cash through seven-day reverse repos in open market operations since February.

China remains an outlier among global central banks as it has loosened monetary policy to shore up a stalling recovery whereas others, particularly the United States, have been in tightening cycles as they battle high inflation.

But the divergent monetary policy paths between the world's two largest economies widened the yield gap to 164 basis points between China's benchmark 10-year government bonds and U.S Treasuries s - the highest since February 2007.

""The significant yield gap, the largest since 2007, could be a key reason why capital remains planted in US dollars and US Treasuries for the time being,"" said David Chao, global market strategist at Asia Pacific at Invesco.

""More broadly, recent economic data releases in China have been disappointing, while those in the U.S. have surprised to the upside.""

The widening yield gap reduced foreign appetite in China's onshore yuan bonds, with latest official data showing overseas investors' holding declined in July.

Tumbling credit growth and rising deflation risks in July warranted more monetary easing measures to arrest the slowdown, market watchers said, while default risks at some major property developers and missed payments by a private wealth manager also hurt confidence in China's financial markets.

In derivatives market, one-year interest rate swaps , a gauge that measures investor expectations of future funding costs, fell to 1.84% this week, the lowest since September 2022, suggesting some market participants are pricing in further rate reductions.

But the expectations for further monetary easing and capital outflow risks has pressure on the Chinese yuan to depreciate further. The yuan has lost about 5.5% against the dollar since the start of the year, making it one of the worst performing Asian currencies.

""The PBOC will need to do more to manage the pace of yuan depreciation,"" Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB, said in a note.

US would welcome any Iranian steps to slow nuclear program,"WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday he could not confirm a report that Iran slowed its pace of amassing near-weapons-grade enriched uranium but would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

Blinken also told reporters that Iran moving U.S. detainees into house arrest was not related to any other aspect of U.S. policy toward Iran, which he said reflected a strategy of deterrence, pressure and diplomacy.

On Thursday, sources said Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from prison. A fifth was already under home confinement.

The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported Iran had significantly slowed the pace at which it was accumulating near-weapons-grade enriched uranium and diluted some of its stockpile, moves that could help ease tensions with the U.S. and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program.

""Of course, we would welcome any steps that Iran takes to actually deescalate the growing nuclear threat that it has posed since the United States got out of the Iran nuclear deal,"" Blinken told a news conference, alluding to former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 abandonment of that agreement.

Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and six major powers, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear program to make it harder for it to obtain an atomic weapon - an ambition it denies - in return for relief from U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Iranian-American writer Roya Hakakian, Iranian-American activist Sherry Hakimi and British-Iranian actress and activist Nazanin Boniadi to discuss the recent protests in Iran at the U.S. State Department in Washington, U.S., October 14, 2022. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

When asked if Iran's reported slowdown and the release of the detainees to house arrest was in any way linked, Blinken said they were different issues. ""The agreement that we're pursuing to bring home those who are wrongfully detained in Iran is an entirely separate matter that we want to bring to a successful conclusion, and that's what I'm focused on.""

WRONGFULLY DETAINED

The deal announced last week has left out Shahab Dalili, 60, a U.S. permanent resident who has been detained in Iran since 2016, even though his family have repeatedly pleaded with the Biden administration to include him in the deal or at least label him ""wrongfully detained"".

Dalili has started a hunger strike in the Evin prison in Iran where he has been jailed, his son said on Monday.

The State Department makes the legal determination of wrongful detainment, which effectively means the U.S. government views the charges as politically motivated and false.

Blinken emphasized that the agreement included U.S. citizens who have all been designated as wrongfully detained and said Washington would continue to examine other cases.

""For reasons of privacy, I can't talk about any individual cases. I can simply say that as a matter of policy, we're constantly reviewing whether any particular individual, whether an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, who was incarcerated in another country is wrongfully detained,"" he said.

Alibaba’s DingTalk to split from Cloud business group - sources,"The logo of DingTalk is seen, an offshoot of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China July 20, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song Acquire Licensing Rights

SHANGHAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group's (9988.HK) work communication and collaboration platform DingTalk will split from the company's cloud division, according to two sources close to the company.

The sources could not confirm the exact timing of the split and also did not confirm news reported by Chinese media outlet Caixin on Wednesday that DingTalk would pursue its own IPO in the near future.

DingTalk will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alibaba Holding Group and there would be no impact on its services, one source said.

Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Business Group did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the matter.

Though the Slack-like DingTalk will split structurally from Alibaba's Cloud Business Intelligence unit, the sources said it would continue to work closely with the cloud division technology-wise.

Alibaba's cloud division is itself working towards a public listing, having flagged it would be the first of the Group's newly created six business units to IPO.

The tech giant announced the split of its business in March and has said the cloud division was likely to IPO by May next year.

Alibaba Group last week reported better than expected results for its first quarter, but sales for its Cloud Intelligence Business Group, a major growth driver outside of e-commerce, reported the smallest revenue growth among the group's business units of 4%.

South African rand edges higher against dollar,"South African Rand coins are seen in this illustration picture taken October 30, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/Illustration Acquire Licensing Rights

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The South African rand edged higher on Wednesday, reversing some of the losses incurred the previous day after its biggest trading partner China cut key policy rates.

At 1538 GMT, the rand traded at 19.0750 against the dollar , over 0.3% stronger than its previous close.

The rand had weakened earlier this week on mounting worries over the health of China's economy.

The dollar last traded around 0.02% weaker against a basket of global currencies.

The rand was little moved by Statistics South Africa data showing the country's retail sales (ZARET=ECI) fell 0.9% year on the year in June after declining by a revised 1.6% in May. Analysts polled by Reuters expected a decline of 0.2% year on year.

""Consumers remain financially constrained dealing with elevated living costs, high interest rates and accordingly lower purchasing power,"" Investec analyst Lara Hodes said in a research note.

Retail sales have contracted in annual terms every month since December 2022, with rolling power blackouts a contributing factor.

Shares on the South African Stock Exchange fell, with the blue-chip Top-40 index (.JTOPI) ending 1% lower. South Africa's benchmark 2030 government bond was marginally stronger in early deals, with the yield down 1 basis point to 10.345%.

Philippines sees risk of conflict over Taiwan as a 'major concern',"Filipino soldiers stand at attention near a Philippine flag at Thitu island in disputed South China Sea April 21, 2017. REUTERS/Erik De Castro/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MANILA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Philippines seeks to bolster its ability to address threats while underlining the need to strengthen ties with allies while pursuing an independent foreign policy, under a six-year national security policy published on Tuesday.

The 48-page National Security Policy document, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr recently approved, highlighted ""sharpening strategic competition between the United States and China"" and ""heightened rivalries among the major powers"" as contributing to a ""more tense geopolitical landscape"".

""Major concern is also seen in the Cross-Straits relations that has the potential to be the flashpoint in the region,"" the government said in the document, published by the National Security Council, referring to the Taiwan Strait.

""The Philippines is concerned about its economic stability, a potential influx of refugees, and the welfare of overseas populations.""

Beijing, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own, has been staging military exercises in the waters off the island to press its claim of sovereignty. The United States and allies such as Japan criticise such pressure on Taiwan.

""Any military conflict in the Taiwan Strait would inevitably affect the Philippines given the geographic proximity of Taiwan to the Philippine archipelago and the presence of over 150,000 Filipinos in Taiwan,"" the government said in the document.

The Philippines' northernmost islands are 190 km (118 miles) away from Taiwan.

The plan also covered government food and energy security priorities and noted that the South China Sea ""remains a primary national interest"".

""The divergences of claims ... claimants' methods of asserting their positions, continue to pose strategic challenges"" that endanger territorial integrity and people's rights, said the Philippines, which is in dispute with China over parts of the sea.

To achieve energy security, the government said it would explore development of offshore reserves, including in the South China Sea, to help reduce dependence on imports.

Ties with China have grown tense under Marcos, as the Philippines pivots back to traditional ally the United States.

The Philippines would strengthen a Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S., along with other existing mechanisms with regional partners, to ""achieve a credible defence capability"", it said.

"'I love England,' migrant says as he lands after boat crossing","DUNGENESS, England, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Dozens of men, women and children arrived on a shingle beach on the southern coast of England on Wednesday, tired but relieved to be brought ashore by a large orange lifeboat after making the risky sea crossing from France in rubber dinghies.

They are the latest among more than 2,000 migrants who have reached Britain from countries like Iran, Syria and Afghanistan just this month, encouraged by better weather to make the journey in their bid to claim asylum in the UK.

""I love England,"" one bearded man told a Reuters photographer, smiling, as he walked on the gravely beach in a black parka jacket. He said he was from Syria.

Two other men at the beach also said they were Syrian, having reached Britain after passing through Italy and France, while a teenager said he was from Kuwait and it had taken him one month to arrive.

The numbers arriving underscore the scale of the challenge facing British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his pledge to ""stop the boats"" as he prepares for a national election expected next year.

At the beach in Dungeness, amid blue skies and warm weather, migrants disembarked government and charity lifeboats to be taken by bus to the ferry port of Dover an hour away for processing by British authorities.

In total, at least 100 migrants arrived on small boats on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally from Dungeness and Dover.

Those arriving included many children, some barefoot, clutching blankets and walking hand in hand with their parents, or being carried by officials in high-vis jackets.

Almost 17,000 migrants have arrived so far this year, although that is less than during the same period last year. In total, nearly 46,000 migrants were detected arriving in small boats in 2022. Many will have likely paid people smugglers for their crossings, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.

Sunak has faced criticism from some of his own lawmakers for not moving quickly enough to crack down on illegal migration, which has been blamed in parts of the country for stretching public services, including the provision of accommodation.

He has signed deals with France and Turkey to stem the flow of migrants, and his government passed an illegal migration law which plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, although that plan has been bogged down in the courts.

At the moment, however, the flow of migrants shows little sign of slowing as more boats arrive on the southern English coast.

Last year, August represented the highest number of small boat arrivals for any month on record, while half of all migrants arrived during August-October.

REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India on Wednesday approved plans for a nearly 580 billion rupee ($7 billion) scheme to deploy 10,000 electric buses in 169 cities over a decade, along with charging and associated infrastructure facilities.

The federal government will fund 200 billion rupees of the cost of the scheme, based on a public-private partnership model, Information Minister Anurag Thakur said at a briefing.

It was not immediately clear whether the remaining funds would come from state governments or private companies.

Shares of companies that investors expect to benefit from the plan rose after the news. Electric bus makers Olectra Greentech (OLEC.NS) and JBM Auto (JBMA.NS) closed up 8.8% and 10.1% respectively.

Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) was up 1.9%, while Ashok Leyland, which has a unit that makes electric buses, pared a 2.5% rise to settle 0.9% higher.

The government’s push for electric public transportation vehicles comes as it works to cut emissions and reduce fuel imports, with companies offered incentives to build vehicles and parts in the country.

Pursuing plans for a eventual fleet of 50,000 electric buses nationwide, at an estimated cost of $12 billion, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been aggregating demand from state governments and issuing contracts or tenders inviting companies to bid.

New Delhi's monetary support to green the country's public transport comes at a time when bus makers have raised concerns about state transport corporations that have previously delayed payment for conventional buses. Having a dedicated fund will provide security to bus makers, allowing them to bid freely for government contracts, say analysts.

The cabinet also approved seven railway tracking projects worth 325 billion rupees to boost connectivity and mobility across nine states.

"Prayers, terror and a race to escape as wildfire bore down on Hawaiian town","[1/5] Yadira Ulloa, 55, sits outside her daughter's home in Lahaina after her home was destroyed during the Lahaina fire on the island of Maui in Hawaii, U.S., August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

OLOWALU, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Yadira Ulloa was pumping gas near the apartment building where she lived on the western side of Maui when the winds kicked up, blowing shingles off the roof and propelling the wildfire that would soon incinerate her town of Lahaina.

The winds from a distant hurricane were so fierce they shook her car, and as the fire approached, Ulloa began to pray. Her teen daughter, she realized, was alone in their apartment.

""God guided me,"" she said as she recalled the day last Tuesday when a wildfire ripped apart her community. ""I went straight to my apartment and there was my daughter.""

""Let's go!"" Ulloa told her. ""We ran away.""

Racing down the stairs, seeing the blaze come closer, Ulloa began to cry. ""The fire didn't stop,"" she said. ""It came running.""

They climbed into Ulloa's blue truck and fled. The gas station, she later learned, exploded when the wildfire reached it, and the apartment building burned to the ground.

The inferno killed at least 101 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Ulloa, who works as a housekeeper, and her daughter found refuge with an older daughter in the village of Olowalu. But the 55-year-old has been barely able to eat or sleep in the days since. Like many here, she wishes there had been an emergency alert warning to spur people into leaving sooner.

Taxi driver Kiet Ma, 56, was at home as the fire bore down, just 50 feet (15 m) away from his house. His wife Daisy Luu, 56 and also a taxi driver, was out on the road somewhere in the swirling black smoke. He couldn't reach her because phone and electrical services were down.

Finally, at around 4:30 pm, he said, ""I decided it's time to run."" He followed a neighbor out as the fire bore down. Emergency sirens came on, he said, but their announcements blared evacuations for a different part of town. For two nights, he slept in his car outside the fire zone before joining his wife at her sister's home in Olowalu - the same home where Ulloa's daughter rented a room.

On Thursday, Ma and Luu went back to check on their home - it was gone. Twenty years of work, driving private taxis on the island, putting everything into their house, and there was nothing left. Luu showed a visitor before-and-after photos - a peaceful looking ranch-style suburban home, bounded by a fence on a property dotted with palm trees. And then rubble.

""All my life put in, and it's gone in a minute,"" she said.

Yield gap between China and US widens to highest since 2007 after surprise rate cut,"A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Yield differentials between China and the U.S. widened to their highest in 16 years on Wednesday, as investors speculated that China's central bank would ease monetary policy further after a surprise rate cut, even if it puts the yuan under pressure.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly cut key policy rates for the second time in three months on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that the authorities are ramping up monetary easing efforts to boost a sputtering economic recovery. And markets widely expect the PBOC to loosen monetary policy further.

Earlier in the session, the PBOC also ramped up liquidity injection by offering the most short-term cash through seven-day reverse repos in open market operations since February.

China remains an outlier among global central banks as it has loosened monetary policy to shore up a stalling recovery whereas others, particularly the United States, have been in tightening cycles as they battle high inflation.

But the divergent monetary policy paths between the world's two largest economies widened the yield gap to 164 basis points between China's benchmark 10-year government bonds and U.S Treasuries s - the highest since February 2007.

""The significant yield gap, the largest since 2007, could be a key reason why capital remains planted in US dollars and US Treasuries for the time being,"" said David Chao, global market strategist at Asia Pacific at Invesco.

""More broadly, recent economic data releases in China have been disappointing, while those in the U.S. have surprised to the upside.""

The widening yield gap reduced foreign appetite in China's onshore yuan bonds, with latest official data showing overseas investors' holding declined in July.

Tumbling credit growth and rising deflation risks in July warranted more monetary easing measures to arrest the slowdown, market watchers said, while default risks at some major property developers and missed payments by a private wealth manager also hurt confidence in China's financial markets.

In derivatives market, one-year interest rate swaps , a gauge that measures investor expectations of future funding costs, fell to 1.84% this week, the lowest since September 2022, suggesting some market participants are pricing in further rate reductions.

But the expectations for further monetary easing and capital outflow risks has pressure on the Chinese yuan to depreciate further. The yuan has lost about 5.5% against the dollar since the start of the year, making it one of the worst performing Asian currencies.

""The PBOC will need to do more to manage the pace of yuan depreciation,"" Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB, said in a note.

US would welcome any Iranian steps to slow nuclear program,"WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday he could not confirm a report that Iran slowed its pace of amassing near-weapons-grade enriched uranium but would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

Blinken also told reporters that Iran moving U.S. detainees into house arrest was not related to any other aspect of U.S. policy toward Iran, which he said reflected a strategy of deterrence, pressure and diplomacy.

On Thursday, sources said Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from prison. A fifth was already under home confinement.

The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported Iran had significantly slowed the pace at which it was accumulating near-weapons-grade enriched uranium and diluted some of its stockpile, moves that could help ease tensions with the U.S. and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program.

""Of course, we would welcome any steps that Iran takes to actually deescalate the growing nuclear threat that it has posed since the United States got out of the Iran nuclear deal,"" Blinken told a news conference, alluding to former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 abandonment of that agreement.

Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and six major powers, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear program to make it harder for it to obtain an atomic weapon - an ambition it denies - in return for relief from U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Iranian-American writer Roya Hakakian, Iranian-American activist Sherry Hakimi and British-Iranian actress and activist Nazanin Boniadi to discuss the recent protests in Iran at the U.S. State Department in Washington, U.S., October 14, 2022.

When asked if Iran's reported slowdown and the release of the detainees to house arrest was in any way linked, Blinken said they were different issues. ""The agreement that we're pursuing to bring home those who are wrongfully detained in Iran is an entirely separate matter that we want to bring to a successful conclusion, and that's what I'm focused on.""

WRONGFULLY DETAINED

The deal announced last week has left out Shahab Dalili, 60, a U.S. permanent resident who has been detained in Iran since 2016, even though his family have repeatedly pleaded with the Biden administration to include him in the deal or at least label him ""wrongfully detained"".

Dalili has started a hunger strike in the Evin prison in Iran where he has been jailed, his son said on Monday.

The State Department makes the legal determination of wrongful detainment, which effectively means the U.S. government views the charges as politically motivated and false.

Blinken emphasized that the agreement included U.S. citizens who have all been designated as wrongfully detained and said Washington would continue to examine other cases.

""For reasons of privacy, I can't talk about any individual cases. I can simply say that as a matter of policy, we're constantly reviewing whether any particular individual, whether an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, who was incarcerated in another country is wrongfully detained,"" he said.

The tech giant announced the split of its business in March and has said the cloud division was likely to IPO by May next year.

Alibaba Group last week reported better than expected results for its first quarter, but sales for its Cloud Intelligence Business Group, a major growth driver outside of e-commerce, reported the smallest revenue growth among the group's business units of 4%.

BENGALURU, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Investment firm GQG Partners bought an 8.1% stake in India's Adani Power (ADAN.NS) for $1.1 billion via block deals on Wednesday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Multiple GQG funds bought around 152.1 million shares, as per data from BSE, one of India's top stock exchanges, from Worldwide Emerging Market Holding and Afro ASIA Trade And Investments.

Adani Power and GQG did not immediately respond to Reuters' request seeking comments.

The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based GQG has made several other investments in the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate's companies previously.

The investment comes days after Deloitte quit as auditor for one of the conglomerate's key business units, renewing investor concerns even as the group slowly recovers from a report by U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research, released in January.

The report, which alleged improper use of tax havens and concerns over the conglomerate's debt levels - something it denies - wiped out nearly $147 billion from the market cap of the group's listed entities.

Though shares of the group companies have rebounded, they are still down around $100 billion in value.

Adani Ports had said that Deloitte's reason for quitting as its auditor was ""not convincing or sufficient to warrant such a move.

Meanwhile, India's market regulator has sought 15 more days to complete a probe into the Adani Group's dealings with certain offshore entities.

"'I love England,' migrant says as he lands after boat crossing","DUNGENESS, England, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Dozens of men, women and children arrived on a shingle beach on the southern coast of England on Wednesday, tired but relieved to be brought ashore by a large orange lifeboat after making the risky sea crossing from France in rubber dinghies.

They are the latest among more than 2,000 migrants who have reached Britain from countries like Iran, Syria and Afghanistan just this month, encouraged by better weather to make the journey in their bid to claim asylum in the UK.

""I love England,"" one bearded man told a Reuters photographer, smiling, as he walked on the gravely beach in a black parka jacket. He said he was from Syria.

Two other men at the beach also said they were Syrian, having reached Britain after passing through Italy and France, while a teenager said he was from Kuwait and it had taken him one month to arrive.

The numbers arriving underscore the scale of the challenge facing British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his pledge to ""stop the boats"" as he prepares for a national election expected next year.

At the beach in Dungeness, amid blue skies and warm weather, migrants disembarked government and charity lifeboats to be taken by bus to the ferry port of Dover an hour away for processing by British authorities.

In total, at least 100 migrants arrived on small boats on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally from Dungeness and Dover.

Those arriving included many children, some barefoot, clutching blankets and walking hand in hand with their parents, or being carried by officials in high-vis jackets.

Almost 17,000 migrants have arrived so far this year, although that is less than during the same period last year. In total, nearly 46,000 migrants were detected arriving in small boats in 2022. Many will have likely paid people smugglers for their crossings, often in overcrowded, unseaworthy boats.

Sunak has faced criticism from some of his own lawmakers for not moving quickly enough to crack down on illegal migration, which has been blamed in parts of the country for stretching public services, including the provision of accommodation.

He has signed deals with France and Turkey to stem the flow of migrants, and his government passed an illegal migration law which plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, although that plan has been bogged down in the courts.

At the moment, however, the flow of migrants shows little sign of slowing as more boats arrive on the southern English coast.

Last year, August represented the highest number of small boat arrivals for any month on record, while half of all migrants arrived during August-October.

India approves $7 bln plan for electric buses in nearly 170 cities,"Traffic moves in front of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) building and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) as they are lit up in the colours of India's national flag ahead of the 75th Independence Day celebrations, in Mumbai, India, August 13, 2022. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - India on Wednesday approved plans for a nearly 580 billion rupee ($7 billion) scheme to deploy 10,000 electric buses in 169 cities over a decade, along with charging and associated infrastructure facilities.

The federal government will fund 200 billion rupees of the cost of the scheme, based on a public-private partnership model, Information Minister Anurag Thakur said at a briefing.

It was not immediately clear whether the remaining funds would come from state governments or private companies.

Shares of companies that investors expect to benefit from the plan rose after the news. Electric bus makers Olectra Greentech (OLEC.NS) and JBM Auto (JBMA.NS) closed up 8.8% and 10.1% respectively.

Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) was up 1.9%, while Ashok Leyland, which has a unit that makes electric buses, pared a 2.5% rise to settle 0.9% higher.

The government’s push for electric public transportation vehicles comes as it works to cut emissions and reduce fuel imports, with companies offered incentives to build vehicles and parts in the country.

Pursuing plans for a eventual fleet of 50,000 electric buses nationwide, at an estimated cost of $12 billion, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been aggregating demand from state governments and issuing contracts or tenders inviting companies to bid.

New Delhi's monetary support to green the country's public transport comes at a time when bus makers have raised concerns about state transport corporations that have previously delayed payment for conventional buses. Having a dedicated fund will provide security to bus makers, allowing them to bid freely for government contracts, say analysts.

The cabinet also approved seven railway tracking projects worth 325 billion rupees to boost connectivity and mobility across nine states.

"Prayers, terror and a race to escape as wildfire bore down on Hawaiian town","[1/5] Yadira Ulloa, 55, sits outside her daughter's home in Lahaina after her home was destroyed during the Lahaina fire on the island of Maui in Hawaii, U.S., August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

OLOWALU, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Yadira Ulloa was pumping gas near the apartment building where she lived on the western side of Maui when the winds kicked up, blowing shingles off the roof and propelling the wildfire that would soon incinerate her town of Lahaina.

The winds from a distant hurricane were so fierce they shook her car, and as the fire approached, Ulloa began to pray. Her teen daughter, she realized, was alone in their apartment.

""God guided me,"" she said as she recalled the day last Tuesday when a wildfire ripped apart her community. ""I went straight to my apartment and there was my daughter.""

""Let's go!"" Ulloa told her. ""We ran away.""

Racing down the stairs, seeing the blaze come closer, Ulloa began to cry. ""The fire didn't stop,"" she said. ""It came running.""

They climbed into Ulloa's blue truck and fled. The gas station, she later learned, exploded when the wildfire reached it, and the apartment building burned to the ground.

The inferno killed at least 101 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Ulloa, who works as a housekeeper, and her daughter found refuge with an older daughter in the village of Olowalu. But the 55-year-old has been barely able to eat or sleep in the days since. Like many here, she wishes there had been an emergency alert warning to spur people into leaving sooner.

Taxi driver Kiet Ma, 56, was at home as the fire bore down, just 50 feet (15 m) away from his house. His wife Daisy Luu, 56 and also a taxi driver, was out on the road somewhere in the swirling black smoke. He couldn't reach her because phone and electrical services were down.

Finally, at around 4:30 pm, he said, ""I decided it's time to run."" He followed a neighbor out as the fire bore down. Emergency sirens came on, he said, but their announcements blared evacuations for a different part of town. For two nights, he slept in his car outside the fire zone before joining his wife at her sister's home in Olowalu - the same home where Ulloa's daughter rented a room.

On Thursday, Ma and Luu went back to check on their home - it was gone. Twenty years of work, driving private taxis on the island, putting everything into their house, and there was nothing left. Luu showed a visitor before-and-after photos - a peaceful looking ranch-style suburban home, bounded by a fence on a property dotted with palm trees. And then rubble.

""All my life put in, and it's gone in a minute,"" she said.

Yield gap between China and US widens to highest since 2007 after surprise rate cut,"A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Yield differentials between China and the U.S. widened to their highest in 16 years on Wednesday, as investors speculated that China's central bank would ease monetary policy further after a surprise rate cut, even if it puts the yuan under pressure.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly cut key policy rates for the second time in three months on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that the authorities are ramping up monetary easing efforts to boost a sputtering economic recovery. And markets widely expect the PBOC to loosen monetary policy further.

Earlier in the session, the PBOC also ramped up liquidity injection by offering the most short-term cash through seven-day reverse repos in open market operations since February.

China remains an outlier among global central banks as it has loosened monetary policy to shore up a stalling recovery whereas others, particularly the United States, have been in tightening cycles as they battle high inflation.

But the divergent monetary policy paths between the world's two largest economies widened the yield gap to 164 basis points between China's benchmark 10-year government bonds and U.S Treasuries s - the highest since February 2007.

Reuters Graphics

""The significant yield gap, the largest since 2007, could be a key reason why capital remains planted in US dollars and US Treasuries for the time being,"" said David Chao, global market strategist at Asia Pacific at Invesco.

""More broadly, recent economic data releases in China have been disappointing, while those in the U.S. have surprised to the upside.""

The widening yield gap reduced foreign appetite in China's onshore yuan bonds, with latest official data showing overseas investors' holding declined in July.

Tumbling credit growth and rising deflation risks in July warranted more monetary easing measures to arrest the slowdown, market watchers said, while default risks at some major property developers and missed payments by a private wealth manager also hurt confidence in China's financial markets.

In derivatives market, one-year interest rate swaps , a gauge that measures investor expectations of future funding costs, fell to 1.84% this week, the lowest since September 2022, suggesting some market participants are pricing in further rate reductions.

But the expectations for further monetary easing and capital outflow risks has pressure on the Chinese yuan to depreciate further. The yuan has lost about 5.5% against the dollar since the start of the year, making it one of the worst performing Asian currencies.

""The PBOC will need to do more to manage the pace of yuan depreciation,"" Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB, said in a note.

US would welcome any Iranian steps to slow nuclear program,"WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday he could not confirm a report that Iran slowed its pace of amassing near-weapons-grade enriched uranium but would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

Blinken also told reporters that Iran moving U.S. detainees into house arrest was not related to any other aspect of U.S. policy toward Iran, which he said reflected a strategy of deterrence, pressure and diplomacy.

On Thursday, sources said Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from prison. A fifth was already under home confinement.

The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported Iran had significantly slowed the pace at which it was accumulating near-weapons-grade enriched uranium and diluted some of its stockpile, moves that could help ease tensions with the U.S. and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program.

""Of course, we would welcome any steps that Iran takes to actually deescalate the growing nuclear threat that it has posed since the United States got out of the Iran nuclear deal,"" Blinken told a news conference, alluding to former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 abandonment of that agreement.

Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and six major powers, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear program to make it harder for it to obtain an atomic weapon - an ambition it denies - in return for relief from U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Iranian-American writer Roya Hakakian, Iranian-American activist Sherry Hakimi and British-Iranian actress and activist Nazanin Boniadi to discuss the recent protests in Iran at the U.S. State Department in Washington, U.S., October 14, 2022. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

When asked if Iran's reported slowdown and the release of the detainees to house arrest was in any way linked, Blinken said they were different issues. ""The agreement that we're pursuing to bring home those who are wrongfully detained in Iran is an entirely separate matter that we want to bring to a successful conclusion, and that's what I'm focused on.""

WRONGFULLY DETAINED

The deal announced last week has left out Shahab Dalili, 60, a U.S. permanent resident who has been detained in Iran since 2016, even though his family have repeatedly pleaded with the Biden administration to include him in the deal or at least label him ""wrongfully detained"".

Dalili has started a hunger strike in the Evin prison in Iran where he has been jailed, his son said on Monday.

The State Department makes the legal determination of wrongful detainment, which effectively means the U.S. government views the charges as politically motivated and false.

Blinken emphasized that the agreement included U.S. citizens who have all been designated as wrongfully detained and said Washington would continue to examine other cases.

""For reasons of privacy, I can't talk about any individual cases. I can simply say that as a matter of policy, we're constantly reviewing whether any particular individual, whether an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, who was incarcerated in another country is wrongfully detained,"" he said.

SHANGHAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group's (9988.HK) work communication and collaboration platform DingTalk will split from the company's cloud division, according to two sources close to the company.

The sources could not confirm the exact timing of the split and also did not confirm news reported by Chinese media outlet Caixin on Wednesday that DingTalk would pursue its own IPO in the near future.

DingTalk will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alibaba Holding Group and there would be no impact on its services, one source said.

Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Business Group did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the matter.

Though the Slack-like DingTalk will split structurally from Alibaba's Cloud Business Intelligence unit, the sources said it would continue to work closely with the cloud division technology-wise.

Alibaba's cloud division is itself working towards a public listing, having flagged it would be the first of the Group's newly created six business units to IPO.

The tech giant announced the split of its business in March and has said the cloud division was likely to IPO by May next year.

Alibaba Group last week reported better than expected results for its first quarter, but sales for its Cloud Intelligence Business Group, a major growth driver outside of e-commerce, reported the smallest revenue growth among the group's business units of 4%.

South African rand edges higher against dollar,"South African Rand coins are seen in this illustration picture taken October 30, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/Illustration Acquire Licensing Rights

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The South African rand edged higher on Wednesday, reversing some of the losses incurred the previous day after its biggest trading partner China cut key policy rates.

At 1538 GMT, the rand traded at 19.0750 against the dollar , over 0.3% stronger than its previous close.

The rand had weakened earlier this week on mounting worries over the health of China's economy.

The dollar last traded around 0.02% weaker against a basket of global currencies.

The rand was little moved by Statistics South Africa data showing the country's retail sales (ZARET=ECI) fell 0.9% year on the year in June after declining by a revised 1.6% in May. Analysts polled by Reuters expected a decline of 0.2% year on year.

""Consumers remain financially constrained dealing with elevated living costs, high interest rates and accordingly lower purchasing power,"" Investec analyst Lara Hodes said in a research note.

Retail sales have contracted in annual terms every month since December 2022, with rolling power blackouts a contributing factor.

Shares on the South African Stock Exchange fell, with the blue-chip Top-40 index (.JTOPI) ending 1% lower. South Africa's benchmark 2030 government bond was marginally stronger in early deals, with the yield down 1 basis point to 10.345%.

"Iraq set in 'battle' against dollar smugglers, c.bank governor says","Summary Iraq trying to crack down on dollar smuggling, including to Iran

Baghdad faces hard task of balancing Washington, Tehran

Banking sector could shrink with new regulations

Govt, c.bank eye modernizing, digitizing economy

BAGHDAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Iraq has made strides implementing U.S. dollar supply restrictions targeting Iran but faces an uphill battle with a banking system unaccustomed to strict oversight and persistent currency smugglers, central bank governor Ali al-Allaq said.

""It is really a battle, because the people benefiting from this situation and those harmed (by the new measures) will try in various ways to continue their illegal activities,"" Allaq said in an interview with Reuters.

Allaq did not mention Iran by name and said he did not have data on how much of Iraq's dollars been smuggled to Iran or other neighbouring countries, including Turkey and Syria, before the United States tightened regulations in November.

The U.S. measures that aim to enforce sanctions on Iran are a sensitive matter in a country that has often been a front line in the rivalry between Washington and Tehran.

Iraq's government is reliant on Washington's continued goodwill to ensure oil revenues and finances do not face U.S. censure, but it came to power with the support of powerful, Tehran-backed groups and so cannot afford to alienate Iran.

The latter groups have accused the U.S. of meddling in Iraq's internal affairs and creating a currency crisis, as businesses either struggling or unwilling to abide by the new measures sourced dollars from exchange shops, driving down the value of the Iraqi dinar.

Iraq has more than $100 billion dollars in reserves, Allaq said, but could not freely intervene in the market to bring the rate down due to the restrictions.

Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Fed barred 14 Iraqi banks from conducting dollar transactions as part of a wider crackdown on dollar smuggling to Iran via the Iraqi banking system, U.S. officials said.

Allaq said that action related to transfers from 2022, before a new platform that aimed to improve transparency went live. He said the central bank was undertaking a review of the banking sector and introducing new regulations that he said would likely see some banks close.

""It would be very normal in the coming period to see a reduction in the (number of private banks),"" he said.

""There are always side-effects, but at the same time we have a responsibility to protect the country's interests by trying to find the necessary means for monitoring and oversight so as not to expose the country to any issues on this front,"" he said.

'TRANSFORMATION'

The U.S. measures have targeted Iraq's so-called dollar auction, where the central bank requests dollars from the U.S. Federal Reserve before selling them to commercial banks, which in turn sell the funds to businesses in the highly import-dependent economy.

U.S. and Iraqi officials have said the auction allowed large sums of money to be illegitimately acquired by groups who would provide fake invoices and then either transfer or physically smuggle the funds to neighbouring countries, chiefly Iran.

A feature of a highly informal economy, the system was also used by thousands of small businesses that are not registered with the state, Allaq said, a widespread phenomenon in Iraq that allows them to dodge taxes and customs fees.

Since January the central bank has asked banks to provide detailed information on senders and recipients of transfers via an online platform.

When companies began trying to use the platform in January, less than 20% of requests were approved by U.S authorities, Allaq said. That number had now risen to around 85 percent, signalling growing ease with the new regulations, he said.

Allaq said that tighter regulations along with government plans to promote digital payment were forcing a wider shift in the Iraq economy in a country where cash remains king and the majority of adults do not have bank accounts.

""It is not just an electronic platform, it will lead to a total reorganisation of trade and the movement of money, and control on a lot of avenues for suspicious activity.""

In derivatives market, one-year interest rate swaps , a gauge that measures investor expectations of future funding costs, fell to 1.84% this week, the lowest since September 2022, suggesting some market participants are pricing in further rate reductions.

But the expectations for further monetary easing and capital outflow risks has pressure on the Chinese yuan to depreciate further. The yuan has lost about 5.5% against the dollar since the start of the year, making it one of the worst performing Asian currencies.

""The PBOC will need to do more to manage the pace of yuan depreciation,"" Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB, said in a note.

US would welcome any Iranian steps to slow nuclear program,"WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday he could not confirm a report that Iran slowed its pace of amassing near-weapons-grade enriched uranium but would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

Blinken also told reporters that Iran moving U.S. detainees into house arrest was not related to any other aspect of U.S. policy toward Iran, which he said reflected a strategy of deterrence, pressure and diplomacy.

On Thursday, sources said Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from prison. A fifth was already under home confinement.

The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported Iran had significantly slowed the pace at which it was accumulating near-weapons-grade enriched uranium and diluted some of its stockpile, moves that could help ease tensions with the U.S. and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program.

""Of course, we would welcome any steps that Iran takes to actually deescalate the growing nuclear threat that it has posed since the United States got out of the Iran nuclear deal,"" Blinken told a news conference, alluding to former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 abandonment of that agreement.

Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and six major powers, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear program to make it harder for it to obtain an atomic weapon - an ambition it denies - in return for relief from U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Iranian-American writer Roya Hakakian, Iranian-American activist Sherry Hakimi and British-Iranian actress and activist Nazanin Boniadi to discuss the recent protests in Iran at the U.S. State Department in Washington, U.S., October 14, 2022. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

When asked if Iran's reported slowdown and the release of the detainees to house arrest was in any way linked, Blinken said they were different issues. ""The agreement that we're pursuing to bring home those who are wrongfully detained in Iran is an entirely separate matter that we want to bring to a successful conclusion, and that's what I'm focused on.""

WRONGFULLY DETAINED

The deal announced last week has left out Shahab Dalili, 60, a U.S. permanent resident who has been detained in Iran since 2016, even though his family have repeatedly pleaded with the Biden administration to include him in the deal or at least label him ""wrongfully detained"".

Dalili has started a hunger strike in the Evin prison in Iran where he has been jailed, his son said on Monday.

The State Department makes the legal determination of wrongful detainment, which effectively means the U.S. government views the charges as politically motivated and false.

Blinken emphasized that the agreement included U.S. citizens who have all been designated as wrongfully detained and said Washington would continue to examine other cases.

""For reasons of privacy, I can't talk about any individual cases. I can simply say that as a matter of policy, we're constantly reviewing whether any particular individual, whether an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, who was incarcerated in another country is wrongfully detained,"" he said.

Alibaba’s DingTalk to split from Cloud business group - sources,"The logo of DingTalk is seen, an offshoot of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China July 20, 2018. REUTERS/Aly Song Acquire Licensing Rights

SHANGHAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group's (9988.HK) work communication and collaboration platform DingTalk will split from the company's cloud division, according to two sources close to the company.

The sources could not confirm the exact timing of the split and also did not confirm news reported by Chinese media outlet Caixin on Wednesday that DingTalk would pursue its own IPO in the near future.

DingTalk will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alibaba Holding Group and there would be no impact on its services, one source said.

Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Business Group did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the matter.

Though the Slack-like DingTalk will split structurally from Alibaba's Cloud Business Intelligence unit, the sources said it would continue to work closely with the cloud division technology-wise.

Alibaba's cloud division is itself working towards a public listing, having flagged it would be the first of the Group's newly created six business units to IPO.

The tech giant announced the split of its business in March and has said the cloud division was likely to IPO by May next year.

Alibaba Group last week reported better than expected results for its first quarter, but sales for its Cloud Intelligence Business Group, a major growth driver outside of e-commerce, reported the smallest revenue growth among the group's business units of 4%.

South African rand edges higher against dollar,"South African Rand coins are seen in this illustration picture taken October 30, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/Illustration Acquire Licensing Rights

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The South African rand edged higher on Wednesday, reversing some of the losses incurred the previous day after its biggest trading partner China cut key policy rates.

At 1538 GMT, the rand traded at 19.0750 against the dollar , over 0.3% stronger than its previous close.

The rand had weakened earlier this week on mounting worries over the health of China's economy.

The dollar last traded around 0.02% weaker against a basket of global currencies.

The rand was little moved by Statistics South Africa data showing the country's retail sales (ZARET=ECI) fell 0.9% year on the year in June after declining by a revised 1.6% in May. Analysts polled by Reuters expected a decline of 0.2% year on year.

""Consumers remain financially constrained dealing with elevated living costs, high interest rates and accordingly lower purchasing power,"" Investec analyst Lara Hodes said in a research note.

Retail sales have contracted in annual terms every month since December 2022, with rolling power blackouts a contributing factor.

Shares on the South African Stock Exchange fell, with the blue-chip Top-40 index (.JTOPI) ending 1% lower. South Africa's benchmark 2030 government bond was marginally stronger in early deals, with the yield down 1 basis point to 10.345%.

BENGALURU, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Investment firm GQG Partners bought an 8.1% stake in India's Adani Power (ADAN.NS) for $1.1 billion via block deals on Wednesday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Multiple GQG funds bought around 152.1 million shares, as per data from BSE, one of India's top stock exchanges, from Worldwide Emerging Market Holding and Afro ASIA Trade And Investments.

Adani Power and GQG did not immediately respond to Reuters' request seeking comments.

The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based GQG has made several other investments in the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate's companies previously.

The investment comes days after Deloitte quit as auditor for one of the conglomerate's key business units, renewing investor concerns even as the group slowly recovers from a report by U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research, released in January.

The report, which alleged improper use of tax havens and concerns over the conglomerate's debt levels - something it denies - wiped out nearly $147 billion from the market cap of the group's listed entities.

Though shares of the group companies have rebounded, they are still down around $100 billion in value.

Adani Ports had said that Deloitte's reason for quitting as its auditor was ""not convincing or sufficient to warrant such a move.

Meanwhile, India's market regulator has sought 15 more days to complete a probe into the Adani Group's dealings with certain offshore entities.

"Iraq set in 'battle' against dollar smugglers, c.bank governor says","Summary Iraq trying to crack down on dollar smuggling, including to Iran

Baghdad faces hard task of balancing Washington, Tehran

Banking sector could shrink with new regulations

Govt, c.bank eye modernizing, digitizing economy

BAGHDAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Iraq has made strides implementing U.S. dollar supply restrictions targeting Iran but faces an uphill battle with a banking system unaccustomed to strict oversight and persistent currency smugglers, central bank governor Ali al-Allaq said.

""It is really a battle, because the people benefiting from this situation and those harmed (by the new measures) will try in various ways to continue their illegal activities,"" Allaq said in an interview with Reuters.

Allaq did not mention Iran by name and said he did not have data on how much of Iraq's dollars been smuggled to Iran or other neighbouring countries, including Turkey and Syria, before the United States tightened regulations in November.

The U.S. measures that aim to enforce sanctions on Iran are a sensitive matter in a country that has often been a front line in the rivalry between Washington and Tehran.

Iraq's government is reliant on Washington's continued goodwill to ensure oil revenues and finances do not face U.S. censure, but it came to power with the support of powerful, Tehran-backed groups and so cannot afford to alienate Iran.

The latter groups have accused the U.S. of meddling in Iraq's internal affairs and creating a currency crisis, as businesses either struggling or unwilling to abide by the new measures sourced dollars from exchange shops, driving down the value of the Iraqi dinar.

Iraq has more than $100 billion dollars in reserves, Allaq said, but could not freely intervene in the market to bring the rate down due to the restrictions.

Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Fed barred 14 Iraqi banks from conducting dollar transactions as part of a wider crackdown on dollar smuggling to Iran via the Iraqi banking system, U.S. officials said.

Allaq said that action related to transfers from 2022, before a new platform that aimed to improve transparency went live. He said the central bank was undertaking a review of the banking sector and introducing new regulations that he said would likely see some banks close.

""It would be very normal in the coming period to see a reduction in the (number of private banks),"" he said.

""There are always side-effects, but at the same time we have a responsibility to protect the country's interests by trying to find the necessary means for monitoring and oversight so as not to expose the country to any issues on this front,"" he said.

'TRANSFORMATION'

The U.S. measures have targeted Iraq's so-called dollar auction, where the central bank requests dollars from the U.S. Federal Reserve before selling them to commercial banks, which in turn sell the funds to businesses in the highly import-dependent economy.

U.S. and Iraqi officials have said the auction allowed large sums of money to be illegitimately acquired by groups who would provide fake invoices and then either transfer or physically smuggle the funds to neighbouring countries, chiefly Iran.

A feature of a highly informal economy, the system was also used by thousands of small businesses that are not registered with the state, Allaq said, a widespread phenomenon in Iraq that allows them to dodge taxes and customs fees.

Since January the central bank has asked banks to provide detailed information on senders and recipients of transfers via an online platform.

When companies began trying to use the platform in January, less than 20% of requests were approved by U.S authorities, Allaq said. That number had now risen to around 85 percent, signalling growing ease with the new regulations, he said.

Allaq said that tighter regulations along with government plans to promote digital payment were forcing a wider shift in the Iraq economy in a country where cash remains king and the majority of adults do not have bank accounts.

""It is not just an electronic platform, it will lead to a total reorganisation of trade and the movement of money, and control on a lot of avenues for suspicious activity.""

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator will continue to carefully review issuer filings, it said on Wednesday in response to a Reuters report that Chinese offshore issuers are toning down China-related business risks in their listing documents.

""Any issuer who chooses to access the U.S. capital markets must comply with our federal securities laws and regulations,"" a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday.

""Our staff will continue its long-standing practice of carefully reviewing issuer filings and commenting to the issuer when appropriate.""

China's securities regulator last month asked domestic law firms to refrain from including negative descriptions of China's policies or its business and legal environment in initial public offering prospectuses, Reuters previously reported. China law firms are now scrambling to comply with that guidance.

In response to the Reuters Tuesday report, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, urged SEC chair Gary Gensler to ""take action to protect American retirees and investors from these deceptive Chinese firms.""

"Prayers, terror and a race to escape as wildfire bore down on Hawaiian town","[1/5] Yadira Ulloa, 55, sits outside her daughter's home in Lahaina after her home was destroyed during the Lahaina fire on the island of Maui in Hawaii, U.S., August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo Acquire Licensing Rights

OLOWALU, Hawaii, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Yadira Ulloa was pumping gas near the apartment building where she lived on the western side of Maui when the winds kicked up, blowing shingles off the roof and propelling the wildfire that would soon incinerate her town of Lahaina.

The winds from a distant hurricane were so fierce they shook her car, and as the fire approached, Ulloa began to pray. Her teen daughter, she realized, was alone in their apartment.

""God guided me,"" she said as she recalled the day last Tuesday when a wildfire ripped apart her community. ""I went straight to my apartment and there was my daughter.""

""Let's go!"" Ulloa told her. ""We ran away.""

Racing down the stairs, seeing the blaze come closer, Ulloa began to cry. ""The fire didn't stop,"" she said. ""It came running.""

They climbed into Ulloa's blue truck and fled. The gas station, she later learned, exploded when the wildfire reached it, and the apartment building burned to the ground.

The inferno killed at least 101 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina.

The magnitude of the fire, which charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours, combined with the logistical challenges of recovery have taken a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

Ulloa, who works as a housekeeper, and her daughter found refuge with an older daughter in the village of Olowalu. But the 55-year-old has been barely able to eat or sleep in the days since. Like many here, she wishes there had been an emergency alert warning to spur people into leaving sooner.

Taxi driver Kiet Ma, 56, was at home as the fire bore down, just 50 feet (15 m) away from his house. His wife Daisy Luu, 56 and also a taxi driver, was out on the road somewhere in the swirling black smoke. He couldn't reach her because phone and electrical services were down.

Finally, at around 4:30 pm, he said, ""I decided it's time to run."" He followed a neighbor out as the fire bore down. Emergency sirens came on, he said, but their announcements blared evacuations for a different part of town. For two nights, he slept in his car outside the fire zone before joining his wife at her sister's home in Olowalu - the same home where Ulloa's daughter rented a room.

On Thursday, Ma and Luu went back to check on their home - it was gone. Twenty years of work, driving private taxis on the island, putting everything into their house, and there was nothing left. Luu showed a visitor before-and-after photos - a peaceful looking ranch-style suburban home, bounded by a fence on a property dotted with palm trees. And then rubble.

""All my life put in, and it's gone in a minute,"" she said.

Yield gap between China and US widens to highest since 2007 after surprise rate cut,"A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Yield differentials between China and the U.S. widened to their highest in 16 years on Wednesday, as investors speculated that China's central bank would ease monetary policy further after a surprise rate cut, even if it puts the yuan under pressure.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly cut key policy rates for the second time in three months on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that the authorities are ramping up monetary easing efforts to boost a sputtering economic recovery. And markets widely expect the PBOC to loosen monetary policy further.

Earlier in the session, the PBOC also ramped up liquidity injection by offering the most short-term cash through seven-day reverse repos in open market operations since February.

China remains an outlier among global central banks as it has loosened monetary policy to shore up a stalling recovery whereas others, particularly the United States, have been in tightening cycles as they battle high inflation.

But the divergent monetary policy paths between the world's two largest economies widened the yield gap to 164 basis points between China's benchmark 10-year government bonds and U.S Treasuries s - the highest since February 2007.

""The significant yield gap, the largest since 2007, could be a key reason why capital remains planted in US dollars and US Treasuries for the time being,"" said David Chao, global market strategist at Asia Pacific at Invesco.

""More broadly, recent economic data releases in China have been disappointing, while those in the U.S. have surprised to the upside.""

The widening yield gap reduced foreign appetite in China's onshore yuan bonds, with latest official data showing overseas investors' holding declined in July.

Tumbling credit growth and rising deflation risks in July warranted more monetary easing measures to arrest the slowdown, market watchers said, while default risks at some major property developers and missed payments by a private wealth manager also hurt confidence in China's financial markets.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator will continue to carefully review issuer filings, it said on Wednesday in response to a Reuters report that Chinese offshore issuers are toning down China-related business risks in their listing documents.

""Any issuer who chooses to access the U.S. capital markets must comply with our federal securities laws and regulations,"" a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday.

""Our staff will continue its long-standing practice of carefully reviewing issuer filings and commenting to the issuer when appropriate.""

China's securities regulator last month asked domestic law firms to refrain from including negative descriptions of China's policies or its business and legal environment in initial public offering prospectuses, Reuters previously reported. China law firms are now scrambling to comply with that guidance.

In response to the Reuters Tuesday report, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, urged SEC chair Gary Gensler to ""take action to protect American retirees and investors from these deceptive Chinese firms.""

Russian attack damages grain silos at Ukraine's Danube port of Reni - Kyiv,"[1/4] A grain warehouse heavily damaged by a Russian drone attack is seen at a compound of a port on the Danube, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Odesa region, Ukraine August 16, 2023.

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russian drone strikes damaged grain silos and warehouses at the Ukrainian river port of Reni on the Danube, a vital wartime route for Ukrainian food exports, senior officials said on Wednesday.

Russian strikes on port infrastructure on the Danube in recent weeks have piled pressure on Ukrainian food exports after Moscow quit a year-old deal that had allowed Kyiv to ship out grain via the Black Sea.

""Russian terrorists attacked Odesa region twice last night with attack drones,"" regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram. ""The main target is port and grain infrastructure in the south of the region.""

Photos released by the governor showed the destroyed metal walls of storage facilities and piles of scattered grain and sunflowers.

The strike targeted the port of Reni, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram. There were no casualties, he said.

An industry source told Reuters the port continued to operate after the attack.

Ukraine's Air Force said it had destroyed 13 Russian-launched drones over the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions in the south. It was not immediately clear how many drones Russia launched.

Ukraine's Danube ports accounted for around a quarter of grain exports before Russia pulled out of a U.N.-backed deal to provide safe passage for the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea in July

The ports have since become the main route out, with grain also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Russia attacked Izmail - Ukraine's main inland port across the Danube River from Romania, sending global food prices higher as it ramped up its use of force to prevent Ukraine from exporting grain. read more

The drone attacks destroyed buildings in the port and halted ships as they prepared to arrive there to load with Ukrainian grain in defiance of a de facto blockade Russia reimposed in mid-July.

Yield gap between China and US widens to highest since 2007 after surprise rate cut,"A staff member wearing a face mask walks past United States and Chinese flags set up before a meeting between Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, Saturday, July 8, 2023.

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Yield differentials between China and the U.S. widened to their highest in 16 years on Wednesday, as investors speculated that China's central bank would ease monetary policy further after a surprise rate cut, even if it puts the yuan under pressure.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly cut key policy rates for the second time in three months on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that the authorities are ramping up monetary easing efforts to boost a sputtering economic recovery. And markets widely expect the PBOC to loosen monetary policy further.

Earlier in the session, the PBOC also ramped up liquidity injection by offering the most short-term cash through seven-day reverse repos in open market operations since February.

China remains an outlier among global central banks as it has loosened monetary policy to shore up a stalling recovery whereas others, particularly the United States, have been in tightening cycles as they battle high inflation.

But the divergent monetary policy paths between the world's two largest economies widened the yield gap to 164 basis points between China's benchmark 10-year government bonds and U.S Treasuries s - the highest since February 2007.

""The significant yield gap, the largest since 2007, could be a key reason why capital remains planted in US dollars and US Treasuries for the time being,"" said David Chao, global market strategist at Asia Pacific at Invesco.

""More broadly, recent economic data releases in China have been disappointing, while those in the U.S. have surprised to the upside.""

The widening yield gap reduced foreign appetite in China's onshore yuan bonds, with latest official data showing overseas investors' holding declined in July.

Tumbling credit growth and rising deflation risks in July warranted more monetary easing measures to arrest the slowdown, market watchers said, while default risks at some major property developers and missed payments by a private wealth manager also hurt confidence in China's financial markets.

In derivatives market, one-year interest rate swaps , a gauge that measures investor expectations of future funding costs, fell to 1.84% this week, the lowest since September 2022, suggesting some market participants are pricing in further rate reductions.

But the expectations for further monetary easing and capital outflow risks has pressure on the Chinese yuan to depreciate further. The yuan has lost about 5.5% against the dollar since the start of the year, making it one of the worst performing Asian currencies.

""The PBOC will need to do more to manage the pace of yuan depreciation,"" Eugenia Victorino, head of Asia strategy at SEB, said in a note.

US would welcome any Iranian steps to slow nuclear program,"WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday he could not confirm a report that Iran slowed its pace of amassing near-weapons-grade enriched uranium but would welcome any Iranian steps to de-escalate its ""growing nuclear threat.""

Blinken also told reporters that Iran moving U.S. detainees into house arrest was not related to any other aspect of U.S. policy toward Iran, which he said reflected a strategy of deterrence, pressure and diplomacy.

On Thursday, sources said Iran may free five detained U.S. citizens as part of a deal to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian funds in South Korea. Iran allowed four detained U.S. citizens to move into house arrest from prison. A fifth was already under home confinement.

The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported Iran had significantly slowed the pace at which it was accumulating near-weapons-grade enriched uranium and diluted some of its stockpile, moves that could help ease tensions with the U.S. and revive broader talks over Iran's nuclear program.

""Of course, we would welcome any steps that Iran takes to actually deescalate the growing nuclear threat that it has posed since the United States got out of the Iran nuclear deal,"" Blinken told a news conference, alluding to former U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 abandonment of that agreement.

Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and six major powers, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear program to make it harder for it to obtain an atomic weapon - an ambition it denies - in return for relief from U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken meets with Iranian-American writer Roya Hakakian, Iranian-American activist Sherry Hakimi and British-Iranian actress and activist Nazanin Boniadi to discuss the recent protests in Iran at the U.S. State Department in Washington, U.S., October 14, 2022. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

When asked if Iran's reported slowdown and the release of the detainees to house arrest was in any way linked, Blinken said they were different issues. ""The agreement that we're pursuing to bring home those who are wrongfully detained in Iran is an entirely separate matter that we want to bring to a successful conclusion, and that's what I'm focused on.""

WRONGFULLY DETAINED

The deal announced last week has left out Shahab Dalili, 60, a U.S. permanent resident who has been detained in Iran since 2016, even though his family have repeatedly pleaded with the Biden administration to include him in the deal or at least label him ""wrongfully detained"".

Dalili has started a hunger strike in the Evin prison in Iran where he has been jailed, his son said on Monday.

The State Department makes the legal determination of wrongful detainment, which effectively means the U.S. government views the charges as politically motivated and false.

Blinken emphasized that the agreement included U.S. citizens who have all been designated as wrongfully detained and said Washington would continue to examine other cases.

""For reasons of privacy, I can't talk about any individual cases. I can simply say that as a matter of policy, we're constantly reviewing whether any particular individual, whether an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, who was incarcerated in another country is wrongfully detained,"" he said.

SHANGHAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group's (9988.HK) work communication and collaboration platform DingTalk will split from the company's cloud division, according to two sources close to the company.

The sources could not confirm the exact timing of the split and also did not confirm news reported by Chinese media outlet Caixin on Wednesday that DingTalk would pursue its own IPO in the near future.

DingTalk will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alibaba Holding Group and there would be no impact on its services, one source said.

Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Business Group did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the matter.

Though the Slack-like DingTalk will split structurally from Alibaba's Cloud Business Intelligence unit, the sources said it would continue to work closely with the cloud division technology-wise.

Alibaba's cloud division is itself working towards a public listing, having flagged it would be the first of the Group's newly created six business units to IPO.

The tech giant announced the split of its business in March and has said the cloud division was likely to IPO by May next year.

Alibaba Group last week reported better than expected results for its first quarter, but sales for its Cloud Intelligence Business Group, a major growth driver outside of e-commerce, reported the smallest revenue growth among the group's business units of 4%.

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The South African rand edged higher on Wednesday, reversing some of the losses incurred the previous day after its biggest trading partner China cut key policy rates.

At 1538 GMT, the rand traded at 19.0750 against the dollar , over 0.3% stronger than its previous close.

The rand had weakened earlier this week on mounting worries over the health of China's economy.

The dollar last traded around 0.02% weaker against a basket of global currencies.

The rand was little moved by Statistics South Africa data showing the country's retail sales (ZARET=ECI) fell 0.9% year on the year in June after declining by a revised 1.6% in May. Analysts polled by Reuters expected a decline of 0.2% year on year.

""Consumers remain financially constrained dealing with elevated living costs, high interest rates and accordingly lower purchasing power,"" Investec analyst Lara Hodes said in a research note.

Retail sales have contracted in annual terms every month since December 2022, with rolling power blackouts a contributing factor.

Shares on the South African Stock Exchange fell, with the blue-chip Top-40 index (.JTOPI) ending 1% lower. South Africa's benchmark 2030 government bond was marginally stronger in early deals, with the yield down 1 basis point to 10.345%.

BENGALURU, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Investment firm GQG Partners bought an 8.1% stake in India's Adani Power (ADAN.NS) for $1.1 billion via block deals on Wednesday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Multiple GQG funds bought around 152.1 million shares, as per data from BSE, one of India's top stock exchanges, from Worldwide Emerging Market Holding and Afro ASIA Trade And Investments.

Adani Power and GQG did not immediately respond to Reuters' request seeking comments.

The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based GQG has made several other investments in the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate's companies previously.

The investment comes days after Deloitte quit as auditor for one of the conglomerate's key business units, renewing investor concerns even as the group slowly recovers from a report by U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research, released in January.

The report, which alleged improper use of tax havens and concerns over the conglomerate's debt levels - something it denies - wiped out nearly $147 billion from the market cap of the group's listed entities.

Though shares of the group companies have rebounded, they are still down around $100 billion in value.

Adani Ports had said that Deloitte's reason for quitting as its auditor was ""not convincing or sufficient to warrant such a move.

Meanwhile, India's market regulator has sought 15 more days to complete a probe into the Adani Group's dealings with certain offshore entities.

"Iraq set in 'battle' against dollar smugglers, c.bank governor says","Summary Iraq trying to crack down on dollar smuggling, including to Iran

Baghdad faces hard task of balancing Washington, Tehran

Banking sector could shrink with new regulations

Govt, c.bank eye modernizing, digitizing economy

BAGHDAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Iraq has made strides implementing U.S. dollar supply restrictions targeting Iran but faces an uphill battle with a banking system unaccustomed to strict oversight and persistent currency smugglers, central bank governor Ali al-Allaq said.

""It is really a battle, because the people benefiting from this situation and those harmed (by the new measures) will try in various ways to continue their illegal activities,"" Allaq said in an interview with Reuters.

Allaq did not mention Iran by name and said he did not have data on how much of Iraq's dollars been smuggled to Iran or other neighbouring countries, including Turkey and Syria, before the United States tightened regulations in November.

The U.S. measures that aim to enforce sanctions on Iran are a sensitive matter in a country that has often been a front line in the rivalry between Washington and Tehran.

Iraq's government is reliant on Washington's continued goodwill to ensure oil revenues and finances do not face U.S. censure, but it came to power with the support of powerful, Tehran-backed groups and so cannot afford to alienate Iran.

The latter groups have accused the U.S. of meddling in Iraq's internal affairs and creating a currency crisis, as businesses either struggling or unwilling to abide by the new measures sourced dollars from exchange shops, driving down the value of the Iraqi dinar.

Iraq has more than $100 billion dollars in reserves, Allaq said, but could not freely intervene in the market to bring the rate down due to the restrictions.

Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Fed barred 14 Iraqi banks from conducting dollar transactions as part of a wider crackdown on dollar smuggling to Iran via the Iraqi banking system, U.S. officials said.

Allaq said that action related to transfers from 2022, before a new platform that aimed to improve transparency went live. He said the central bank was undertaking a review of the banking sector and introducing new regulations that he said would likely see some banks close.

""It would be very normal in the coming period to see a reduction in the (number of private banks),"" he said.

""There are always side-effects, but at the same time we have a responsibility to protect the country's interests by trying to find the necessary means for monitoring and oversight so as not to expose the country to any issues on this front,"" he said.

'TRANSFORMATION'

The U.S. measures have targeted Iraq's so-called dollar auction, where the central bank requests dollars from the U.S. Federal Reserve before selling them to commercial banks, which in turn sell the funds to businesses in the highly import-dependent economy.

U.S. and Iraqi officials have said the auction allowed large sums of money to be illegitimately acquired by groups who would provide fake invoices and then either transfer or physically smuggle the funds to neighbouring countries, chiefly Iran.

A feature of a highly informal economy, the system was also used by thousands of small businesses that are not registered with the state, Allaq said, a widespread phenomenon in Iraq that allows them to dodge taxes and customs fees.

Since January the central bank has asked banks to provide detailed information on senders and recipients of transfers via an online platform.

When companies began trying to use the platform in January, less than 20% of requests were approved by U.S authorities, Allaq said. That number had now risen to around 85 percent, signalling growing ease with the new regulations, he said.

Allaq said that tighter regulations along with government plans to promote digital payment were forcing a wider shift in the Iraq economy in a country where cash remains king and the majority of adults do not have bank accounts.

""It is not just an electronic platform, it will lead to a total reorganisation of trade and the movement of money, and control on a lot of avenues for suspicious activity.""

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on three entities it accused of being tied to arms deals between North Korea and Russia as Washington cracked down on those seeking to support Russia's war in Ukraine.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said that Russia has increasingly been forced to turn to North Korea and other allies to sustain its war in Ukraine as it expends munitions and loses heavy equipment on the battlefield.

The action is the latest by Washington, which has imposed rafts of sanctions targeting Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and turned cities to rubble.

“The United States continues to root out illicit financial networks that seek to channel support from North Korea to Russia’s war machine,” Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said in the statement.

“Alongside our allies and partners, we remain committed to exposing and disrupting the arms trade underpinning Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine.""

Russia's embassy in Washington and North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The entities targeted in Wednesday's action are Limited Liability Company Verus, Defense Engineering Limited Liability Partnership and Versor S.R.O.

The Treasury said Slovakian national Ashot Mkrtychev, already under U.S. sanctions, is the president of Versor, founder and owner of Verus and director of Defense Engineering.

Washington accused Mkrtychev of negotiating with North Korean and Russian officials to organize potential plans to transfer over two dozens kinds of weapons and munitions to Russia in exchange for goods to North Korea.

Wednesday's action freezes any US assets of those designated and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with the sanctioned entities can also be hit with punitive measures.

Allaq did not mention Iran by name and said he did not have data on how much of Iraq's dollars been smuggled to Iran or other neighbouring countries, including Turkey and Syria, before the United States tightened regulations in November.

The U.S. measures that aim to enforce sanctions on Iran are a sensitive matter in a country that has often been a front line in the rivalry between Washington and Tehran.

Iraq's government is reliant on Washington's continued goodwill to ensure oil revenues and finances do not face U.S. censure, but it came to power with the support of powerful, Tehran-backed groups and so cannot afford to alienate Iran.

The latter groups have accused the U.S. of meddling in Iraq's internal affairs and creating a currency crisis, as businesses either struggling or unwilling to abide by the new measures sourced dollars from exchange shops, driving down the value of the Iraqi dinar.

Iraq has more than $100 billion dollars in reserves, Allaq said, but could not freely intervene in the market to bring the rate down due to the restrictions.

Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Fed barred 14 Iraqi banks from conducting dollar transactions as part of a wider crackdown on dollar smuggling to Iran via the Iraqi banking system, U.S. officials said.

Allaq said that action related to transfers from 2022, before a new platform that aimed to improve transparency went live. He said the central bank was undertaking a review of the banking sector and introducing new regulations that he said would likely see some banks close.

""It would be very normal in the coming period to see a reduction in the (number of private banks),"" he said.

""There are always side-effects, but at the same time we have a responsibility to protect the country's interests by trying to find the necessary means for monitoring and oversight so as not to expose the country to any issues on this front,"" he said.

'TRANSFORMATION'

The U.S. measures have targeted Iraq's so-called dollar auction, where the central bank requests dollars from the U.S. Federal Reserve before selling them to commercial banks, which in turn sell the funds to businesses in the highly import-dependent economy.

U.S. and Iraqi officials have said the auction allowed large sums of money to be illegitimately acquired by groups who would provide fake invoices and then either transfer or physically smuggle the funds to neighbouring countries, chiefly Iran.

A feature of a highly informal economy, the system was also used by thousands of small businesses that are not registered with the state, Allaq said, a widespread phenomenon in Iraq that allows them to dodge taxes and customs fees.

Since January the central bank has asked banks to provide detailed information on senders and recipients of transfers via an online platform.

When companies began trying to use the platform in January, less than 20% of requests were approved by U.S authorities, Allaq said. That number had now risen to around 85 percent, signalling growing ease with the new regulations, he said.

Allaq said that tighter regulations along with government plans to promote digital payment were forcing a wider shift in the Iraq economy in a country where cash remains king and the majority of adults do not have bank accounts.

""It is not just an electronic platform, it will lead to a total reorganisation of trade and the movement of money, and control on a lot of avenues for suspicious activity.""

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator will continue to carefully review issuer filings, it said on Wednesday in response to a Reuters report that Chinese offshore issuers are toning down China-related business risks in their listing documents.

""Any issuer who chooses to access the U.S. capital markets must comply with our federal securities laws and regulations,"" a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday.

""Our staff will continue its long-standing practice of carefully reviewing issuer filings and commenting to the issuer when appropriate.""

China's securities regulator last month asked domestic law firms to refrain from including negative descriptions of China's policies or its business and legal environment in initial public offering prospectuses, Reuters previously reported. China law firms are now scrambling to comply with that guidance.

In response to the Reuters Tuesday report, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, urged SEC chair Gary Gensler to ""take action to protect American retirees and investors from these deceptive Chinese firms.""

Russian attack damages grain silos at Ukraine's Danube port of Reni - Kyiv,"[1/4] A grain warehouse heavily damaged by a Russian drone attack is seen at a compound of a port on the Danube, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Odesa region, Ukraine August 16, 2023.

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russian drone strikes damaged grain silos and warehouses at the Ukrainian river port of Reni on the Danube, a vital wartime route for Ukrainian food exports, senior officials said on Wednesday.

Russian strikes on port infrastructure on the Danube in recent weeks have piled pressure on Ukrainian food exports after Moscow quit a year-old deal that had allowed Kyiv to ship out grain via the Black Sea.

""Russian terrorists attacked Odesa region twice last night with attack drones,"" regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram. ""The main target is port and grain infrastructure in the south of the region.""

Photos released by the governor showed the destroyed metal walls of storage facilities and piles of scattered grain and sunflowers.

The strike targeted the port of Reni, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram. There were no casualties, he said.

An industry source told Reuters the port continued to operate after the attack.

Ukraine's Air Force said it had destroyed 13 Russian-launched drones over the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions in the south. It was not immediately clear how many drones Russia launched.

Ukraine's Danube ports accounted for around a quarter of grain exports before Russia pulled out of a U.N.-backed deal to provide safe passage for the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea in July

The ports have since become the main route out, with grain also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Russia attacked Izmail - Ukraine's main inland port across the Danube River from Romania, sending global food prices higher as it ramped up its use of force to prevent Ukraine from exporting grain. read more

The drone attacks destroyed buildings in the port and halted ships as they prepared to arrive there to load with Ukrainian grain in defiance of a de facto blockade Russia reimposed in mid-July.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on three entities it accused of being tied to arms deals between North Korea and Russia as Washington cracked down on those seeking to support Russia's war in Ukraine.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said that Russia has increasingly been forced to turn to North Korea and other allies to sustain its war in Ukraine as it expends munitions and loses heavy equipment on the battlefield.

The action is the latest by Washington, which has imposed rafts of sanctions targeting Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and turned cities to rubble.

“The United States continues to root out illicit financial networks that seek to channel support from North Korea to Russia’s war machine,” Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said in the statement.

“Alongside our allies and partners, we remain committed to exposing and disrupting the arms trade underpinning Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine.""

Russia's embassy in Washington and North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The entities targeted in Wednesday's action are Limited Liability Company Verus, Defense Engineering Limited Liability Partnership and Versor S.R.O.

The Treasury said Slovakian national Ashot Mkrtychev, already under U.S. sanctions, is the president of Versor, founder and owner of Verus and director of Defense Engineering.

Washington accused Mkrtychev of negotiating with North Korean and Russian officials to organize potential plans to transfer over two dozens kinds of weapons and munitions to Russia in exchange for goods to North Korea.

Wednesday's action freezes any US assets of those designated and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with the sanctioned entities can also be hit with punitive measures.

Seaside screen brings magic of movies to Gaza years after cinemas closed,"GAZA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - With car tyres, rocks and mounds of sand as seats, Palestinians of all ages have been enjoying a rare trip to the movies at a big-screen event on the Gaza beachfront.

The open-air show - with a playlist including the animated children's comedy ""Ferdinand"" - was for many viewers a first experience of a projected film since the impoverished enclave's last cinema closed more than three decades ago.

Hosted by ""The Sea is Ours"" cafe, the screenings were designed to promote issues of culture and history approved by the conservative Islamist Hamas government.

They left some in the audience longing for more.

""I hope one day there will be a cinema, so I can go to the cinema and eat popcorn,"" said 13-year-old Mohammad Zidan as other children lolled in the sand, giggling at the cartoon.

Cinema once flourished in Gaza, with Palestinians flocking to see Arab, Western and Asian films, but the movie houses were torched in the First Intifada in 1987 and then burned down again in 1996 during a wave of internal violence.

The last cinema, long abandoned, is now a haven for bats.

While Gazans have been able to go to movie screenings which are held from time to time at theatres and other venues, such a full bill of films, being shown over several weeks at the venue, is a rare treat.

""We can get movies on mobile phones, but this is something new and is nice,"" said 15-year-old Hadeel Hejji.

Ali Mhana, 35, the cafe owner and local playwright, said he had never been to a regular cinema.

""At the sea, you don't need to look for an audience, the sea has its own. People are here all the time, including children, who get attracted by the sound and image and come to watch the movies,"" Mhana said.

SHANGHAI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group's (9988.HK) work communication and collaboration platform DingTalk will split from the company's cloud division, according to two sources close to the company.

The sources could not confirm the exact timing of the split and also did not confirm news reported by Chinese media outlet Caixin on Wednesday that DingTalk would pursue its own IPO in the near future.

DingTalk will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alibaba Holding Group and there would be no impact on its services, one source said.

Alibaba's Cloud Intelligence Business Group did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the matter.

Though the Slack-like DingTalk will split structurally from Alibaba's Cloud Business Intelligence unit, the sources said it would continue to work closely with the cloud division technology-wise.

Alibaba's cloud division is itself working towards a public listing, having flagged it would be the first of the Group's newly created six business units to IPO.

The tech giant announced the split of its business in March and has said the cloud division was likely to IPO by May next year.

Alibaba Group last week reported better than expected results for its first quarter, but sales for its Cloud Intelligence Business Group, a major growth driver outside of e-commerce, reported the smallest revenue growth among the group's business units of 4%.

South African rand edges higher against dollar,"South African Rand coins are seen in this illustration picture taken October 30, 2020. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/Illustration Acquire Licensing Rights

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The South African rand edged higher on Wednesday, reversing some of the losses incurred the previous day after its biggest trading partner China cut key policy rates.

At 1538 GMT, the rand traded at 19.0750 against the dollar , over 0.3% stronger than its previous close.

The rand had weakened earlier this week on mounting worries over the health of China's economy.

The dollar last traded around 0.02% weaker against a basket of global currencies.

The rand was little moved by Statistics South Africa data showing the country's retail sales (ZARET=ECI) fell 0.9% year on the year in June after declining by a revised 1.6% in May. Analysts polled by Reuters expected a decline of 0.2% year on year.

""Consumers remain financially constrained dealing with elevated living costs, high interest rates and accordingly lower purchasing power,"" Investec analyst Lara Hodes said in a research note.

Retail sales have contracted in annual terms every month since December 2022, with rolling power blackouts a contributing factor.

Shares on the South African Stock Exchange fell, with the blue-chip Top-40 index (.JTOPI) ending 1% lower. South Africa's benchmark 2030 government bond was marginally stronger in early deals, with the yield down 1 basis point to 10.345%.

BENGALURU, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Investment firm GQG Partners bought an 8.1% stake in India's Adani Power (ADAN.NS) for $1.1 billion via block deals on Wednesday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Multiple GQG funds bought around 152.1 million shares, as per data from BSE, one of India's top stock exchanges, from Worldwide Emerging Market Holding and Afro ASIA Trade And Investments.

Adani Power and GQG did not immediately respond to Reuters' request seeking comments.

The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based GQG has made several other investments in the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate's companies previously.

The investment comes days after Deloitte quit as auditor for one of the conglomerate's key business units, renewing investor concerns even as the group slowly recovers from a report by U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research, released in January.

The report, which alleged improper use of tax havens and concerns over the conglomerate's debt levels - something it denies - wiped out nearly $147 billion from the market cap of the group's listed entities.

Though shares of the group companies have rebounded, they are still down around $100 billion in value.

Adani Ports had said that Deloitte's reason for quitting as its auditor was ""not convincing or sufficient to warrant such a move.

Meanwhile, India's market regulator has sought 15 more days to complete a probe into the Adani Group's dealings with certain offshore entities.

Mexico's Sheinbaum grows lead for ruling party presidential ticket -poll,"Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum holds a rally at Macroplaza Iztapalapa, pursuing to be the ruling MORENA party's candidate for the 2024 presidential election, in Mexico City, Mexico, August 1, 2023. REUTERS/Henry Romero/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has grown her lead to a 13-point advantage in the contest to be the ruling party's candidate in Mexico's 2024 presidential election, a poll published on Wednesday in newspaper El Universal showed.

With less than a month until the candidate is announced, the survey showed Sheinbaum with 35% support to be the nominee of the leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), followed by former Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard at 22%.

The survey of 1,000 adults by polling firm Buendia & Marquez also showed Sheinbaum was slightly more popular with respondents who identified with the opposition.

Both candidates have long been favorites for the MORENA ticket and ranked far ahead of the poll's next-best placed candidates, including former Interior Minister Adan Augusto Lopez, who had 7% support.

MORENA, lifted by the strong personal approval ratings of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is heavily favored to win the June 2024 election. That has prompted many analysts to view the MORENA contest as an almost de facto presidential race.

The poll showed that Ebrard was the best-known candidate, being recognized by 70% of respondents, while Sheinbaum followed closely at 69%.

Both resigned from their positions this year to compete in MORENA's internal contest, which formally kicked off on June 19. A winner is due to be announced on Sept. 6, and is expected to be based on voters' preferences.

The face-to-face voter survey was carried out from Aug. 10 to Aug. 14 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.53 percentage points, Buendia & Marquez said.

A survey published in June by Buendia & Marquez showed Sheinbaum polling with a 12-point lead with 34% support and Ebrard with 22% on the question of who should be MORENA's presidential candidate.

If Sheinbaum wins the nomination, Mexico could see women at the head of the presidential election's two top tickets.

Several polls have shown Senator Xochitl Galvez is well positioned to win the nomination for an alliance of leading opposition parties.

"Iraq set in 'battle' against dollar smugglers, c.bank governor says","Summary Iraq trying to crack down on dollar smuggling, including to Iran

Baghdad faces hard task of balancing Washington, Tehran

Banking sector could shrink with new regulations

Govt, c.bank eye modernizing, digitizing economy

BAGHDAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Iraq has made strides implementing U.S. dollar supply restrictions targeting Iran but faces an uphill battle with a banking system unaccustomed to strict oversight and persistent currency smugglers, central bank governor Ali al-Allaq said.

""It is really a battle, because the people benefiting from this situation and those harmed (by the new measures) will try in various ways to continue their illegal activities,"" Allaq said in an interview with Reuters.

Allaq did not mention Iran by name and said he did not have data on how much of Iraq's dollars been smuggled to Iran or other neighbouring countries, including Turkey and Syria, before the United States tightened regulations in November.

The U.S. measures that aim to enforce sanctions on Iran are a sensitive matter in a country that has often been a front line in the rivalry between Washington and Tehran.

Iraq's government is reliant on Washington's continued goodwill to ensure oil revenues and finances do not face U.S. censure, but it came to power with the support of powerful, Tehran-backed groups and so cannot afford to alienate Iran.

The latter groups have accused the U.S. of meddling in Iraq's internal affairs and creating a currency crisis, as businesses either struggling or unwilling to abide by the new measures sourced dollars from exchange shops, driving down the value of the Iraqi dinar.

Iraq has more than $100 billion dollars in reserves, Allaq said, but could not freely intervene in the market to bring the rate down due to the restrictions.

Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Fed barred 14 Iraqi banks from conducting dollar transactions as part of a wider crackdown on dollar smuggling to Iran via the Iraqi banking system, U.S. officials said.

Allaq said that action related to transfers from 2022, before a new platform that aimed to improve transparency went live. He said the central bank was undertaking a review of the banking sector and introducing new regulations that he said would likely see some banks close.

""It would be very normal in the coming period to see a reduction in the (number of private banks),"" he said.

""There are always side-effects, but at the same time we have a responsibility to protect the country's interests by trying to find the necessary means for monitoring and oversight so as not to expose the country to any issues on this front,"" he said.

'TRANSFORMATION'

The U.S. measures have targeted Iraq's so-called dollar auction, where the central bank requests dollars from the U.S. Federal Reserve before selling them to commercial banks, which in turn sell the funds to businesses in the highly import-dependent economy.

U.S. and Iraqi officials have said the auction allowed large sums of money to be illegitimately acquired by groups who would provide fake invoices and then either transfer or physically smuggle the funds to neighbouring countries, chiefly Iran.

A feature of a highly informal economy, the system was also used by thousands of small businesses that are not registered with the state, Allaq said, a widespread phenomenon in Iraq that allows them to dodge taxes and customs fees.

Since January the central bank has asked banks to provide detailed information on senders and recipients of transfers via an online platform.

When companies began trying to use the platform in January, less than 20% of requests were approved by U.S authorities, Allaq said. That number had now risen to around 85 percent, signalling growing ease with the new regulations, he said.

Allaq said that tighter regulations along with government plans to promote digital payment were forcing a wider shift in the Iraq economy in a country where cash remains king and the majority of adults do not have bank accounts.

""It is not just an electronic platform, it will lead to a total reorganisation of trade and the movement of money, and control on a lot of avenues for suspicious activity.""

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator will continue to carefully review issuer filings, it said on Wednesday in response to a Reuters report that Chinese offshore issuers are toning down China-related business risks in their listing documents.

""Any issuer who chooses to access the U.S. capital markets must comply with our federal securities laws and regulations,"" a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday.

""Our staff will continue its long-standing practice of carefully reviewing issuer filings and commenting to the issuer when appropriate.""

China's securities regulator last month asked domestic law firms to refrain from including negative descriptions of China's policies or its business and legal environment in initial public offering prospectuses, Reuters previously reported. China law firms are now scrambling to comply with that guidance.

In response to the Reuters Tuesday report, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, urged SEC chair Gary Gensler to ""take action to protect American retirees and investors from these deceptive Chinese firms.""

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russian drone strikes damaged grain silos and warehouses at the Ukrainian river port of Reni on the Danube, a vital wartime route for Ukrainian food exports, senior officials said on Wednesday.

Russian strikes on port infrastructure on the Danube in recent weeks have piled pressure on Ukrainian food exports after Moscow quit a year-old deal that had allowed Kyiv to ship out grain via the Black Sea.

""Russian terrorists attacked Odesa region twice last night with attack drones,"" regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram. ""The main target is port and grain infrastructure in the south of the region.""

Photos released by the governor showed the destroyed metal walls of storage facilities and piles of scattered grain and sunflowers.

The strike targeted the port of Reni, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram. There were no casualties, he said.

An industry source told Reuters the port continued to operate after the attack.

Ukraine's Air Force said it had destroyed 13 Russian-launched drones over the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions in the south. It was not immediately clear how many drones Russia launched.

Ukraine's Danube ports accounted for around a quarter of grain exports before Russia pulled out of a U.N.-backed deal to provide safe passage for the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea in July

The ports have since become the main route out, with grain also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Russia attacked Izmail - Ukraine's main inland port across the Danube River from Romania, sending global food prices higher as it ramped up its use of force to prevent Ukraine from exporting grain. read more

The drone attacks destroyed buildings in the port and halted ships as they prepared to arrive there to load with Ukrainian grain in defiance of a de facto blockade Russia reimposed in mid-July.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on three entities it accused of being tied to arms deals between North Korea and Russia as Washington cracked down on those seeking to support Russia's war in Ukraine.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said that Russia has increasingly been forced to turn to North Korea and other allies to sustain its war in Ukraine as it expends munitions and loses heavy equipment on the battlefield.

The action is the latest by Washington, which has imposed rafts of sanctions targeting Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and turned cities to rubble.

“The United States continues to root out illicit financial networks that seek to channel support from North Korea to Russia’s war machine,” Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said in the statement.

“Alongside our allies and partners, we remain committed to exposing and disrupting the arms trade underpinning Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine.""

Russia's embassy in Washington and North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The entities targeted in Wednesday's action are Limited Liability Company Verus, Defense Engineering Limited Liability Partnership and Versor S.R.O.

The Treasury said Slovakian national Ashot Mkrtychev, already under U.S. sanctions, is the president of Versor, founder and owner of Verus and director of Defense Engineering.

Washington accused Mkrtychev of negotiating with North Korean and Russian officials to organize potential plans to transfer over two dozens kinds of weapons and munitions to Russia in exchange for goods to North Korea.

Wednesday's action freezes any US assets of those designated and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with the sanctioned entities can also be hit with punitive measures.

Seaside screen brings magic of movies to Gaza years after cinemas closed,"GAZA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - With car tyres, rocks and mounds of sand as seats, Palestinians of all ages have been enjoying a rare trip to the movies at a big-screen event on the Gaza beachfront.

The open-air show - with a playlist including the animated children's comedy ""Ferdinand"" - was for many viewers a first experience of a projected film since the impoverished enclave's last cinema closed more than three decades ago.

Hosted by ""The Sea is Ours"" cafe, the screenings were designed to promote issues of culture and history approved by the conservative Islamist Hamas government.

They left some in the audience longing for more.

""I hope one day there will be a cinema, so I can go to the cinema and eat popcorn,"" said 13-year-old Mohammad Zidan as other children lolled in the sand, giggling at the cartoon.

Cinema once flourished in Gaza, with Palestinians flocking to see Arab, Western and Asian films, but the movie houses were torched in the First Intifada in 1987 and then burned down again in 1996 during a wave of internal violence.

The last cinema, long abandoned, is now a haven for bats.

While Gazans have been able to go to movie screenings which are held from time to time at theatres and other venues, such a full bill of films, being shown over several weeks at the venue, is a rare treat.

""We can get movies on mobile phones, but this is something new and is nice,"" said 15-year-old Hadeel Hejji.

Ali Mhana, 35, the cafe owner and local playwright, said he had never been to a regular cinema.

""At the sea, you don't need to look for an audience, the sea has its own. People are here all the time, including children, who get attracted by the sound and image and come to watch the movies,"" Mhana said.

REUTERS/Henry Romero/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has grown her lead to a 13-point advantage in the contest to be the ruling party's candidate in Mexico's 2024 presidential election, a poll published on Wednesday in newspaper El Universal showed.

With less than a month until the candidate is announced, the survey showed Sheinbaum with 35% support to be the nominee of the leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), followed by former Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard at 22%.

The survey of 1,000 adults by polling firm Buendia & Marquez also showed Sheinbaum was slightly more popular with respondents who identified with the opposition.

Both candidates have long been favorites for the MORENA ticket and ranked far ahead of the poll's next-best placed candidates, including former Interior Minister Adan Augusto Lopez, who had 7% support.

MORENA, lifted by the strong personal approval ratings of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is heavily favored to win the June 2024 election. That has prompted many analysts to view the MORENA contest as an almost de facto presidential race.

The poll showed that Ebrard was the best-known candidate, being recognized by 70% of respondents, while Sheinbaum followed closely at 69%.

Both resigned from their positions this year to compete in MORENA's internal contest, which formally kicked off on June 19. A winner is due to be announced on Sept. 6, and is expected to be based on voters' preferences.

The face-to-face voter survey was carried out from Aug. 10 to Aug. 14 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.53 percentage points, Buendia & Marquez said.

A survey published in June by Buendia & Marquez showed Sheinbaum polling with a 12-point lead with 34% support and Ebrard with 22% on the question of who should be MORENA's presidential candidate.

If Sheinbaum wins the nomination, Mexico could see women at the head of the presidential election's two top tickets.

Several polls have shown Senator Xochitl Galvez is well positioned to win the nomination for an alliance of leading opposition parties.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The death toll after Monday's explosion near the capital of the Dominican Republic has risen to 25, news agency AFP said in a report on Wednesday, citing local emergency services.

After the explosion at a business in San Cristobal, some 14 miles (23 km) from the capital Santo Domingo, the national health service had said that initial victims included a four-month-old baby.

According to the national health service the toll has risen to 25 including the bodies that have been recovered from the wreckage and people who later died in hospital, AFP quoted civil defense deputy director Delfin Antonio Rodriguez as saying.

In its latest bulletin late on Tuesday, the country's Emergency Operation Center (COE) said 59 people were wounded in the explosion and 10 people were unaccounted for.

BENGALURU, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Investment firm GQG Partners bought an 8.1% stake in India's Adani Power (ADAN.NS) for $1.1 billion via block deals on Wednesday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

Multiple GQG funds bought around 152.1 million shares, as per data from BSE, one of India's top stock exchanges, from Worldwide Emerging Market Holding and Afro ASIA Trade And Investments.

Adani Power and GQG did not immediately respond to Reuters' request seeking comments.

The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based GQG has made several other investments in the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate's companies previously.

The investment comes days after Deloitte quit as auditor for one of the conglomerate's key business units, renewing investor concerns even as the group slowly recovers from a report by U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research, released in January.

The report, which alleged improper use of tax havens and concerns over the conglomerate's debt levels - something it denies - wiped out nearly $147 billion from the market cap of the group's listed entities.

Though shares of the group companies have rebounded, they are still down around $100 billion in value.

Adani Ports had said that Deloitte's reason for quitting as its auditor was ""not convincing or sufficient to warrant such a move.

Meanwhile, India's market regulator has sought 15 more days to complete a probe into the Adani Group's dealings with certain offshore entities.

Romanian Black Sea port shipped 8.1 mln tonnes of Ukrainian grain in January-July,"A view of the cereal terminal with grain silo in the Black Sea port of Constanta, Romania, May 11, 2022. REUTERS/Anca Cernat/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BUCHAREST, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine shipped 8.1 million tonnes of grain through the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta in the first seven months of the year, the port authority told Reuters, with the pace slowing in July when Russia began attacking infrastructure at its inland ports.

The Danube river is Ukraine's last waterborne route to export grain after access to its own Black Sea ports was cut off after Russia in mid-July left a safe passage grain corridor agreement brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Since then, Russia has attacked Danube ports repeatedly.

Constanta Port Authority data showed 8.1 million metric tonnes of Ukrainian grain left port in the first seven months, compared with 7.5 million tonnes by end-June.

Ukrainian grain competes for space in Constanta, which traditionally handles Romania's crop exports and those of its landlocked neighbours, including Hungary and Serbia.

Overall, it handled 18.9 million tonnes of grain in the first seven months of this year, the Constanta port authority told Reuters.

At its peak before the war in Ukraine, Constanta has handled 25 million tonnes in a year, but some port operators said the record will be topped as many have invested in boosting their capacity.

Ukraine's Danube ports accounted for around a quarter of grain exports before Russia withdrew from the U.N.-backed deal.

Its Danube ports have since become the main route out, with grain also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Romanian Transport Minister Sorin Grindeanu said European Union and NATO state Romania aimed to double the monthly transit capacity of Ukrainian grain to Constanta to 4 million tonnes in the coming months.

Various EU-funded connecting infrastructure projects were underway or pending in Romania, Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova, Grindeanu and representatives from the European Commission and the U.S. State Department said.

"Iraq set in 'battle' against dollar smugglers, c.bank governor says","Summary Iraq trying to crack down on dollar smuggling, including to Iran

Baghdad faces hard task of balancing Washington, Tehran

Banking sector could shrink with new regulations

Govt, c.bank eye modernizing, digitizing economy

BAGHDAD, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Iraq has made strides implementing U.S. dollar supply restrictions targeting Iran but faces an uphill battle with a banking system unaccustomed to strict oversight and persistent currency smugglers, central bank governor Ali al-Allaq said.

""It is really a battle, because the people benefiting from this situation and those harmed (by the new measures) will try in various ways to continue their illegal activities,"" Allaq said in an interview with Reuters.

Allaq did not mention Iran by name and said he did not have data on how much of Iraq's dollars been smuggled to Iran or other neighbouring countries, including Turkey and Syria, before the United States tightened regulations in November.

The U.S. measures that aim to enforce sanctions on Iran are a sensitive matter in a country that has often been a front line in the rivalry between Washington and Tehran.

Iraq's government is reliant on Washington's continued goodwill to ensure oil revenues and finances do not face U.S. censure, but it came to power with the support of powerful, Tehran-backed groups and so cannot afford to alienate Iran.

The latter groups have accused the U.S. of meddling in Iraq's internal affairs and creating a currency crisis, as businesses either struggling or unwilling to abide by the new measures sourced dollars from exchange shops, driving down the value of the Iraqi dinar.

Iraq has more than $100 billion dollars in reserves, Allaq said, but could not freely intervene in the market to bring the rate down due to the restrictions.

Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Fed barred 14 Iraqi banks from conducting dollar transactions as part of a wider crackdown on dollar smuggling to Iran via the Iraqi banking system, U.S. officials said.

Allaq said that action related to transfers from 2022, before a new platform that aimed to improve transparency went live. He said the central bank was undertaking a review of the banking sector and introducing new regulations that he said would likely see some banks close.

""It would be very normal in the coming period to see a reduction in the (number of private banks),"" he said.

""There are always side-effects, but at the same time we have a responsibility to protect the country's interests by trying to find the necessary means for monitoring and oversight so as not to expose the country to any issues on this front,"" he said.

'TRANSFORMATION'

The U.S. measures have targeted Iraq's so-called dollar auction, where the central bank requests dollars from the U.S. Federal Reserve before selling them to commercial banks, which in turn sell the funds to businesses in the highly import-dependent economy.

U.S. and Iraqi officials have said the auction allowed large sums of money to be illegitimately acquired by groups who would provide fake invoices and then either transfer or physically smuggle the funds to neighbouring countries, chiefly Iran.

A feature of a highly informal economy, the system was also used by thousands of small businesses that are not registered with the state, Allaq said, a widespread phenomenon in Iraq that allows them to dodge taxes and customs fees.

Since January the central bank has asked banks to provide detailed information on senders and recipients of transfers via an online platform.

When companies began trying to use the platform in January, less than 20% of requests were approved by U.S authorities, Allaq said. That number had now risen to around 85 percent, signalling growing ease with the new regulations, he said.

Allaq said that tighter regulations along with government plans to promote digital payment were forcing a wider shift in the Iraq economy in a country where cash remains king and the majority of adults do not have bank accounts.

""It is not just an electronic platform, it will lead to a total reorganisation of trade and the movement of money, and control on a lot of avenues for suspicious activity.""

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator will continue to carefully review issuer filings, it said on Wednesday in response to a Reuters report that Chinese offshore issuers are toning down China-related business risks in their listing documents.

""Any issuer who chooses to access the U.S. capital markets must comply with our federal securities laws and regulations,"" a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday.

""Our staff will continue its long-standing practice of carefully reviewing issuer filings and commenting to the issuer when appropriate.""

China's securities regulator last month asked domestic law firms to refrain from including negative descriptions of China's policies or its business and legal environment in initial public offering prospectuses, Reuters previously reported. China law firms are now scrambling to comply with that guidance.

In response to the Reuters Tuesday report, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, urged SEC chair Gary Gensler to ""take action to protect American retirees and investors from these deceptive Chinese firms.""

Russian attack damages grain silos at Ukraine's Danube port of Reni - Kyiv,"[1/4] A grain warehouse heavily damaged by a Russian drone attack is seen at a compound of a port on the Danube, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Odesa region, Ukraine August 16, 2023.

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russian drone strikes damaged grain silos and warehouses at the Ukrainian river port of Reni on the Danube, a vital wartime route for Ukrainian food exports, senior officials said on Wednesday.

Russian strikes on port infrastructure on the Danube in recent weeks have piled pressure on Ukrainian food exports after Moscow quit a year-old deal that had allowed Kyiv to ship out grain via the Black Sea.

""Russian terrorists attacked Odesa region twice last night with attack drones,"" regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram. ""The main target is port and grain infrastructure in the south of the region.""

Photos released by the governor showed the destroyed metal walls of storage facilities and piles of scattered grain and sunflowers.

The strike targeted the port of Reni, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram. There were no casualties, he said.

An industry source told Reuters the port continued to operate after the attack.

Ukraine's Air Force said it had destroyed 13 Russian-launched drones over the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions in the south. It was not immediately clear how many drones Russia launched.

Ukraine's Danube ports accounted for around a quarter of grain exports before Russia pulled out of a U.N.-backed deal to provide safe passage for the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea in July

The ports have since become the main route out, with grain also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Russia attacked Izmail - Ukraine's main inland port across the Danube River from Romania, sending global food prices higher as it ramped up its use of force to prevent Ukraine from exporting grain. read more

The drone attacks destroyed buildings in the port and halted ships as they prepared to arrive there to load with Ukrainian grain in defiance of a de facto blockade Russia reimposed in mid-July.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on three entities it accused of being tied to arms deals between North Korea and Russia as Washington cracked down on those seeking to support Russia's war in Ukraine.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said that Russia has increasingly been forced to turn to North Korea and other allies to sustain its war in Ukraine as it expends munitions and loses heavy equipment on the battlefield.

The action is the latest by Washington, which has imposed rafts of sanctions targeting Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and turned cities to rubble.

“The United States continues to root out illicit financial networks that seek to channel support from North Korea to Russia’s war machine,” Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said in the statement.

“Alongside our allies and partners, we remain committed to exposing and disrupting the arms trade underpinning Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine.""

Russia's embassy in Washington and North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The entities targeted in Wednesday's action are Limited Liability Company Verus, Defense Engineering Limited Liability Partnership and Versor S.R.O.

The Treasury said Slovakian national Ashot Mkrtychev, already under U.S. sanctions, is the president of Versor, founder and owner of Verus and director of Defense Engineering.

Washington accused Mkrtychev of negotiating with North Korean and Russian officials to organize potential plans to transfer over two dozens kinds of weapons and munitions to Russia in exchange for goods to North Korea.

Wednesday's action freezes any US assets of those designated and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with the sanctioned entities can also be hit with punitive measures.

Seaside screen brings magic of movies to Gaza years after cinemas closed,"GAZA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - With car tyres, rocks and mounds of sand as seats, Palestinians of all ages have been enjoying a rare trip to the movies at a big-screen event on the Gaza beachfront.

The open-air show - with a playlist including the animated children's comedy ""Ferdinand"" - was for many viewers a first experience of a projected film since the impoverished enclave's last cinema closed more than three decades ago.

Hosted by ""The Sea is Ours"" cafe, the screenings were designed to promote issues of culture and history approved by the conservative Islamist Hamas government.

They left some in the audience longing for more.

""I hope one day there will be a cinema, so I can go to the cinema and eat popcorn,"" said 13-year-old Mohammad Zidan as other children lolled in the sand, giggling at the cartoon.

Cinema once flourished in Gaza, with Palestinians flocking to see Arab, Western and Asian films, but the movie houses were torched in the First Intifada in 1987 and then burned down again in 1996 during a wave of internal violence.

The last cinema, long abandoned, is now a haven for bats.

While Gazans have been able to go to movie screenings which are held from time to time at theatres and other venues, such a full bill of films, being shown over several weeks at the venue, is a rare treat.

""We can get movies on mobile phones, but this is something new and is nice,"" said 15-year-old Hadeel Hejji.

Ali Mhana, 35, the cafe owner and local playwright, said he had never been to a regular cinema.

""At the sea, you don't need to look for an audience, the sea has its own. People are here all the time, including children, who get attracted by the sound and image and come to watch the movies,"" Mhana said.

REUTERS/Henry Romero/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has grown her lead to a 13-point advantage in the contest to be the ruling party's candidate in Mexico's 2024 presidential election, a poll published on Wednesday in newspaper El Universal showed.

With less than a month until the candidate is announced, the survey showed Sheinbaum with 35% support to be the nominee of the leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), followed by former Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard at 22%.

The survey of 1,000 adults by polling firm Buendia & Marquez also showed Sheinbaum was slightly more popular with respondents who identified with the opposition.

Both candidates have long been favorites for the MORENA ticket and ranked far ahead of the poll's next-best placed candidates, including former Interior Minister Adan Augusto Lopez, who had 7% support.

MORENA, lifted by the strong personal approval ratings of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is heavily favored to win the June 2024 election. That has prompted many analysts to view the MORENA contest as an almost de facto presidential race.

The poll showed that Ebrard was the best-known candidate, being recognized by 70% of respondents, while Sheinbaum followed closely at 69%.

Both resigned from their positions this year to compete in MORENA's internal contest, which formally kicked off on June 19. A winner is due to be announced on Sept. 6, and is expected to be based on voters' preferences.

The face-to-face voter survey was carried out from Aug. 10 to Aug. 14 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.53 percentage points, Buendia & Marquez said.

A survey published in June by Buendia & Marquez showed Sheinbaum polling with a 12-point lead with 34% support and Ebrard with 22% on the question of who should be MORENA's presidential candidate.

If Sheinbaum wins the nomination, Mexico could see women at the head of the presidential election's two top tickets.

Several polls have shown Senator Xochitl Galvez is well positioned to win the nomination for an alliance of leading opposition parties.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The death toll after Monday's explosion near the capital of the Dominican Republic has risen to 25, news agency AFP said in a report on Wednesday, citing local emergency services.

After the explosion at a business in San Cristobal, some 14 miles (23 km) from the capital Santo Domingo, the national health service had said that initial victims included a four-month-old baby.

According to the national health service the toll has risen to 25 including the bodies that have been recovered from the wreckage and people who later died in hospital, AFP quoted civil defense deputy director Delfin Antonio Rodriguez as saying.

In its latest bulletin late on Tuesday, the country's Emergency Operation Center (COE) said 59 people were wounded in the explosion and 10 people were unaccounted for.

BUCHAREST, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine shipped 8.1 million tonnes of grain through the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta in the first seven months of the year, the port authority told Reuters, with the pace slowing in July when Russia began attacking infrastructure at its inland ports.

The Danube river is Ukraine's last waterborne route to export grain after access to its own Black Sea ports was cut off after Russia in mid-July left a safe passage grain corridor agreement brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Since then, Russia has attacked Danube ports repeatedly.

Constanta Port Authority data showed 8.1 million metric tonnes of Ukrainian grain left port in the first seven months, compared with 7.5 million tonnes by end-June.

Ukrainian grain competes for space in Constanta, which traditionally handles Romania's crop exports and those of its landlocked neighbours, including Hungary and Serbia.

Overall, it handled 18.9 million tonnes of grain in the first seven months of this year, the Constanta port authority told Reuters.

At its peak before the war in Ukraine, Constanta has handled 25 million tonnes in a year, but some port operators said the record will be topped as many have invested in boosting their capacity.

S&P sees Indian economy growing by average 6.7% to 2031 amid short-term challenges,"Employees work on their terminals inside the office of Manubhai & Shah LLP, a local accounting firm, in Ahmedabad, India, July 4, 2023. REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - (This Aug. 3 story has been corrected to say that India could overtake 'Japan and Germany' not 'Japan and China' in paragraph 6)

S&P Global on Thursday projected the Indian economy to grow by an average annual rate of 6.7% to March 2031, driven by manufacturing and services exports and consumer demand, despite short-term challenges from rate hikes and a global slowdown.

S&P retained its earlier forecast of 6% growth for the current fiscal year ending March 2024, noting even at this rate, India will be the fastest growing economy in the G20.

Last month, the International Monetary Fund raised its growth forecast for India by 0.2 percentage points to 6.1% for the current fiscal year, while the central bank has forecast 6.5% rise.

""While the world is in the midst of an unprecedented period of transition and uncertainty, India faces a defining opportunity to capitalize on this moment,"" said the S&P Global in its report ""Look Forward: India's Moment"" released in Delhi.

S&P Global expects the size of the economy to reach $6.7 trillion from $3.4 trillion in fiscal 2023, which could see per capita GDP rise to about $4,500.

If realised, India would overtake Japan and Germany to become the third largest economy in the world.

In manufacturing, new opportunities are expected to emerge from an accelerating global trend towards supply chain diversification, said the report, as the government offered incentives to manufacturers and improving infrastructure.

The economy is set to benefit from efficiency gains from tax reforms, state support to digital and physical infrastructure and reducing leakages from government subsidy transfers.

The Indian consumer market will more than double by 2031, surging to $5.2 trillion from $2.3 trillion in 2022, driven by rise in household incomes and higher spending on food and other items.

""Higher per capita incomes will also likely boost discretionary spending in areas such as entertainment, communications, restaurants and hotels,"" said the report.

S&P Global said developing a strong logistics framework will be key in transforming India from a services-dominated economy to a manufacturing-dominant one, besides increasing female participation in the workforce to realize a demographic dividend.

""India's ability to become a major global manufacturing hub will be a paramount test for its economic future.""

Russian attack damages grain silos at Ukraine's Danube port of Reni - Kyiv,"[1/4] A grain warehouse heavily damaged by a Russian drone attack is seen at a compound of a port on the Danube, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Odesa region, Ukraine August 16, 2023.

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Russian drone strikes damaged grain silos and warehouses at the Ukrainian river port of Reni on the Danube, a vital wartime route for Ukrainian food exports, senior officials said on Wednesday.

Russian strikes on port infrastructure on the Danube in recent weeks have piled pressure on Ukrainian food exports after Moscow quit a year-old deal that had allowed Kyiv to ship out grain via the Black Sea.

""Russian terrorists attacked Odesa region twice last night with attack drones,"" regional governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram. ""The main target is port and grain infrastructure in the south of the region.""

Photos released by the governor showed the destroyed metal walls of storage facilities and piles of scattered grain and sunflowers.

The strike targeted the port of Reni, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram. There were no casualties, he said.

An industry source told Reuters the port continued to operate after the attack.

Ukraine's Air Force said it had destroyed 13 Russian-launched drones over the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions in the south. It was not immediately clear how many drones Russia launched.

Ukraine's Danube ports accounted for around a quarter of grain exports before Russia pulled out of a U.N.-backed deal to provide safe passage for the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea in July

The ports have since become the main route out, with grain also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Russia attacked Izmail - Ukraine's main inland port across the Danube River from Romania, sending global food prices higher as it ramped up its use of force to prevent Ukraine from exporting grain. read more

The drone attacks destroyed buildings in the port and halted ships as they prepared to arrive there to load with Ukrainian grain in defiance of a de facto blockade Russia reimposed in mid-July.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on three entities it accused of being tied to arms deals between North Korea and Russia as Washington cracked down on those seeking to support Russia's war in Ukraine.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said that Russia has increasingly been forced to turn to North Korea and other allies to sustain its war in Ukraine as it expends munitions and loses heavy equipment on the battlefield.

The action is the latest by Washington, which has imposed rafts of sanctions targeting Moscow and Russian President Vladimir Putin since the start of the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and turned cities to rubble.

“The United States continues to root out illicit financial networks that seek to channel support from North Korea to Russia’s war machine,” Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said in the statement.

“Alongside our allies and partners, we remain committed to exposing and disrupting the arms trade underpinning Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine.""

Russia's embassy in Washington and North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The entities targeted in Wednesday's action are Limited Liability Company Verus, Defense Engineering Limited Liability Partnership and Versor S.R.O.

The Treasury said Slovakian national Ashot Mkrtychev, already under U.S. sanctions, is the president of Versor, founder and owner of Verus and director of Defense Engineering.

Washington accused Mkrtychev of negotiating with North Korean and Russian officials to organize potential plans to transfer over two dozens kinds of weapons and munitions to Russia in exchange for goods to North Korea.

Wednesday's action freezes any US assets of those designated and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with the sanctioned entities can also be hit with punitive measures.

Seaside screen brings magic of movies to Gaza years after cinemas closed,"GAZA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - With car tyres, rocks and mounds of sand as seats, Palestinians of all ages have been enjoying a rare trip to the movies at a big-screen event on the Gaza beachfront.

The open-air show - with a playlist including the animated children's comedy ""Ferdinand"" - was for many viewers a first experience of a projected film since the impoverished enclave's last cinema closed more than three decades ago.

Hosted by ""The Sea is Ours"" cafe, the screenings were designed to promote issues of culture and history approved by the conservative Islamist Hamas government.

They left some in the audience longing for more.

""I hope one day there will be a cinema, so I can go to the cinema and eat popcorn,"" said 13-year-old Mohammad Zidan as other children lolled in the sand, giggling at the cartoon.

Cinema once flourished in Gaza, with Palestinians flocking to see Arab, Western and Asian films, but the movie houses were torched in the First Intifada in 1987 and then burned down again in 1996 during a wave of internal violence.

The last cinema, long abandoned, is now a haven for bats.

While Gazans have been able to go to movie screenings which are held from time to time at theatres and other venues, such a full bill of films, being shown over several weeks at the venue, is a rare treat.

""We can get movies on mobile phones, but this is something new and is nice,"" said 15-year-old Hadeel Hejji.

Ali Mhana, 35, the cafe owner and local playwright, said he had never been to a regular cinema.

""At the sea, you don't need to look for an audience, the sea has its own. People are here all the time, including children, who get attracted by the sound and image and come to watch the movies,"" Mhana said.

Mexico's Sheinbaum grows lead for ruling party presidential ticket -poll,"Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum holds a rally at Macroplaza Iztapalapa, pursuing to be the ruling MORENA party's candidate for the 2024 presidential election, in Mexico City, Mexico, August 1, 2023.

MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has grown her lead to a 13-point advantage in the contest to be the ruling party's candidate in Mexico's 2024 presidential election, a poll published on Wednesday in newspaper El Universal showed.

With less than a month until the candidate is announced, the survey showed Sheinbaum with 35% support to be the nominee of the leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), followed by former Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard at 22%.

The survey of 1,000 adults by polling firm Buendia & Marquez also showed Sheinbaum was slightly more popular with respondents who identified with the opposition.

Both candidates have long been favorites for the MORENA ticket and ranked far ahead of the poll's next-best placed candidates, including former Interior Minister Adan Augusto Lopez, who had 7% support.

MORENA, lifted by the strong personal approval ratings of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is heavily favored to win the June 2024 election. That has prompted many analysts to view the MORENA contest as an almost de facto presidential race.

The poll showed that Ebrard was the best-known candidate, being recognized by 70% of respondents, while Sheinbaum followed closely at 69%.

Both resigned from their positions this year to compete in MORENA's internal contest, which formally kicked off on June 19. A winner is due to be announced on Sept. 6, and is expected to be based on voters' preferences.

The face-to-face voter survey was carried out from Aug. 10 to Aug. 14 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.53 percentage points, Buendia & Marquez said.

A survey published in June by Buendia & Marquez showed Sheinbaum polling with a 12-point lead with 34% support and Ebrard with 22% on the question of who should be MORENA's presidential candidate.

If Sheinbaum wins the nomination, Mexico could see women at the head of the presidential election's two top tickets.

Several polls have shown Senator Xochitl Galvez is well positioned to win the nomination for an alliance of leading opposition parties.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The death toll after Monday's explosion near the capital of the Dominican Republic has risen to 25, news agency AFP said in a report on Wednesday, citing local emergency services.

After the explosion at a business in San Cristobal, some 14 miles (23 km) from the capital Santo Domingo, the national health service had said that initial victims included a four-month-old baby.

According to the national health service the toll has risen to 25 including the bodies that have been recovered from the wreckage and people who later died in hospital, AFP quoted civil defense deputy director Delfin Antonio Rodriguez as saying.

In its latest bulletin late on Tuesday, the country's Emergency Operation Center (COE) said 59 people were wounded in the explosion and 10 people were unaccounted for.

Romanian Black Sea port shipped 8.1 mln tonnes of Ukrainian grain in January-July,"A view of the cereal terminal with grain silo in the Black Sea port of Constanta, Romania, May 11, 2022. REUTERS/Anca Cernat/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BUCHAREST, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine shipped 8.1 million tonnes of grain through the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta in the first seven months of the year, the port authority told Reuters, with the pace slowing in July when Russia began attacking infrastructure at its inland ports.

The Danube river is Ukraine's last waterborne route to export grain after access to its own Black Sea ports was cut off after Russia in mid-July left a safe passage grain corridor agreement brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Since then, Russia has attacked Danube ports repeatedly.

Constanta Port Authority data showed 8.1 million metric tonnes of Ukrainian grain left port in the first seven months, compared with 7.5 million tonnes by end-June.

Ukrainian grain competes for space in Constanta, which traditionally handles Romania's crop exports and those of its landlocked neighbours, including Hungary and Serbia.

Overall, it handled 18.9 million tonnes of grain in the first seven months of this year, the Constanta port authority told Reuters.

At its peak before the war in Ukraine, Constanta has handled 25 million tonnes in a year, but some port operators said the record will be topped as many have invested in boosting their capacity.

Ukraine's Danube ports accounted for around a quarter of grain exports before Russia withdrew from the U.N.-backed deal.

Its Danube ports have since become the main route out, with grain also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Romanian Transport Minister Sorin Grindeanu said European Union and NATO state Romania aimed to double the monthly transit capacity of Ukrainian grain to Constanta to 4 million tonnes in the coming months.

Various EU-funded connecting infrastructure projects were underway or pending in Romania, Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova, Grindeanu and representatives from the European Commission and the U.S. State Department said.

'Stop machine' - Russia releases video showing navy boarding cargo ship in Black Sea,"MOSCOW, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Russia on Tuesday released video footage showing an armed naval inspection unit boarding a cargo ship in the southwestern Black Sea on Sunday and questioning the captain about why the ship had not stopped when demanded to by a Russian warship.

Russia said that it fired warning shots with automatic weapons at the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan vessel after it failed to respond to a demand for it to halt, though it was unclear why the ship was boarded so close to Turkey.

In a video released by the Russian defence ministry, crew members can be seen kneeling on deck with their hands on their head as a Russian Ka-29 helicopter approaches.

What appears to be bodycam footage from the naval unit, shows Russian servicemen with automatic weapons checking the ship and entering the bridge.

""Stop machine, stop machine,"" one of the armed Russians says as crew members put their hands on their heads and kneel before the Russian weapons.

""Keep calm and listen to me,"" another Russian says.

""Good day sir. I am Russian naval officer - please don't shoot my group on video.""

Firing on a merchant vessel ratcheted up already acute concerns among shipowners, insurers and commodity traders about the dangers of getting ensnared in the Black Sea - the main route that both Ukraine and Russia use to get their agricultural produce to market.

Reuters could not reach the vessel or its owners for comment.

""During the inspection activities carried out, the work of the inspection team was carried out professionally in accordance with the requirements of international documents,"" the defence ministry said.

""After the completion of the work of the inspection team on board the Sukru Okan, a verification protocol was drawn up, the ship continued to move to the port of Izmail.""

The video shows the language barriers.

In one cut, a Russian demands: ""Speak English.""

""Yes, I am speaking English,"" one of the crew replies.

The Russian officer then questions the captain through a crew translator about why the ship did not stop when asked to.

The crew member translating for the captain indicates that the captain had not understood the Russian demand to stop.

""You, bad understand,"" the crew member says in English.

""Thank you, you good day sir,"" the Russian officer says as he leaves.

""Higher per capita incomes will also likely boost discretionary spending in areas such as entertainment, communications, restaurants and hotels,"" said the report.

S&P Global said developing a strong logistics framework will be key in transforming India from a services-dominated economy to a manufacturing-dominant one, besides increasing female participation in the workforce to realize a demographic dividend.

""India's ability to become a major global manufacturing hub will be a paramount test for its economic future.""

'Stop machine' - Russia releases video showing navy boarding cargo ship in Black Sea,"MOSCOW, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Russia on Tuesday released video footage showing an armed naval inspection unit boarding a cargo ship in the southwestern Black Sea on Sunday and questioning the captain about why the ship had not stopped when demanded to by a Russian warship.

Russia said that it fired warning shots with automatic weapons at the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan vessel after it failed to respond to a demand for it to halt, though it was unclear why the ship was boarded so close to Turkey.

In a video released by the Russian defence ministry, crew members can be seen kneeling on deck with their hands on their head as a Russian Ka-29 helicopter approaches.

What appears to be bodycam footage from the naval unit, shows Russian servicemen with automatic weapons checking the ship and entering the bridge.

""Stop machine, stop machine,"" one of the armed Russians says as crew members put their hands on their heads and kneel before the Russian weapons.

""Keep calm and listen to me,"" another Russian says.

""Good day sir. I am Russian naval officer - please don't shoot my group on video.""

Firing on a merchant vessel ratcheted up already acute concerns among shipowners, insurers and commodity traders about the dangers of getting ensnared in the Black Sea - the main route that both Ukraine and Russia use to get their agricultural produce to market.

Reuters could not reach the vessel or its owners for comment.

""During the inspection activities carried out, the work of the inspection team was carried out professionally in accordance with the requirements of international documents,"" the defence ministry said.

""After the completion of the work of the inspection team on board the Sukru Okan, a verification protocol was drawn up, the ship continued to move to the port of Izmail.""

The video shows the language barriers.

In one cut, a Russian demands: ""Speak English.""

""Yes, I am speaking English,"" one of the crew replies.

The Russian officer then questions the captain through a crew translator about why the ship did not stop when asked to.

The crew member translating for the captain indicates that the captain had not understood the Russian demand to stop.

""You, bad understand,"" the crew member says in English.

""Thank you, you good day sir,"" the Russian officer says as he leaves.

STOXX 600 down 0.1%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday on a drag from banks, as increasing evidence of China's economy rapidly losing steam kept investors on the edge, while UK stocks came under pressure from rising worries over sticky inflation.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) closed the day 0.1% lower, after falling as much as 0.4% and touching a new one-month low intraday.

The European banks index (.SX7P) lost 0.7%, touching a one-week low, with China-exposed HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) falling for the fifth session and shedding 1.7% to a more than two-month low.

Luxury giants LVMH (LVMH.PA) and Kering (PRTP.PA), exposed to Chinese consumer demand, also lost 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.

Missed payments on investment products by a leading Chinese trust firm and a fall in home prices added to worries that China's deepening property sector crisis is stifling what little momentum the economy has left.

""China sneezes the rest of the world gets a cold; any data points showing Chinese economy not running well is negative for global markets, particularly Europe, in terms of consumer demand from China,"" said Michael Field, European Equity Strategist at Morningstar.

Further, a flash estimate showed euro zone's second-quarter GDP rose by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, while another data set showed June industrial production increased by 0.5% month-on-month.

The STOXX 600, weighed down by signs of slowing growth in China, has underperformed its U.S. peers this year, with its 7.2% gain well below the 15.3% jump in the S&P 500 index (.SPX).

Meanwhile, UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 (.FTSE) fell 0.4% on growing worries about persistently high British inflation as key measures of price growth monitored by the Bank of England failed to ease in July, despite a sharp drop in headline inflation.

""While it's good to celebrate inflation coming down to this point, we have to recognise that from here the bulk of core inflation is far more difficult to get down,"" Morningstar's Field added.

Among major individual movers, British motor and home insurer Admiral Group (ADML.L) jumped 7.2% to top the STOXX 600 following a marginal rise in first-half pre-tax profit.

Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) slumped 10.6% to the bottom of STOXX 600, after its CEO said the infrastructure firm is facing challenges in its U.S. office projects.

German life-science company Bayer (BAYGn.DE) lost 1.7% following a Berenberg rating downgrade to ""hold"" from ""buy"".

Second-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to decrease 4.6% from a year earlier, slightly less than the 4.8%-drop estimated last week, Refinitiv data showed.

Seaside screen brings magic of movies to Gaza years after cinemas closed,"GAZA, Aug 16 (Reuters) - With car tyres, rocks and mounds of sand as seats, Palestinians of all ages have been enjoying a rare trip to the movies at a big-screen event on the Gaza beachfront.

The open-air show - with a playlist including the animated children's comedy ""Ferdinand"" - was for many viewers a first experience of a projected film since the impoverished enclave's last cinema closed more than three decades ago.

Hosted by ""The Sea is Ours"" cafe, the screenings were designed to promote issues of culture and history approved by the conservative Islamist Hamas government.

They left some in the audience longing for more.

""I hope one day there will be a cinema, so I can go to the cinema and eat popcorn,"" said 13-year-old Mohammad Zidan as other children lolled in the sand, giggling at the cartoon.

Cinema once flourished in Gaza, with Palestinians flocking to see Arab, Western and Asian films, but the movie houses were torched in the First Intifada in 1987 and then burned down again in 1996 during a wave of internal violence.

The last cinema, long abandoned, is now a haven for bats.

While Gazans have been able to go to movie screenings which are held from time to time at theatres and other venues, such a full bill of films, being shown over several weeks at the venue, is a rare treat.

""We can get movies on mobile phones, but this is something new and is nice,"" said 15-year-old Hadeel Hejji.

Ali Mhana, 35, the cafe owner and local playwright, said he had never been to a regular cinema.

""At the sea, you don't need to look for an audience, the sea has its own. People are here all the time, including children, who get attracted by the sound and image and come to watch the movies,"" Mhana said.

Mexico's Sheinbaum grows lead for ruling party presidential ticket -poll,"Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum holds a rally at Macroplaza Iztapalapa, pursuing to be the ruling MORENA party's candidate for the 2024 presidential election, in Mexico City, Mexico, August 1, 2023. REUTERS/Henry Romero/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

MEXICO CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has grown her lead to a 13-point advantage in the contest to be the ruling party's candidate in Mexico's 2024 presidential election, a poll published on Wednesday in newspaper El Universal showed.

With less than a month until the candidate is announced, the survey showed Sheinbaum with 35% support to be the nominee of the leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), followed by former Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard at 22%.

The survey of 1,000 adults by polling firm Buendia & Marquez also showed Sheinbaum was slightly more popular with respondents who identified with the opposition.

Both candidates have long been favorites for the MORENA ticket and ranked far ahead of the poll's next-best placed candidates, including former Interior Minister Adan Augusto Lopez, who had 7% support.

MORENA, lifted by the strong personal approval ratings of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, is heavily favored to win the June 2024 election. That has prompted many analysts to view the MORENA contest as an almost de facto presidential race.

The poll showed that Ebrard was the best-known candidate, being recognized by 70% of respondents, while Sheinbaum followed closely at 69%.

Both resigned from their positions this year to compete in MORENA's internal contest, which formally kicked off on June 19. A winner is due to be announced on Sept. 6, and is expected to be based on voters' preferences.

The face-to-face voter survey was carried out from Aug. 10 to Aug. 14 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.53 percentage points, Buendia & Marquez said.

A survey published in June by Buendia & Marquez showed Sheinbaum polling with a 12-point lead with 34% support and Ebrard with 22% on the question of who should be MORENA's presidential candidate.

If Sheinbaum wins the nomination, Mexico could see women at the head of the presidential election's two top tickets.

Several polls have shown Senator Xochitl Galvez is well positioned to win the nomination for an alliance of leading opposition parties.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The death toll after Monday's explosion near the capital of the Dominican Republic has risen to 25, news agency AFP said in a report on Wednesday, citing local emergency services.

After the explosion at a business in San Cristobal, some 14 miles (23 km) from the capital Santo Domingo, the national health service had said that initial victims included a four-month-old baby.

According to the national health service the toll has risen to 25 including the bodies that have been recovered from the wreckage and people who later died in hospital, AFP quoted civil defense deputy director Delfin Antonio Rodriguez as saying.

In its latest bulletin late on Tuesday, the country's Emergency Operation Center (COE) said 59 people were wounded in the explosion and 10 people were unaccounted for.

Romanian Black Sea port shipped 8.1 mln tonnes of Ukrainian grain in January-July,"A view of the cereal terminal with grain silo in the Black Sea port of Constanta, Romania, May 11, 2022. REUTERS/Anca Cernat/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BUCHAREST, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine shipped 8.1 million tonnes of grain through the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta in the first seven months of the year, the port authority told Reuters, with the pace slowing in July when Russia began attacking infrastructure at its inland ports.

The Danube river is Ukraine's last waterborne route to export grain after access to its own Black Sea ports was cut off after Russia in mid-July left a safe passage grain corridor agreement brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Since then, Russia has attacked Danube ports repeatedly.

Constanta Port Authority data showed 8.1 million metric tonnes of Ukrainian grain left port in the first seven months, compared with 7.5 million tonnes by end-June.

Ukrainian grain competes for space in Constanta, which traditionally handles Romania's crop exports and those of its landlocked neighbours, including Hungary and Serbia.

Overall, it handled 18.9 million tonnes of grain in the first seven months of this year, the Constanta port authority told Reuters.

At its peak before the war in Ukraine, Constanta has handled 25 million tonnes in a year, but some port operators said the record will be topped as many have invested in boosting their capacity.

Ukraine's Danube ports accounted for around a quarter of grain exports before Russia withdrew from the U.N.-backed deal.

Its Danube ports have since become the main route out, with grain also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Romanian Transport Minister Sorin Grindeanu said European Union and NATO state Romania aimed to double the monthly transit capacity of Ukrainian grain to Constanta to 4 million tonnes in the coming months.

Various EU-funded connecting infrastructure projects were underway or pending in Romania, Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova, Grindeanu and representatives from the European Commission and the U.S. State Department said.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Embattled property developer China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) on Wednesday resolved to delay its meetings for the Hong Kong CEG class A and class C holders of debt to provide them more time to consider its fresh restructuring plan.

The company adjourned its meetings for the creditors to Aug. 28. The meeting will consider the $3.2 billion restructuring plan that was unveiled on Monday to reduce debt and stay afloat.

The deadline for the submission (or resubmission) of the relevant forms to vote on the schemes and attend the adjourned meetings has been extended to 5:00 p.m. (Hong Kong time) on Aug. 23.

Trading in the company's shares, which were suspended on March 21 last year, will remain suspended until further notice, the company said.

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - (This Aug. 3 story has been corrected to say that India could overtake 'Japan and Germany' not 'Japan and China' in paragraph 6)

S&P Global on Thursday projected the Indian economy to grow by an average annual rate of 6.7% to March 2031, driven by manufacturing and services exports and consumer demand, despite short-term challenges from rate hikes and a global slowdown.

S&P retained its earlier forecast of 6% growth for the current fiscal year ending March 2024, noting even at this rate, India will be the fastest growing economy in the G20.

Last month, the International Monetary Fund raised its growth forecast for India by 0.2 percentage points to 6.1% for the current fiscal year, while the central bank has forecast 6.5% rise.

""While the world is in the midst of an unprecedented period of transition and uncertainty, India faces a defining opportunity to capitalize on this moment,"" said the S&P Global in its report ""Look Forward: India's Moment"" released in Delhi.

S&P Global expects the size of the economy to reach $6.7 trillion from $3.4 trillion in fiscal 2023, which could see per capita GDP rise to about $4,500.

If realised, India would overtake Japan and Germany to become the third largest economy in the world.

In manufacturing, new opportunities are expected to emerge from an accelerating global trend towards supply chain diversification, said the report, as the government offered incentives to manufacturers and improving infrastructure.

The economy is set to benefit from efficiency gains from tax reforms, state support to digital and physical infrastructure and reducing leakages from government subsidy transfers.

The Indian consumer market will more than double by 2031, surging to $5.2 trillion from $2.3 trillion in 2022, driven by rise in household incomes and higher spending on food and other items.

Libya clashes toll hits 55 dead - medical agency,"[1/2] Members of the Security personnel affiliated with the Ministry of Interior secure the streets after yesterday's clashes between armed factions in Tripoli, Libya, August 16, 2023 REUTERS/Hazem Ahmed Acquire Licensing Rights

TRIPOLI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The casualty toll from clashes in Libya's capital Tripoli over Monday and Tuesday was 55 killed and 146 wounded, the emergency services said.

City elders announced late on Tuesday that they had brokered a deal to end Tripoli's deadliest violence in years with the Special Deterrence Force handing 444 Brigade commander Mahmoud Hamza over to a third faction, the Stability Support Apparatus.

Hamza had been seized by the Special Deterrence Force, which controls Mitiga airport, as he attempted to travel on Monday.

Airlines that on Tuesday stopped using Mitiga airport, where some of the worst fighting took place, resumed flights on Wednesday, they said.

As part of the deal announced by the elders, police and other security forces that stayed neutral in the clashes moved into areas where the fighting took place.

However, the dispute remains unresolved and a source in 444 Brigade said it might resume military operations if Hamza was not returned to his own base.

Major warfare in Libya has been paused since a 2020 truce between the main eastern and western sides, but rival factions still hold most territory and a lasting solution to the conflict that has raged since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising looks distant.

S&P Global expects the size of the economy to reach $6.7 trillion from $3.4 trillion in fiscal 2023, which could see per capita GDP rise to about $4,500.

If realised, India would overtake Japan and Germany to become the third largest economy in the world.

In manufacturing, new opportunities are expected to emerge from an accelerating global trend towards supply chain diversification, said the report, as the government offered incentives to manufacturers and improving infrastructure.

The economy is set to benefit from efficiency gains from tax reforms, state support to digital and physical infrastructure and reducing leakages from government subsidy transfers.

The Indian consumer market will more than double by 2031, surging to $5.2 trillion from $2.3 trillion in 2022, driven by rise in household incomes and higher spending on food and other items.

""Higher per capita incomes will also likely boost discretionary spending in areas such as entertainment, communications, restaurants and hotels,"" said the report.

S&P Global said developing a strong logistics framework will be key in transforming India from a services-dominated economy to a manufacturing-dominant one, besides increasing female participation in the workforce to realize a demographic dividend.

""India's ability to become a major global manufacturing hub will be a paramount test for its economic future.""

'Stop machine' - Russia releases video showing navy boarding cargo ship in Black Sea,"MOSCOW, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Russia on Tuesday released video footage showing an armed naval inspection unit boarding a cargo ship in the southwestern Black Sea on Sunday and questioning the captain about why the ship had not stopped when demanded to by a Russian warship.

Russia said that it fired warning shots with automatic weapons at the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan vessel after it failed to respond to a demand for it to halt, though it was unclear why the ship was boarded so close to Turkey.

In a video released by the Russian defence ministry, crew members can be seen kneeling on deck with their hands on their head as a Russian Ka-29 helicopter approaches.

What appears to be bodycam footage from the naval unit, shows Russian servicemen with automatic weapons checking the ship and entering the bridge.

""Stop machine, stop machine,"" one of the armed Russians says as crew members put their hands on their heads and kneel before the Russian weapons.

""Keep calm and listen to me,"" another Russian says.

""Good day sir. I am Russian naval officer - please don't shoot my group on video.""

Firing on a merchant vessel ratcheted up already acute concerns among shipowners, insurers and commodity traders about the dangers of getting ensnared in the Black Sea - the main route that both Ukraine and Russia use to get their agricultural produce to market.

Reuters could not reach the vessel or its owners for comment.

""During the inspection activities carried out, the work of the inspection team was carried out professionally in accordance with the requirements of international documents,"" the defence ministry said.

""After the completion of the work of the inspection team on board the Sukru Okan, a verification protocol was drawn up, the ship continued to move to the port of Izmail.""

The video shows the language barriers.

In one cut, a Russian demands: ""Speak English.""

""Yes, I am speaking English,"" one of the crew replies.

The Russian officer then questions the captain through a crew translator about why the ship did not stop when asked to.

The crew member translating for the captain indicates that the captain had not understood the Russian demand to stop.

""You, bad understand,"" the crew member says in English.

""Thank you, you good day sir,"" the Russian officer says as he leaves.

STOXX 600 down 0.1%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday on a drag from banks, as increasing evidence of China's economy rapidly losing steam kept investors on the edge, while UK stocks came under pressure from rising worries over sticky inflation.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) closed the day 0.1% lower, after falling as much as 0.4% and touching a new one-month low intraday.

The European banks index (.SX7P) lost 0.7%, touching a one-week low, with China-exposed HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) falling for the fifth session and shedding 1.7% to a more than two-month low.

Luxury giants LVMH (LVMH.PA) and Kering (PRTP.PA), exposed to Chinese consumer demand, also lost 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.

Missed payments on investment products by a leading Chinese trust firm and a fall in home prices added to worries that China's deepening property sector crisis is stifling what little momentum the economy has left.

""China sneezes the rest of the world gets a cold; any data points showing Chinese economy not running well is negative for global markets, particularly Europe, in terms of consumer demand from China,"" said Michael Field, European Equity Strategist at Morningstar.

Further, a flash estimate showed euro zone's second-quarter GDP rose by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, while another data set showed June industrial production increased by 0.5% month-on-month.

The STOXX 600, weighed down by signs of slowing growth in China, has underperformed its U.S. peers this year, with its 7.2% gain well below the 15.3% jump in the S&P 500 index (.SPX).

Meanwhile, UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 (.FTSE) fell 0.4% on growing worries about persistently high British inflation as key measures of price growth monitored by the Bank of England failed to ease in July, despite a sharp drop in headline inflation.

""While it's good to celebrate inflation coming down to this point, we have to recognise that from here the bulk of core inflation is far more difficult to get down,"" Morningstar's Field added.

Among major individual movers, British motor and home insurer Admiral Group (ADML.L) jumped 7.2% to top the STOXX 600 following a marginal rise in first-half pre-tax profit.

Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) slumped 10.6% to the bottom of STOXX 600, after its CEO said the infrastructure firm is facing challenges in its U.S. office projects.

German life-science company Bayer (BAYGn.DE) lost 1.7% following a Berenberg rating downgrade to ""hold"" from ""buy"".

Second-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to decrease 4.6% from a year earlier, slightly less than the 4.8%-drop estimated last week, Refinitiv data showed.

Libya clashes toll hits 55 dead - medical agency,"[1/2] Members of the Security personnel affiliated with the Ministry of Interior secure the streets after yesterday's clashes between armed factions in Tripoli, Libya, August 16, 2023 REUTERS/Hazem Ahmed Acquire Licensing Rights

TRIPOLI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The casualty toll from clashes in Libya's capital Tripoli over Monday and Tuesday was 55 killed and 146 wounded, the emergency services said.

City elders announced late on Tuesday that they had brokered a deal to end Tripoli's deadliest violence in years with the Special Deterrence Force handing 444 Brigade commander Mahmoud Hamza over to a third faction, the Stability Support Apparatus.

Hamza had been seized by the Special Deterrence Force, which controls Mitiga airport, as he attempted to travel on Monday.

Airlines that on Tuesday stopped using Mitiga airport, where some of the worst fighting took place, resumed flights on Wednesday, they said.

As part of the deal announced by the elders, police and other security forces that stayed neutral in the clashes moved into areas where the fighting took place.

However, the dispute remains unresolved and a source in 444 Brigade said it might resume military operations if Hamza was not returned to his own base.

Major warfare in Libya has been paused since a 2020 truce between the main eastern and western sides, but rival factions still hold most territory and a lasting solution to the conflict that has raged since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising looks distant.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The death toll after Monday's explosion near the capital of the Dominican Republic has risen to 25, news agency AFP said in a report on Wednesday, citing local emergency services.

After the explosion at a business in San Cristobal, some 14 miles (23 km) from the capital Santo Domingo, the national health service had said that initial victims included a four-month-old baby.

According to the national health service the toll has risen to 25 including the bodies that have been recovered from the wreckage and people who later died in hospital, AFP quoted civil defense deputy director Delfin Antonio Rodriguez as saying.

In its latest bulletin late on Tuesday, the country's Emergency Operation Center (COE) said 59 people were wounded in the explosion and 10 people were unaccounted for.

Romanian Black Sea port shipped 8.1 mln tonnes of Ukrainian grain in January-July,"A view of the cereal terminal with grain silo in the Black Sea port of Constanta, Romania, May 11, 2022. REUTERS/Anca Cernat/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BUCHAREST, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine shipped 8.1 million tonnes of grain through the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta in the first seven months of the year, the port authority told Reuters, with the pace slowing in July when Russia began attacking infrastructure at its inland ports.

The Danube river is Ukraine's last waterborne route to export grain after access to its own Black Sea ports was cut off after Russia in mid-July left a safe passage grain corridor agreement brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Since then, Russia has attacked Danube ports repeatedly.

Constanta Port Authority data showed 8.1 million metric tonnes of Ukrainian grain left port in the first seven months, compared with 7.5 million tonnes by end-June.

Ukrainian grain competes for space in Constanta, which traditionally handles Romania's crop exports and those of its landlocked neighbours, including Hungary and Serbia.

Overall, it handled 18.9 million tonnes of grain in the first seven months of this year, the Constanta port authority told Reuters.

At its peak before the war in Ukraine, Constanta has handled 25 million tonnes in a year, but some port operators said the record will be topped as many have invested in boosting their capacity.

Ukraine's Danube ports accounted for around a quarter of grain exports before Russia withdrew from the U.N.-backed deal.

Its Danube ports have since become the main route out, with grain also sent on barges to Romania's Black Sea port of Constanta for shipment onwards.

Earlier this month, Romanian Transport Minister Sorin Grindeanu said European Union and NATO state Romania aimed to double the monthly transit capacity of Ukrainian grain to Constanta to 4 million tonnes in the coming months.

Various EU-funded connecting infrastructure projects were underway or pending in Romania, Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova, Grindeanu and representatives from the European Commission and the U.S. State Department said.

S&P Global on Thursday projected the Indian economy to grow by an average annual rate of 6.7% to March 2031, driven by manufacturing and services exports and consumer demand, despite short-term challenges from rate hikes and a global slowdown.

"China military action to US stopover would be election interference, Taiwan VP says","Taiwan's Vice President William Lai speaks during a welcome dinner in Asuncion, Paraguay, in this handout picture released on August 15, 2023. Taiwan Presidential Office/Handout via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights

TAIPEI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Any Chinese military action in response to stopovers in the U.S. by Taiwan Vice President William Lai would be an attempt by China to interfere in the island's elections, Lai said during a trip to Paraguay.

Taiwanese officials say China could launch military drills this week, using Lai's stopovers in the United States as a pretext to intimidate voters ahead of an election next year and make them ""fear war"".

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has a particular dislike of Lai who has in the past described himself as a ""practical worker for Taiwan independence"". He is the front-runner to become the next president in January's election.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Paraguay, where he arrived via New York, Lai said such U.S. transits were routine and China had no cause to use them as an excuse to ""verbally and militarily intimidate Taiwan"", the island's official Central News Agency reported.

""If China uses the transits as an excuse to again launch verbal and military intimidation or other threatening methods, it just confirms international media reports that China is attempting to intervene in Taiwan's election with military threats,"" the news agency cited Lai as saying.

Lai, however, said he had confidence in Taiwan's people.

Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday it had yet to see any large-scale Chinese manoeuvres near the island.

In April, China held war games around Taiwan after President Tsai Ing-wen returned from California where she met U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on her way back from Central America.

China has denounced Lai's New York stop - he is due in San Francisco on Wednesday on his way back to Taipei - and said he is a separatist ""troublemaker"".

Both Taiwan and the United States have sought to keep Lai's U.S. stopovers low key, and Lai said there were ""no special arrangements"" to meet with U.S. officials.

China considers Taiwan to be its most sensitive and important political and diplomatic issue, and it is a constant source of Sino-U.S. friction.

Speaking at a conference in Moscow on Tuesday, Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu said ""playing with fire on the Taiwan issue and vainly trying to 'control China with Taiwan' is bound to end in failure"".

Lai has been in Paraguay for the inauguration of its new president. It is one of only 13 countries to maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Lai posted on his Facebook pages pictures of him in Asuncion shaking hands with and chatting to U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, as well as Spain's King Felipe VI and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who were there for the same event.

China says Taiwan has no right to state-to-state ties and has been trying to pick off Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies. Honduras, once a stalwart friend of Taipei's, switched ties to Beijing in March.

What appears to be bodycam footage from the naval unit, shows Russian servicemen with automatic weapons checking the ship and entering the bridge.

""Stop machine, stop machine,"" one of the armed Russians says as crew members put their hands on their heads and kneel before the Russian weapons.

""Keep calm and listen to me,"" another Russian says.

""Good day sir. I am Russian naval officer - please don't shoot my group on video.""

Firing on a merchant vessel ratcheted up already acute concerns among shipowners, insurers and commodity traders about the dangers of getting ensnared in the Black Sea - the main route that both Ukraine and Russia use to get their agricultural produce to market.

Reuters could not reach the vessel or its owners for comment.

""During the inspection activities carried out, the work of the inspection team was carried out professionally in accordance with the requirements of international documents,"" the defence ministry said.

""After the completion of the work of the inspection team on board the Sukru Okan, a verification protocol was drawn up, the ship continued to move to the port of Izmail.""

The video shows the language barriers.

In one cut, a Russian demands: ""Speak English.""

""Yes, I am speaking English,"" one of the crew replies.

The Russian officer then questions the captain through a crew translator about why the ship did not stop when asked to.

The crew member translating for the captain indicates that the captain had not understood the Russian demand to stop.

""You, bad understand,"" the crew member says in English.

""Thank you, you good day sir,"" the Russian officer says as he leaves.

Admiral tops STOXX 600 after results

STOXX 600 down 0.1%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday on a drag from banks, as increasing evidence of China's economy rapidly losing steam kept investors on the edge, while UK stocks came under pressure from rising worries over sticky inflation.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) closed the day 0.1% lower, after falling as much as 0.4% and touching a new one-month low intraday.

The European banks index (.SX7P) lost 0.7%, touching a one-week low, with China-exposed HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) falling for the fifth session and shedding 1.7% to a more than two-month low.

Luxury giants LVMH (LVMH.PA) and Kering (PRTP.PA), exposed to Chinese consumer demand, also lost 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.

Missed payments on investment products by a leading Chinese trust firm and a fall in home prices added to worries that China's deepening property sector crisis is stifling what little momentum the economy has left.

""China sneezes the rest of the world gets a cold; any data points showing Chinese economy not running well is negative for global markets, particularly Europe, in terms of consumer demand from China,"" said Michael Field, European Equity Strategist at Morningstar.

Further, a flash estimate showed euro zone's second-quarter GDP rose by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, while another data set showed June industrial production increased by 0.5% month-on-month.

The STOXX 600, weighed down by signs of slowing growth in China, has underperformed its U.S. peers this year, with its 7.2% gain well below the 15.3% jump in the S&P 500 index (.SPX).

Meanwhile, UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 (.FTSE) fell 0.4% on growing worries about persistently high British inflation as key measures of price growth monitored by the Bank of England failed to ease in July, despite a sharp drop in headline inflation.

""While it's good to celebrate inflation coming down to this point, we have to recognise that from here the bulk of core inflation is far more difficult to get down,"" Morningstar's Field added.

Among major individual movers, British motor and home insurer Admiral Group (ADML.L) jumped 7.2% to top the STOXX 600 following a marginal rise in first-half pre-tax profit.

Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) slumped 10.6% to the bottom of STOXX 600, after its CEO said the infrastructure firm is facing challenges in its U.S. office projects.

German life-science company Bayer (BAYGn.DE) lost 1.7% following a Berenberg rating downgrade to ""hold"" from ""buy"".

Second-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to decrease 4.6% from a year earlier, slightly less than the 4.8%-drop estimated last week, Refinitiv data showed.

Libya clashes toll hits 55 dead - medical agency,"[1/2] Members of the Security personnel affiliated with the Ministry of Interior secure the streets after yesterday's clashes between armed factions in Tripoli, Libya, August 16, 2023 REUTERS/Hazem Ahmed Acquire Licensing Rights

TRIPOLI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The casualty toll from clashes in Libya's capital Tripoli over Monday and Tuesday was 55 killed and 146 wounded, the emergency services said.

City elders announced late on Tuesday that they had brokered a deal to end Tripoli's deadliest violence in years with the Special Deterrence Force handing 444 Brigade commander Mahmoud Hamza over to a third faction, the Stability Support Apparatus.

Hamza had been seized by the Special Deterrence Force, which controls Mitiga airport, as he attempted to travel on Monday.

Airlines that on Tuesday stopped using Mitiga airport, where some of the worst fighting took place, resumed flights on Wednesday, they said.

As part of the deal announced by the elders, police and other security forces that stayed neutral in the clashes moved into areas where the fighting took place.

However, the dispute remains unresolved and a source in 444 Brigade said it might resume military operations if Hamza was not returned to his own base.

Major warfare in Libya has been paused since a 2020 truce between the main eastern and western sides, but rival factions still hold most territory and a lasting solution to the conflict that has raged since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising looks distant.

"China military action to US stopover would be election interference, Taiwan VP says","Taiwan's Vice President William Lai speaks during a welcome dinner in Asuncion, Paraguay, in this handout picture released on August 15, 2023. Taiwan Presidential Office/Handout via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights

TAIPEI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Any Chinese military action in response to stopovers in the U.S. by Taiwan Vice President William Lai would be an attempt by China to interfere in the island's elections, Lai said during a trip to Paraguay.

Taiwanese officials say China could launch military drills this week, using Lai's stopovers in the United States as a pretext to intimidate voters ahead of an election next year and make them ""fear war"".

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has a particular dislike of Lai who has in the past described himself as a ""practical worker for Taiwan independence"". He is the front-runner to become the next president in January's election.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Paraguay, where he arrived via New York, Lai said such U.S. transits were routine and China had no cause to use them as an excuse to ""verbally and militarily intimidate Taiwan"", the island's official Central News Agency reported.

""If China uses the transits as an excuse to again launch verbal and military intimidation or other threatening methods, it just confirms international media reports that China is attempting to intervene in Taiwan's election with military threats,"" the news agency cited Lai as saying.

Lai, however, said he had confidence in Taiwan's people.

Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday it had yet to see any large-scale Chinese manoeuvres near the island.

In April, China held war games around Taiwan after President Tsai Ing-wen returned from California where she met U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on her way back from Central America.

China has denounced Lai's New York stop - he is due in San Francisco on Wednesday on his way back to Taipei - and said he is a separatist ""troublemaker"".

Both Taiwan and the United States have sought to keep Lai's U.S. stopovers low key, and Lai said there were ""no special arrangements"" to meet with U.S. officials.

China considers Taiwan to be its most sensitive and important political and diplomatic issue, and it is a constant source of Sino-U.S. friction.

Speaking at a conference in Moscow on Tuesday, Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu said ""playing with fire on the Taiwan issue and vainly trying to 'control China with Taiwan' is bound to end in failure"".

Lai has been in Paraguay for the inauguration of its new president. It is one of only 13 countries to maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Lai posted on his Facebook pages pictures of him in Asuncion shaking hands with and chatting to U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, as well as Spain's King Felipe VI and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who were there for the same event.

China says Taiwan has no right to state-to-state ties and has been trying to pick off Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies. Honduras, once a stalwart friend of Taipei's, switched ties to Beijing in March.

Maui wildfire shutters treasured Hawaiian language school,"A view of burned debris after wildfires devastated the historic town of Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, U.S., August 10, 2023. Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Punana Leo language-immersion school in Lahaina, the historic former capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, stood for decades as a gleaming symbol of the fight to stop Hawaiian language and culture from disappearing forever.

Last week the preschool became one of the casualties of a wildfire inferno that displaced thousands, upended Maui's tourism-fueled economy and killed more than 100 people - a number that is expected to rise as the search for the missing pushes ahead.

The school was decimated, said Ka'iulani Laeha, chief executive officer of Aha Punana Leo, the nonprofit organization that ran the Lahaina school. It burned down alongside historic Waiola Church, a 200-year-old building that once served as the burial place for some of Hawaii's royal family.

""This is a huge devastation to that community as a whole,"" Laeha said, adding that a majority of the dozens of students and faculty at Punana Leo also lost their homes last week when the fire raced through the West Maui town, leaving a trail of ashes in its wake. Thankfully, she said, everyone had been found safe or accounted for.

The Lahaina Punana Leo was one of Aha Punana Leo's 13 schools across Hawaii dedicated to immersing young people in Olelo Hawaii, the ancestral language of the archipelago, which came close to extinction before an organized campaign to save it began in the 1970s. Punana Leo is Hawaiian for ""nest of voices.""

The loss of the school is especially painful because of its location in Lahaina, a focal point of Hawaii's Polynesian culture. It was one of the first centers established under a movement to revive the language after a government ban on teaching Hawaiian was lifted in 1978.

Punana Leo schools predate the Hawaii Department of Education's own language immersion program established a few years later in the late 1980s. The department oversees around two dozen public schools offering Hawaiian immersion.

When foreign settlers first arrived to the Hawaiian Islands in the 1800s, around 400,000 to 800,000 people spoke Olelo Hawaii. By the 1980s, only a few hundred native speakers were left.

Today, there are only an estimated 26,000 Hawaiian language speakers even with some 309,000 people identifying as at least partially Hawaiian, according to the 2021 U.S. census.

Kaliko Baker, an associate professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said the fire destroyed more than just a building. The school was symbolic of the health of a culture that has survived years of struggle, he said.

""Language to a people is a cornerstone,"" Baker said, ""upon which a foundation is set to build the character of the national ethnic identity.""

Learning a language is key to the identity of a people, he said. ""We learn who we were, which informs who we are today, and who we'd like to be in the future.""

Despite efforts by Aha Punana Leo and the education department, the Hawaiian language remains on UNESCO's endangered language list, highlighting the continued need for schools such as Punana Leo in Lahaina.

All three of the state-run immersion schools located in Lahaina remain closed following the fire, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.

Lahaina schools had a total enrollment of about 3,000 students, with hundreds of faculty and staff.

In a statement Tuesday, Superintendent Keith Hayashi said the schools only suffered minor damages.

But the top priority from both the Department of Education and Aha Punana Leo remains the immediate safety of students and residents.

""We have every intention to rebuild in the long term,"" Laeha said. ""But for right now, our priority is making sure that everyone is supported in the ways that they need.""

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Embattled property developer China Evergrande Group (3333.HK) on Wednesday resolved to delay its meetings for the Hong Kong CEG class A and class C holders of debt to provide them more time to consider its fresh restructuring plan.

The company adjourned its meetings for the creditors to Aug. 28. The meeting will consider the $3.2 billion restructuring plan that was unveiled on Monday to reduce debt and stay afloat.

The deadline for the submission (or resubmission) of the relevant forms to vote on the schemes and attend the adjourned meetings has been extended to 5:00 p.m. (Hong Kong time) on Aug. 23.

Trading in the company's shares, which were suspended on March 21 last year, will remain suspended until further notice, the company said.

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - (This Aug. 3 story has been corrected to say that India could overtake 'Japan and Germany' not 'Japan and China' in paragraph 6)

S&P Global on Thursday projected the Indian economy to grow by an average annual rate of 6.7% to March 2031, driven by manufacturing and services exports and consumer demand, despite short-term challenges from rate hikes and a global slowdown.

S&P retained its earlier forecast of 6% growth for the current fiscal year ending March 2024, noting even at this rate, India will be the fastest growing economy in the G20.

Last month, the International Monetary Fund raised its growth forecast for India by 0.2 percentage points to 6.1% for the current fiscal year, while the central bank has forecast 6.5% rise.

""While the world is in the midst of an unprecedented period of transition and uncertainty, India faces a defining opportunity to capitalize on this moment,"" said the S&P Global in its report ""Look Forward: India's Moment"" released in Delhi.

S&P Global expects the size of the economy to reach $6.7 trillion from $3.4 trillion in fiscal 2023, which could see per capita GDP rise to about $4,500.

If realised, India would overtake Japan and Germany to become the third largest economy in the world.

In manufacturing, new opportunities are expected to emerge from an accelerating global trend towards supply chain diversification, said the report, as the government offered incentives to manufacturers and improving infrastructure.

The economy is set to benefit from efficiency gains from tax reforms, state support to digital and physical infrastructure and reducing leakages from government subsidy transfers.

The Indian consumer market will more than double by 2031, surging to $5.2 trillion from $2.3 trillion in 2022, driven by rise in household incomes and higher spending on food and other items.

""Higher per capita incomes will also likely boost discretionary spending in areas such as entertainment, communications, restaurants and hotels,"" said the report.

S&P Global said developing a strong logistics framework will be key in transforming India from a services-dominated economy to a manufacturing-dominant one, besides increasing female participation in the workforce to realize a demographic dividend.

""India's ability to become a major global manufacturing hub will be a paramount test for its economic future.""

'Stop machine' - Russia releases video showing navy boarding cargo ship in Black Sea,"MOSCOW, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Russia on Tuesday released video footage showing an armed naval inspection unit boarding a cargo ship in the southwestern Black Sea on Sunday and questioning the captain about why the ship had not stopped when demanded to by a Russian warship.

Last month, the government sold a more-than-5% stake in another state-run railways company, Rail Vikas Nigam, raising 13.66 billion rupees ($164.34 million).

So far in fiscal 2024, it has raised 56 billion rupees against a target of 510 billion rupees.

The Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The sale would also have the added advantage of the government adhering to the regulator-mandated minimum public shareholding norms, which requires that public companies maintain at least 25% public shareholding.

While state-run firms have greater leeway in this regard, the government intends to bring down its shareholding in line with the norms.

Shares of IRFC have gained 58% over the last four weeks. The stock was trading at 51.55 rupees per share at 01.42 p.m. IST on Wednesday, up 1%.

S&P sees Indian economy growing by average 6.7% to 2031 amid short-term challenges,"Employees work on their terminals inside the office of Manubhai & Shah LLP, a local accounting firm, in Ahmedabad, India, July 4, 2023. REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - (This Aug. 3 story has been corrected to say that India could overtake 'Japan and Germany' not 'Japan and China' in paragraph 6)

S&P Global on Thursday projected the Indian economy to grow by an average annual rate of 6.7% to March 2031, driven by manufacturing and services exports and consumer demand, despite short-term challenges from rate hikes and a global slowdown.

S&P retained its earlier forecast of 6% growth for the current fiscal year ending March 2024, noting even at this rate, India will be the fastest growing economy in the G20.

Last month, the International Monetary Fund raised its growth forecast for India by 0.2 percentage points to 6.1% for the current fiscal year, while the central bank has forecast 6.5% rise.

""While the world is in the midst of an unprecedented period of transition and uncertainty, India faces a defining opportunity to capitalize on this moment,"" said the S&P Global in its report ""Look Forward: India's Moment"" released in Delhi.

S&P Global expects the size of the economy to reach $6.7 trillion from $3.4 trillion in fiscal 2023, which could see per capita GDP rise to about $4,500.

If realised, India would overtake Japan and Germany to become the third largest economy in the world.

In manufacturing, new opportunities are expected to emerge from an accelerating global trend towards supply chain diversification, said the report, as the government offered incentives to manufacturers and improving infrastructure.

The economy is set to benefit from efficiency gains from tax reforms, state support to digital and physical infrastructure and reducing leakages from government subsidy transfers.

The Indian consumer market will more than double by 2031, surging to $5.2 trillion from $2.3 trillion in 2022, driven by rise in household incomes and higher spending on food and other items.

""Higher per capita incomes will also likely boost discretionary spending in areas such as entertainment, communications, restaurants and hotels,"" said the report.

S&P Global said developing a strong logistics framework will be key in transforming India from a services-dominated economy to a manufacturing-dominant one, besides increasing female participation in the workforce to realize a demographic dividend.

""India's ability to become a major global manufacturing hub will be a paramount test for its economic future.""

'Stop machine' - Russia releases video showing navy boarding cargo ship in Black Sea,"MOSCOW, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Russia on Tuesday released video footage showing an armed naval inspection unit boarding a cargo ship in the southwestern Black Sea on Sunday and questioning the captain about why the ship had not stopped when demanded to by a Russian warship.

Russia said that it fired warning shots with automatic weapons at the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan vessel after it failed to respond to a demand for it to halt, though it was unclear why the ship was boarded so close to Turkey.

In a video released by the Russian defence ministry, crew members can be seen kneeling on deck with their hands on their head as a Russian Ka-29 helicopter approaches.

What appears to be bodycam footage from the naval unit, shows Russian servicemen with automatic weapons checking the ship and entering the bridge.

""Stop machine, stop machine,"" one of the armed Russians says as crew members put their hands on their heads and kneel before the Russian weapons.

""Keep calm and listen to me,"" another Russian says.

""Good day sir. I am Russian naval officer - please don't shoot my group on video.""

Firing on a merchant vessel ratcheted up already acute concerns among shipowners, insurers and commodity traders about the dangers of getting ensnared in the Black Sea - the main route that both Ukraine and Russia use to get their agricultural produce to market.

Reuters could not reach the vessel or its owners for comment.

""During the inspection activities carried out, the work of the inspection team was carried out professionally in accordance with the requirements of international documents,"" the defence ministry said.

""After the completion of the work of the inspection team on board the Sukru Okan, a verification protocol was drawn up, the ship continued to move to the port of Izmail.""

The video shows the language barriers.

In one cut, a Russian demands: ""Speak English.""

""Yes, I am speaking English,"" one of the crew replies.

The Russian officer then questions the captain through a crew translator about why the ship did not stop when asked to.

The crew member translating for the captain indicates that the captain had not understood the Russian demand to stop.

""You, bad understand,"" the crew member says in English.

""Thank you, you good day sir,"" the Russian officer says as he leaves.

Admiral tops STOXX 600 after results

STOXX 600 down 0.1%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday on a drag from banks, as increasing evidence of China's economy rapidly losing steam kept investors on the edge, while UK stocks came under pressure from rising worries over sticky inflation.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) closed the day 0.1% lower, after falling as much as 0.4% and touching a new one-month low intraday.

The European banks index (.SX7P) lost 0.7%, touching a one-week low, with China-exposed HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) falling for the fifth session and shedding 1.7% to a more than two-month low.

Luxury giants LVMH (LVMH.PA) and Kering (PRTP.PA), exposed to Chinese consumer demand, also lost 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.

Missed payments on investment products by a leading Chinese trust firm and a fall in home prices added to worries that China's deepening property sector crisis is stifling what little momentum the economy has left.

""China sneezes the rest of the world gets a cold; any data points showing Chinese economy not running well is negative for global markets, particularly Europe, in terms of consumer demand from China,"" said Michael Field, European Equity Strategist at Morningstar.

Further, a flash estimate showed euro zone's second-quarter GDP rose by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, while another data set showed June industrial production increased by 0.5% month-on-month.

The STOXX 600, weighed down by signs of slowing growth in China, has underperformed its U.S. peers this year, with its 7.2% gain well below the 15.3% jump in the S&P 500 index (.SPX).

Meanwhile, UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 (.FTSE) fell 0.4% on growing worries about persistently high British inflation as key measures of price growth monitored by the Bank of England failed to ease in July, despite a sharp drop in headline inflation.

""While it's good to celebrate inflation coming down to this point, we have to recognise that from here the bulk of core inflation is far more difficult to get down,"" Morningstar's Field added.

Among major individual movers, British motor and home insurer Admiral Group (ADML.L) jumped 7.2% to top the STOXX 600 following a marginal rise in first-half pre-tax profit.

Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) slumped 10.6% to the bottom of STOXX 600, after its CEO said the infrastructure firm is facing challenges in its U.S. office projects.

German life-science company Bayer (BAYGn.DE) lost 1.7% following a Berenberg rating downgrade to ""hold"" from ""buy"".

Second-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to decrease 4.6% from a year earlier, slightly less than the 4.8%-drop estimated last week, Refinitiv data showed.

Libya clashes toll hits 55 dead - medical agency,"[1/2] Members of the Security personnel affiliated with the Ministry of Interior secure the streets after yesterday's clashes between armed factions in Tripoli, Libya, August 16, 2023 REUTERS/Hazem Ahmed Acquire Licensing Rights

TRIPOLI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The casualty toll from clashes in Libya's capital Tripoli over Monday and Tuesday was 55 killed and 146 wounded, the emergency services said.

City elders announced late on Tuesday that they had brokered a deal to end Tripoli's deadliest violence in years with the Special Deterrence Force handing 444 Brigade commander Mahmoud Hamza over to a third faction, the Stability Support Apparatus.

Hamza had been seized by the Special Deterrence Force, which controls Mitiga airport, as he attempted to travel on Monday.

Airlines that on Tuesday stopped using Mitiga airport, where some of the worst fighting took place, resumed flights on Wednesday, they said.

As part of the deal announced by the elders, police and other security forces that stayed neutral in the clashes moved into areas where the fighting took place.

However, the dispute remains unresolved and a source in 444 Brigade said it might resume military operations if Hamza was not returned to his own base.

Major warfare in Libya has been paused since a 2020 truce between the main eastern and western sides, but rival factions still hold most territory and a lasting solution to the conflict that has raged since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising looks distant.

"China military action to US stopover would be election interference, Taiwan VP says","Taiwan's Vice President William Lai speaks during a welcome dinner in Asuncion, Paraguay, in this handout picture released on August 15, 2023. Taiwan Presidential Office/Handout via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights

TAIPEI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Any Chinese military action in response to stopovers in the U.S. by Taiwan Vice President William Lai would be an attempt by China to interfere in the island's elections, Lai said during a trip to Paraguay.

Taiwanese officials say China could launch military drills this week, using Lai's stopovers in the United States as a pretext to intimidate voters ahead of an election next year and make them ""fear war"".

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has a particular dislike of Lai who has in the past described himself as a ""practical worker for Taiwan independence"". He is the front-runner to become the next president in January's election.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Paraguay, where he arrived via New York, Lai said such U.S. transits were routine and China had no cause to use them as an excuse to ""verbally and militarily intimidate Taiwan"", the island's official Central News Agency reported.

""If China uses the transits as an excuse to again launch verbal and military intimidation or other threatening methods, it just confirms international media reports that China is attempting to intervene in Taiwan's election with military threats,"" the news agency cited Lai as saying.

Lai, however, said he had confidence in Taiwan's people.

Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday it had yet to see any large-scale Chinese manoeuvres near the island.

In April, China held war games around Taiwan after President Tsai Ing-wen returned from California where she met U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on her way back from Central America.

China has denounced Lai's New York stop - he is due in San Francisco on Wednesday on his way back to Taipei - and said he is a separatist ""troublemaker"".

Both Taiwan and the United States have sought to keep Lai's U.S. stopovers low key, and Lai said there were ""no special arrangements"" to meet with U.S. officials.

China considers Taiwan to be its most sensitive and important political and diplomatic issue, and it is a constant source of Sino-U.S. friction.

Speaking at a conference in Moscow on Tuesday, Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu said ""playing with fire on the Taiwan issue and vainly trying to 'control China with Taiwan' is bound to end in failure"".

Lai has been in Paraguay for the inauguration of its new president. It is one of only 13 countries to maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Lai posted on his Facebook pages pictures of him in Asuncion shaking hands with and chatting to U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, as well as Spain's King Felipe VI and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who were there for the same event.

China says Taiwan has no right to state-to-state ties and has been trying to pick off Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies. Honduras, once a stalwart friend of Taipei's, switched ties to Beijing in March.

Maui wildfire shutters treasured Hawaiian language school,"A view of burned debris after wildfires devastated the historic town of Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, U.S., August 10, 2023. Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Punana Leo language-immersion school in Lahaina, the historic former capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, stood for decades as a gleaming symbol of the fight to stop Hawaiian language and culture from disappearing forever.

Last week the preschool became one of the casualties of a wildfire inferno that displaced thousands, upended Maui's tourism-fueled economy and killed more than 100 people - a number that is expected to rise as the search for the missing pushes ahead.

The school was decimated, said Ka'iulani Laeha, chief executive officer of Aha Punana Leo, the nonprofit organization that ran the Lahaina school. It burned down alongside historic Waiola Church, a 200-year-old building that once served as the burial place for some of Hawaii's royal family.

""This is a huge devastation to that community as a whole,"" Laeha said, adding that a majority of the dozens of students and faculty at Punana Leo also lost their homes last week when the fire raced through the West Maui town, leaving a trail of ashes in its wake. Thankfully, she said, everyone had been found safe or accounted for.

The Lahaina Punana Leo was one of Aha Punana Leo's 13 schools across Hawaii dedicated to immersing young people in Olelo Hawaii, the ancestral language of the archipelago, which came close to extinction before an organized campaign to save it began in the 1970s. Punana Leo is Hawaiian for ""nest of voices.""

The loss of the school is especially painful because of its location in Lahaina, a focal point of Hawaii's Polynesian culture. It was one of the first centers established under a movement to revive the language after a government ban on teaching Hawaiian was lifted in 1978.

Punana Leo schools predate the Hawaii Department of Education's own language immersion program established a few years later in the late 1980s. The department oversees around two dozen public schools offering Hawaiian immersion.

When foreign settlers first arrived to the Hawaiian Islands in the 1800s, around 400,000 to 800,000 people spoke Olelo Hawaii. By the 1980s, only a few hundred native speakers were left.

Today, there are only an estimated 26,000 Hawaiian language speakers even with some 309,000 people identifying as at least partially Hawaiian, according to the 2021 U.S. census.

Kaliko Baker, an associate professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said the fire destroyed more than just a building. The school was symbolic of the health of a culture that has survived years of struggle, he said.

""Language to a people is a cornerstone,"" Baker said, ""upon which a foundation is set to build the character of the national ethnic identity.""

Learning a language is key to the identity of a people, he said. ""We learn who we were, which informs who we are today, and who we'd like to be in the future.""

Despite efforts by Aha Punana Leo and the education department, the Hawaiian language remains on UNESCO's endangered language list, highlighting the continued need for schools such as Punana Leo in Lahaina.

All three of the state-run immersion schools located in Lahaina remain closed following the fire, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.

Lahaina schools had a total enrollment of about 3,000 students, with hundreds of faculty and staff.

In a statement Tuesday, Superintendent Keith Hayashi said the schools only suffered minor damages.

But the top priority from both the Department of Education and Aha Punana Leo remains the immediate safety of students and residents.

""We have every intention to rebuild in the long term,"" Laeha said. ""But for right now, our priority is making sure that everyone is supported in the ways that they need.""

Indian government plans stake sale in Indian Railways' funding arm - sources,"NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Indian government is considering selling some of its stake in the state-owned Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) (INID.NS) as it aims to meet its divestment targets for the year, two government officials told Reuters on Wednesday.

The government owns a little over 86% of the Indian Railways' funding arm.

""The stake sale would take place soon,"" a government official said, adding that while the government is yet to decide the exact quantum of sale, it will aim to sell up to 11% in multiple tranches.

Last month, the government sold a more-than-5% stake in another state-run railways company, Rail Vikas Nigam, raising 13.66 billion rupees ($164.34 million).

So far in fiscal 2024, it has raised 56 billion rupees against a target of 510 billion rupees.

The Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The sale would also have the added advantage of the government adhering to the regulator-mandated minimum public shareholding norms, which requires that public companies maintain at least 25% public shareholding.

While state-run firms have greater leeway in this regard, the government intends to bring down its shareholding in line with the norms.

Lawmakers urge Biden to resolve offloading delay of seized Iran oil tanker,"The Houston Ship Channel and adjacent refineries, part of the Port of Houston, are seen in Houston, Texas, U.S., May 5, 2019. REUTERS/Loren Elliott//File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have urged President Joe Biden and members of his administration to resolve a months-long delay in the transfer of a cargo of oil from a seized Iranian tanker off Texas.

The Suez Rajan has been stuck near Galveston about 50 miles (80 km) from Houston since May 30, as shipping companies fear any vessel unloading it would lead other oil buyers to shun their ships on future voyages. The U.S. seized the tanker in a sanctions enforcement operation.

The delay in discharging the cargo is also partly out of fear of repercussions from Iran. A senior commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' navy said last month Iran would retaliate against any oil company unloading Iranian oil from a seized tanker.

Senators Joni Ernst, a Republican, and Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and other lawmakers in the Senate and U.S. House said in the letter to Biden and senior administration officials that enforcement of petroleum sanctions will become irrelevant if American citizens and companies involved constantly live in fear of Iranian retaliation.

""It is imperative that the Administration make clear that Iran and designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations cannot prevent our government from carrying out legitimate law enforcement operations,"" the lawmakers said in the letter sent late on Tuesday and seen by Reuters.

They asked the administration for a briefing on the progress of the transfer of the seized oil from the Suez Rajan to U.S. custody.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The saga of the tanker is occurring as Washington and Tehran seek a deal to free five detained U.S. citizens in exchange for releasing $6 billion in Iranian funds frozen in South Korea. A deal would remove a major irritant between Washington and Tehran, which are at odds on issues from the Iranian nuclear program to Tehran's support for regional Shi'ite militias.

The lawmakers estimated the value of the oil on the 800,000 barrel tanker to be $56 million. U.S. seizures of Iranian oil contribute money to the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, which compensates victims of attacks. A fund official has determined there are insufficient assets for a round of payments next year to the nearly 16,000 Americans.

Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Punana Leo language-immersion school in Lahaina, the historic former capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, stood for decades as a gleaming symbol of the fight to stop Hawaiian language and culture from disappearing forever.

Last week the preschool became one of the casualties of a wildfire inferno that displaced thousands, upended Maui's tourism-fueled economy and killed more than 100 people - a number that is expected to rise as the search for the missing pushes ahead.

The school was decimated, said Ka'iulani Laeha, chief executive officer of Aha Punana Leo, the nonprofit organization that ran the Lahaina school. It burned down alongside historic Waiola Church, a 200-year-old building that once served as the burial place for some of Hawaii's royal family.

""This is a huge devastation to that community as a whole,"" Laeha said, adding that a majority of the dozens of students and faculty at Punana Leo also lost their homes last week when the fire raced through the West Maui town, leaving a trail of ashes in its wake. Thankfully, she said, everyone had been found safe or accounted for.

The Lahaina Punana Leo was one of Aha Punana Leo's 13 schools across Hawaii dedicated to immersing young people in Olelo Hawaii, the ancestral language of the archipelago, which came close to extinction before an organized campaign to save it began in the 1970s. Punana Leo is Hawaiian for ""nest of voices.""

The loss of the school is especially painful because of its location in Lahaina, a focal point of Hawaii's Polynesian culture. It was one of the first centers established under a movement to revive the language after a government ban on teaching Hawaiian was lifted in 1978.

Punana Leo schools predate the Hawaii Department of Education's own language immersion program established a few years later in the late 1980s. The department oversees around two dozen public schools offering Hawaiian immersion.

When foreign settlers first arrived to the Hawaiian Islands in the 1800s, around 400,000 to 800,000 people spoke Olelo Hawaii. By the 1980s, only a few hundred native speakers were left.

Today, there are only an estimated 26,000 Hawaiian language speakers even with some 309,000 people identifying as at least partially Hawaiian, according to the 2021 U.S. census.

Kaliko Baker, an associate professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said the fire destroyed more than just a building. The school was symbolic of the health of a culture that has survived years of struggle, he said.

""Language to a people is a cornerstone,"" Baker said, ""upon which a foundation is set to build the character of the national ethnic identity.""

Learning a language is key to the identity of a people, he said. ""We learn who we were, which informs who we are today, and who we'd like to be in the future.""

Despite efforts by Aha Punana Leo and the education department, the Hawaiian language remains on UNESCO's endangered language list, highlighting the continued need for schools such as Punana Leo in Lahaina.

All three of the state-run immersion schools located in Lahaina remain closed following the fire, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.

Lahaina schools had a total enrollment of about 3,000 students, with hundreds of faculty and staff.

In a statement Tuesday, Superintendent Keith Hayashi said the schools only suffered minor damages.

But the top priority from both the Department of Education and Aha Punana Leo remains the immediate safety of students and residents.

""We have every intention to rebuild in the long term,"" Laeha said. ""But for right now, our priority is making sure that everyone is supported in the ways that they need.""

Indian government plans stake sale in Indian Railways' funding arm - sources,"NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Indian government is considering selling some of its stake in the state-owned Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) (INID.NS) as it aims to meet its divestment targets for the year, two government officials told Reuters on Wednesday.

The government owns a little over 86% of the Indian Railways' funding arm.

""The stake sale would take place soon,"" a government official said, adding that while the government is yet to decide the exact quantum of sale, it will aim to sell up to 11% in multiple tranches.

Last month, the government sold a more-than-5% stake in another state-run railways company, Rail Vikas Nigam, raising 13.66 billion rupees ($164.34 million).

So far in fiscal 2024, it has raised 56 billion rupees against a target of 510 billion rupees.

The Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The sale would also have the added advantage of the government adhering to the regulator-mandated minimum public shareholding norms, which requires that public companies maintain at least 25% public shareholding.

While state-run firms have greater leeway in this regard, the government intends to bring down its shareholding in line with the norms.

Shares of IRFC have gained 58% over the last four weeks. The stock was trading at 51.55 rupees per share at 01.42 p.m. IST on Wednesday, up 1%.

Lawmakers urge Biden to resolve offloading delay of seized Iran oil tanker,"The Houston Ship Channel and adjacent refineries, part of the Port of Houston, are seen in Houston, Texas, U.S., May 5, 2019. REUTERS/Loren Elliott//File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have urged President Joe Biden and members of his administration to resolve a months-long delay in the transfer of a cargo of oil from a seized Iranian tanker off Texas.

The Suez Rajan has been stuck near Galveston about 50 miles (80 km) from Houston since May 30, as shipping companies fear any vessel unloading it would lead other oil buyers to shun their ships on future voyages. The U.S. seized the tanker in a sanctions enforcement operation.

The delay in discharging the cargo is also partly out of fear of repercussions from Iran. A senior commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' navy said last month Iran would retaliate against any oil company unloading Iranian oil from a seized tanker.

Senators Joni Ernst, a Republican, and Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and other lawmakers in the Senate and U.S. House said in the letter to Biden and senior administration officials that enforcement of petroleum sanctions will become irrelevant if American citizens and companies involved constantly live in fear of Iranian retaliation.

""It is imperative that the Administration make clear that Iran and designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations cannot prevent our government from carrying out legitimate law enforcement operations,"" the lawmakers said in the letter sent late on Tuesday and seen by Reuters.

They asked the administration for a briefing on the progress of the transfer of the seized oil from the Suez Rajan to U.S. custody.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The saga of the tanker is occurring as Washington and Tehran seek a deal to free five detained U.S. citizens in exchange for releasing $6 billion in Iranian funds frozen in South Korea. A deal would remove a major irritant between Washington and Tehran, which are at odds on issues from the Iranian nuclear program to Tehran's support for regional Shi'ite militias.

The lawmakers estimated the value of the oil on the 800,000 barrel tanker to be $56 million. U.S. seizures of Iranian oil contribute money to the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, which compensates victims of attacks. A fund official has determined there are insufficient assets for a round of payments next year to the nearly 16,000 Americans.

BEIJING, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China will strengthen the coordination of various policies to boost growth and meet this year's economic target, according to a cabinet meeting cited by state media on Wednesday.

The meeting held on Wednesday comes amid China's mounting economic woes with a prolonged property crisis, deflationary pressure and slower growth in retail sales and industrial output.

Tuesday's grim data has raised calls from China watchers for authorities to roll out major fiscal stimulus to get the economy back on more solid footing.

Without giving details, the cabinet meeting chaired by premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies for boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Economists see a downside trend for the world's second-biggest economy. Barclays was among a number of global banks to cut its forecasts for China's 2023 growth after weak activity data.

Beijing pledged to boost the household consumption share of GDP to prop up economic growth as debt-fuelled investment in infrastructure and property has peaked and exports slumped due to weakening global demand.

However, despite a slew of policy announcements about how to boost growth, without direct stimulus such as consumer vouchers and tax cuts, Chinese households have continued to build up savings and reduce borrowing - meaning demand remains sluggish.

""Prolonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well,"" said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank.

""In such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year's growth target of around 5%.""

Summary

Companies UK inflation data weighs on FTSE 100

Euro zone Q2 flash GDP rises 0.3% q/q

Balfour Beatty flags business hit from US tech downturn

Admiral tops STOXX 600 after results

STOXX 600 down 0.1%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - European shares fell on Wednesday on a drag from banks, as increasing evidence of China's economy rapidly losing steam kept investors on the edge, while UK stocks came under pressure from rising worries over sticky inflation.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) closed the day 0.1% lower, after falling as much as 0.4% and touching a new one-month low intraday.

The European banks index (.SX7P) lost 0.7%, touching a one-week low, with China-exposed HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) falling for the fifth session and shedding 1.7% to a more than two-month low.

Luxury giants LVMH (LVMH.PA) and Kering (PRTP.PA), exposed to Chinese consumer demand, also lost 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.

Missed payments on investment products by a leading Chinese trust firm and a fall in home prices added to worries that China's deepening property sector crisis is stifling what little momentum the economy has left.

""China sneezes the rest of the world gets a cold; any data points showing Chinese economy not running well is negative for global markets, particularly Europe, in terms of consumer demand from China,"" said Michael Field, European Equity Strategist at Morningstar.

Further, a flash estimate showed euro zone's second-quarter GDP rose by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter, while another data set showed June industrial production increased by 0.5% month-on-month.

The STOXX 600, weighed down by signs of slowing growth in China, has underperformed its U.S. peers this year, with its 7.2% gain well below the 15.3% jump in the S&P 500 index (.SPX).

Meanwhile, UK's blue-chip FTSE 100 (.FTSE) fell 0.4% on growing worries about persistently high British inflation as key measures of price growth monitored by the Bank of England failed to ease in July, despite a sharp drop in headline inflation.

""While it's good to celebrate inflation coming down to this point, we have to recognise that from here the bulk of core inflation is far more difficult to get down,"" Morningstar's Field added.

Among major individual movers, British motor and home insurer Admiral Group (ADML.L) jumped 7.2% to top the STOXX 600 following a marginal rise in first-half pre-tax profit.

Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) slumped 10.6% to the bottom of STOXX 600, after its CEO said the infrastructure firm is facing challenges in its U.S. office projects.

German life-science company Bayer (BAYGn.DE) lost 1.7% following a Berenberg rating downgrade to ""hold"" from ""buy"".

Second-quarter earnings for European firms are expected to decrease 4.6% from a year earlier, slightly less than the 4.8%-drop estimated last week, Refinitiv data showed.

Libya clashes toll hits 55 dead - medical agency,"[1/2] Members of the Security personnel affiliated with the Ministry of Interior secure the streets after yesterday's clashes between armed factions in Tripoli, Libya, August 16, 2023 REUTERS/Hazem Ahmed Acquire Licensing Rights

TRIPOLI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The casualty toll from clashes in Libya's capital Tripoli over Monday and Tuesday was 55 killed and 146 wounded, the emergency services said.

City elders announced late on Tuesday that they had brokered a deal to end Tripoli's deadliest violence in years with the Special Deterrence Force handing 444 Brigade commander Mahmoud Hamza over to a third faction, the Stability Support Apparatus.

Hamza had been seized by the Special Deterrence Force, which controls Mitiga airport, as he attempted to travel on Monday.

Airlines that on Tuesday stopped using Mitiga airport, where some of the worst fighting took place, resumed flights on Wednesday, they said.

As part of the deal announced by the elders, police and other security forces that stayed neutral in the clashes moved into areas where the fighting took place.

However, the dispute remains unresolved and a source in 444 Brigade said it might resume military operations if Hamza was not returned to his own base.

Major warfare in Libya has been paused since a 2020 truce between the main eastern and western sides, but rival factions still hold most territory and a lasting solution to the conflict that has raged since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising looks distant.

"China military action to US stopover would be election interference, Taiwan VP says","Taiwan's Vice President William Lai speaks during a welcome dinner in Asuncion, Paraguay, in this handout picture released on August 15, 2023. Taiwan Presidential Office/Handout via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights

TAIPEI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Any Chinese military action in response to stopovers in the U.S. by Taiwan Vice President William Lai would be an attempt by China to interfere in the island's elections, Lai said during a trip to Paraguay.

Taiwanese officials say China could launch military drills this week, using Lai's stopovers in the United States as a pretext to intimidate voters ahead of an election next year and make them ""fear war"".

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has a particular dislike of Lai who has in the past described himself as a ""practical worker for Taiwan independence"". He is the front-runner to become the next president in January's election.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Paraguay, where he arrived via New York, Lai said such U.S. transits were routine and China had no cause to use them as an excuse to ""verbally and militarily intimidate Taiwan"", the island's official Central News Agency reported.

""If China uses the transits as an excuse to again launch verbal and military intimidation or other threatening methods, it just confirms international media reports that China is attempting to intervene in Taiwan's election with military threats,"" the news agency cited Lai as saying.

Lai, however, said he had confidence in Taiwan's people.

Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday it had yet to see any large-scale Chinese manoeuvres near the island.

In April, China held war games around Taiwan after President Tsai Ing-wen returned from California where she met U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on her way back from Central America.

China has denounced Lai's New York stop - he is due in San Francisco on Wednesday on his way back to Taipei - and said he is a separatist ""troublemaker"".

Both Taiwan and the United States have sought to keep Lai's U.S. stopovers low key, and Lai said there were ""no special arrangements"" to meet with U.S. officials.

China considers Taiwan to be its most sensitive and important political and diplomatic issue, and it is a constant source of Sino-U.S. friction.

Speaking at a conference in Moscow on Tuesday, Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu said ""playing with fire on the Taiwan issue and vainly trying to 'control China with Taiwan' is bound to end in failure"".

Lai has been in Paraguay for the inauguration of its new president. It is one of only 13 countries to maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Lai posted on his Facebook pages pictures of him in Asuncion shaking hands with and chatting to U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, as well as Spain's King Felipe VI and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who were there for the same event.

China says Taiwan has no right to state-to-state ties and has been trying to pick off Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies. Honduras, once a stalwart friend of Taipei's, switched ties to Beijing in March.

Speaking at a conference in Moscow on Tuesday, Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu said ""playing with fire on the Taiwan issue and vainly trying to 'control China with Taiwan' is bound to end in failure"".

Lai has been in Paraguay for the inauguration of its new president. It is one of only 13 countries to maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Lai posted on his Facebook pages pictures of him in Asuncion shaking hands with and chatting to U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, as well as Spain's King Felipe VI and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who were there for the same event.

China says Taiwan has no right to state-to-state ties and has been trying to pick off Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies. Honduras, once a stalwart friend of Taipei's, switched ties to Beijing in March.

Maui wildfire shutters treasured Hawaiian language school,"A view of burned debris after wildfires devastated the historic town of Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, U.S., August 10, 2023. Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Punana Leo language-immersion school in Lahaina, the historic former capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, stood for decades as a gleaming symbol of the fight to stop Hawaiian language and culture from disappearing forever.

Last week the preschool became one of the casualties of a wildfire inferno that displaced thousands, upended Maui's tourism-fueled economy and killed more than 100 people - a number that is expected to rise as the search for the missing pushes ahead.

The school was decimated, said Ka'iulani Laeha, chief executive officer of Aha Punana Leo, the nonprofit organization that ran the Lahaina school. It burned down alongside historic Waiola Church, a 200-year-old building that once served as the burial place for some of Hawaii's royal family.

""This is a huge devastation to that community as a whole,"" Laeha said, adding that a majority of the dozens of students and faculty at Punana Leo also lost their homes last week when the fire raced through the West Maui town, leaving a trail of ashes in its wake. Thankfully, she said, everyone had been found safe or accounted for.

The Lahaina Punana Leo was one of Aha Punana Leo's 13 schools across Hawaii dedicated to immersing young people in Olelo Hawaii, the ancestral language of the archipelago, which came close to extinction before an organized campaign to save it began in the 1970s. Punana Leo is Hawaiian for ""nest of voices.""

The loss of the school is especially painful because of its location in Lahaina, a focal point of Hawaii's Polynesian culture. It was one of the first centers established under a movement to revive the language after a government ban on teaching Hawaiian was lifted in 1978.

Punana Leo schools predate the Hawaii Department of Education's own language immersion program established a few years later in the late 1980s. The department oversees around two dozen public schools offering Hawaiian immersion.

When foreign settlers first arrived to the Hawaiian Islands in the 1800s, around 400,000 to 800,000 people spoke Olelo Hawaii. By the 1980s, only a few hundred native speakers were left.

Today, there are only an estimated 26,000 Hawaiian language speakers even with some 309,000 people identifying as at least partially Hawaiian, according to the 2021 U.S. census.

Kaliko Baker, an associate professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said the fire destroyed more than just a building. The school was symbolic of the health of a culture that has survived years of struggle, he said.

""Language to a people is a cornerstone,"" Baker said, ""upon which a foundation is set to build the character of the national ethnic identity.""

Learning a language is key to the identity of a people, he said. ""We learn who we were, which informs who we are today, and who we'd like to be in the future.""

Despite efforts by Aha Punana Leo and the education department, the Hawaiian language remains on UNESCO's endangered language list, highlighting the continued need for schools such as Punana Leo in Lahaina.

All three of the state-run immersion schools located in Lahaina remain closed following the fire, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.

Lahaina schools had a total enrollment of about 3,000 students, with hundreds of faculty and staff.

In a statement Tuesday, Superintendent Keith Hayashi said the schools only suffered minor damages.

But the top priority from both the Department of Education and Aha Punana Leo remains the immediate safety of students and residents.

""We have every intention to rebuild in the long term,"" Laeha said. ""But for right now, our priority is making sure that everyone is supported in the ways that they need.""

Indian government plans stake sale in Indian Railways' funding arm - sources,"NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Indian government is considering selling some of its stake in the state-owned Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) (INID.NS) as it aims to meet its divestment targets for the year, two government officials told Reuters on Wednesday.

The government owns a little over 86% of the Indian Railways' funding arm.

""The stake sale would take place soon,"" a government official said, adding that while the government is yet to decide the exact quantum of sale, it will aim to sell up to 11% in multiple tranches.

Last month, the government sold a more-than-5% stake in another state-run railways company, Rail Vikas Nigam, raising 13.66 billion rupees ($164.34 million).

So far in fiscal 2024, it has raised 56 billion rupees against a target of 510 billion rupees.

The Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The sale would also have the added advantage of the government adhering to the regulator-mandated minimum public shareholding norms, which requires that public companies maintain at least 25% public shareholding.

While state-run firms have greater leeway in this regard, the government intends to bring down its shareholding in line with the norms.

Shares of IRFC have gained 58% over the last four weeks. The stock was trading at 51.55 rupees per share at 01.42 p.m. IST on Wednesday, up 1%.

Lawmakers urge Biden to resolve offloading delay of seized Iran oil tanker,"The Houston Ship Channel and adjacent refineries, part of the Port of Houston, are seen in Houston, Texas, U.S., May 5, 2019. REUTERS/Loren Elliott//File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have urged President Joe Biden and members of his administration to resolve a months-long delay in the transfer of a cargo of oil from a seized Iranian tanker off Texas.

The Suez Rajan has been stuck near Galveston about 50 miles (80 km) from Houston since May 30, as shipping companies fear any vessel unloading it would lead other oil buyers to shun their ships on future voyages. The U.S. seized the tanker in a sanctions enforcement operation.

The delay in discharging the cargo is also partly out of fear of repercussions from Iran. A senior commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' navy said last month Iran would retaliate against any oil company unloading Iranian oil from a seized tanker.

Senators Joni Ernst, a Republican, and Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and other lawmakers in the Senate and U.S. House said in the letter to Biden and senior administration officials that enforcement of petroleum sanctions will become irrelevant if American citizens and companies involved constantly live in fear of Iranian retaliation.

""It is imperative that the Administration make clear that Iran and designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations cannot prevent our government from carrying out legitimate law enforcement operations,"" the lawmakers said in the letter sent late on Tuesday and seen by Reuters.

They asked the administration for a briefing on the progress of the transfer of the seized oil from the Suez Rajan to U.S. custody.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The saga of the tanker is occurring as Washington and Tehran seek a deal to free five detained U.S. citizens in exchange for releasing $6 billion in Iranian funds frozen in South Korea. A deal would remove a major irritant between Washington and Tehran, which are at odds on issues from the Iranian nuclear program to Tehran's support for regional Shi'ite militias.

The lawmakers estimated the value of the oil on the 800,000 barrel tanker to be $56 million. U.S. seizures of Iranian oil contribute money to the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, which compensates victims of attacks. A fund official has determined there are insufficient assets for a round of payments next year to the nearly 16,000 Americans.

BEIJING, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China will strengthen the coordination of various policies to boost growth and meet this year's economic target, according to a cabinet meeting cited by state media on Wednesday.

The meeting held on Wednesday comes amid China's mounting economic woes with a prolonged property crisis, deflationary pressure and slower growth in retail sales and industrial output.

Tuesday's grim data has raised calls from China watchers for authorities to roll out major fiscal stimulus to get the economy back on more solid footing.

Without giving details, the cabinet meeting chaired by premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies for boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Economists see a downside trend for the world's second-biggest economy. Barclays was among a number of global banks to cut its forecasts for China's 2023 growth after weak activity data.

Beijing pledged to boost the household consumption share of GDP to prop up economic growth as debt-fuelled investment in infrastructure and property has peaked and exports slumped due to weakening global demand.

However, despite a slew of policy announcements about how to boost growth, without direct stimulus such as consumer vouchers and tax cuts, Chinese households have continued to build up savings and reduce borrowing - meaning demand remains sluggish.

""Prolonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well,"" said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank.

""In such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year's growth target of around 5%.""

BEIJING, Aug 16 - Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that he plans to ask China to take a stronger position on Ukraine and to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war.

""We need China to take a stronger position,"" Rasmussen told Reuters in Shanghai at the start of his three-day visit to China.

""Putin is not listening to European leaders, but is clearly listening to China. So I want to argue that China should speak up,"" he said.

Rasmussen said he will discuss Ukraine and bilateral cooperation on green energy with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi when the two meet on Friday in Beijing. He will also meet Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Thursday.

Denmark is a strong supporter of the Ukraine war effort. In June, it increased its military aid to Ukraine to over $3 billion over the next five years.

Lahaina wildfire insured property loss to be about $3.2 bln - KCC,"The damage at the Ho'Onanea condominium complex is seen in the aftermath of a wildfire, in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, U.S. August 10, 2023. REUTERS/Jorge Garcia Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Insured property losses from the wildfire that ravaged the resort town of Lahaina in Hawaii last week are estimated to be about $3.2 billion, catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Company (KCC) said on Wednesday.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The fire charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours and has brought with it the logistical challenges of recovery, taking a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

More than 2,200 structures fall within the fire perimeter, KCC estimated, citing an independent geospatial analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

The majority of damaged structures were residential buildings, though many commercial buildings were affected as well, KCC said, adding that the disaster was the most destructive wildfire in Hawaii history.

The high proportion of wood frame and older construction present in the Lahaina buildings likely contributed to the damage, it said.

Insurance broker Aon last week said the extreme devastation to homes, businesses and other structures in Lahaina would likely drive economic and insured losses into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Moody's Investors' Service said on Tuesday that estimated insured losses from wildfires on Maui in Hawaii would be at least $1 billion.

The report said large insurers such as State Farm, Tokio Marine (8766.T), Allstate (ALL.N) have exposure in Hawaii, but added the companies are expected to readily absorb the losses as their business in Hawaii is a small fraction of their overall insured portfolios.

TAIPEI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Any Chinese military action in response to stopovers in the U.S. by Taiwan Vice President William Lai would be an attempt by China to interfere in the island's elections, Lai said during a trip to Paraguay.

Taiwanese officials say China could launch military drills this week, using Lai's stopovers in the United States as a pretext to intimidate voters ahead of an election next year and make them ""fear war"".

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has a particular dislike of Lai who has in the past described himself as a ""practical worker for Taiwan independence"". He is the front-runner to become the next president in January's election.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Paraguay, where he arrived via New York, Lai said such U.S. transits were routine and China had no cause to use them as an excuse to ""verbally and militarily intimidate Taiwan"", the island's official Central News Agency reported.

""If China uses the transits as an excuse to again launch verbal and military intimidation or other threatening methods, it just confirms international media reports that China is attempting to intervene in Taiwan's election with military threats,"" the news agency cited Lai as saying.

Lai, however, said he had confidence in Taiwan's people.

Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday it had yet to see any large-scale Chinese manoeuvres near the island.

In April, China held war games around Taiwan after President Tsai Ing-wen returned from California where she met U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on her way back from Central America.

China has denounced Lai's New York stop - he is due in San Francisco on Wednesday on his way back to Taipei - and said he is a separatist ""troublemaker"".

Both Taiwan and the United States have sought to keep Lai's U.S. stopovers low key, and Lai said there were ""no special arrangements"" to meet with U.S. officials.

China considers Taiwan to be its most sensitive and important political and diplomatic issue, and it is a constant source of Sino-U.S. friction.

"To raise scarce dollars, Egypt looks to pension plans, draft evaders","A security man guards in front of a currency exchange bureau advertisement showing image of the U.S. dollar in Cairo, Egypt January 17, 2023. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

CAIRO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Egypt is offering a minimum $5,000 fee for Egyptians living abroad who wish to clear their military service obligations and a U.S. dollar pension plan also aimed at its citizens abroad, in a series of fresh measures designed to boost foreign currency inflows.

Over the past few months, state-owned banks have begun selling high-interest dollar-denominated bonds, and from May, a new law has granted temporary residence to foreigners who buy property for at least $50,000 or deposit $50,000 in state-owned banks.

Those initiatives follow a 2022 scheme to give Egyptian expatriates tax rebates for paying fees on car imports in hard currency, and other measures to attract foreign currency investments in land and industry.

Egypt has been drawing down its foreign currency assets for the last two years after a foreign borrowing spree, following the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. Remittances, by far Egypt's biggest source of foreign currency inflows, dropped sharply in January to March, compared to the same period in 2022, central bank data shows.

The pension plan lets Egyptians living abroad set up pension funds for a minimum $500 that would guarantee monthly payments in dollars for 10 to 15 years from the age of 50, according to a statement on Monday from the Financial Regulatory Authority.

The government will also raise foreign currency by allowing Egyptians living abroad, who are delinquent in their military service, to make good on their status permanently by paying either $5,000 or 5,000 euros during a one-month window, which started on Monday.

The foreign ministry on Tuesday announced a WhatsApp number and email address for enquiries about the scheme, which it said would be monitored around the clock, and urged applicants to register quickly.

Most Egyptian men between the ages of 19 and 30 are required to serve in the military. Many received temporary exemptions to travel for education, medical treatment or work, but end up remaining abroad. Those who do not comply with the service requirement would not be able to renew their passports.

The government has asked applicants to pay into a specially created account at the Abu Dhabi branch, in the United Arab Emirates, of Egypt's state-owned Banque Misr, which itself is headquartered in Egypt's capital Cairo.

The proposed military amnesty will also be available to men over 30 who fail to complete their service.

In the past, the government has allowed military service exemptions with payment of 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($97), provided the men return to Egypt and appear before a military panel to plead their case, said Mahmoud Salem, an Egyptian analyst living in Berlin. But the pound's value has diminished sharply in recent years.

In 2018, 8.9 million Egyptians lived abroad and 97.1 million in Egypt, according to the most recent figures from the central bank. Since then, the number of Egyptians living in Egypt has risen to 105 million.

Official data shows external debt rose to $165.4 billion by the end of March from under $40 billion in 2015. At least $50 billion in repayments will be due over the next few years, according to the central bank.

"China military action to US stopover would be election interference, Taiwan VP says","Taiwan's Vice President William Lai speaks during a welcome dinner in Asuncion, Paraguay, in this handout picture released on August 15, 2023. Taiwan Presidential Office/Handout via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights

TAIPEI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Any Chinese military action in response to stopovers in the U.S. by Taiwan Vice President William Lai would be an attempt by China to interfere in the island's elections, Lai said during a trip to Paraguay.

Taiwanese officials say China could launch military drills this week, using Lai's stopovers in the United States as a pretext to intimidate voters ahead of an election next year and make them ""fear war"".

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has a particular dislike of Lai who has in the past described himself as a ""practical worker for Taiwan independence"". He is the front-runner to become the next president in January's election.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Paraguay, where he arrived via New York, Lai said such U.S. transits were routine and China had no cause to use them as an excuse to ""verbally and militarily intimidate Taiwan"", the island's official Central News Agency reported.

""If China uses the transits as an excuse to again launch verbal and military intimidation or other threatening methods, it just confirms international media reports that China is attempting to intervene in Taiwan's election with military threats,"" the news agency cited Lai as saying.

Lai, however, said he had confidence in Taiwan's people.

Taiwan's defence ministry said on Tuesday it had yet to see any large-scale Chinese manoeuvres near the island.

In April, China held war games around Taiwan after President Tsai Ing-wen returned from California where she met U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on her way back from Central America.

China has denounced Lai's New York stop - he is due in San Francisco on Wednesday on his way back to Taipei - and said he is a separatist ""troublemaker"".

Both Taiwan and the United States have sought to keep Lai's U.S. stopovers low key, and Lai said there were ""no special arrangements"" to meet with U.S. officials.

China considers Taiwan to be its most sensitive and important political and diplomatic issue, and it is a constant source of Sino-U.S. friction.

Speaking at a conference in Moscow on Tuesday, Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu said ""playing with fire on the Taiwan issue and vainly trying to 'control China with Taiwan' is bound to end in failure"".

Lai has been in Paraguay for the inauguration of its new president. It is one of only 13 countries to maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.

Lai posted on his Facebook pages pictures of him in Asuncion shaking hands with and chatting to U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, as well as Spain's King Felipe VI and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who were there for the same event.

China says Taiwan has no right to state-to-state ties and has been trying to pick off Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies. Honduras, once a stalwart friend of Taipei's, switched ties to Beijing in March.

Maui wildfire shutters treasured Hawaiian language school,"A view of burned debris after wildfires devastated the historic town of Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, U.S., August 10, 2023. Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Punana Leo language-immersion school in Lahaina, the historic former capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, stood for decades as a gleaming symbol of the fight to stop Hawaiian language and culture from disappearing forever.

Last week the preschool became one of the casualties of a wildfire inferno that displaced thousands, upended Maui's tourism-fueled economy and killed more than 100 people - a number that is expected to rise as the search for the missing pushes ahead.

The school was decimated, said Ka'iulani Laeha, chief executive officer of Aha Punana Leo, the nonprofit organization that ran the Lahaina school. It burned down alongside historic Waiola Church, a 200-year-old building that once served as the burial place for some of Hawaii's royal family.

""This is a huge devastation to that community as a whole,"" Laeha said, adding that a majority of the dozens of students and faculty at Punana Leo also lost their homes last week when the fire raced through the West Maui town, leaving a trail of ashes in its wake. Thankfully, she said, everyone had been found safe or accounted for.

The Lahaina Punana Leo was one of Aha Punana Leo's 13 schools across Hawaii dedicated to immersing young people in Olelo Hawaii, the ancestral language of the archipelago, which came close to extinction before an organized campaign to save it began in the 1970s. Punana Leo is Hawaiian for ""nest of voices.""

The loss of the school is especially painful because of its location in Lahaina, a focal point of Hawaii's Polynesian culture. It was one of the first centers established under a movement to revive the language after a government ban on teaching Hawaiian was lifted in 1978.

Punana Leo schools predate the Hawaii Department of Education's own language immersion program established a few years later in the late 1980s. The department oversees around two dozen public schools offering Hawaiian immersion.

When foreign settlers first arrived to the Hawaiian Islands in the 1800s, around 400,000 to 800,000 people spoke Olelo Hawaii. By the 1980s, only a few hundred native speakers were left.

Today, there are only an estimated 26,000 Hawaiian language speakers even with some 309,000 people identifying as at least partially Hawaiian, according to the 2021 U.S. census.

Kaliko Baker, an associate professor of Hawaiian language at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said the fire destroyed more than just a building. The school was symbolic of the health of a culture that has survived years of struggle, he said.

""Language to a people is a cornerstone,"" Baker said, ""upon which a foundation is set to build the character of the national ethnic identity.""

Learning a language is key to the identity of a people, he said. ""We learn who we were, which informs who we are today, and who we'd like to be in the future.""

Despite efforts by Aha Punana Leo and the education department, the Hawaiian language remains on UNESCO's endangered language list, highlighting the continued need for schools such as Punana Leo in Lahaina.

All three of the state-run immersion schools located in Lahaina remain closed following the fire, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.

Lahaina schools had a total enrollment of about 3,000 students, with hundreds of faculty and staff.

In a statement Tuesday, Superintendent Keith Hayashi said the schools only suffered minor damages.

But the top priority from both the Department of Education and Aha Punana Leo remains the immediate safety of students and residents.

""We have every intention to rebuild in the long term,"" Laeha said. ""But for right now, our priority is making sure that everyone is supported in the ways that they need.""

Indian government plans stake sale in Indian Railways' funding arm - sources,"NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Indian government is considering selling some of its stake in the state-owned Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) (INID.NS) as it aims to meet its divestment targets for the year, two government officials told Reuters on Wednesday.

The government owns a little over 86% of the Indian Railways' funding arm.

""The stake sale would take place soon,"" a government official said, adding that while the government is yet to decide the exact quantum of sale, it will aim to sell up to 11% in multiple tranches.

Last month, the government sold a more-than-5% stake in another state-run railways company, Rail Vikas Nigam, raising 13.66 billion rupees ($164.34 million).

So far in fiscal 2024, it has raised 56 billion rupees against a target of 510 billion rupees.

The Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The sale would also have the added advantage of the government adhering to the regulator-mandated minimum public shareholding norms, which requires that public companies maintain at least 25% public shareholding.

While state-run firms have greater leeway in this regard, the government intends to bring down its shareholding in line with the norms.

Shares of IRFC have gained 58% over the last four weeks. The stock was trading at 51.55 rupees per share at 01.42 p.m. IST on Wednesday, up 1%.

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have urged President Joe Biden and members of his administration to resolve a months-long delay in the transfer of a cargo of oil from a seized Iranian tanker off Texas.

The Suez Rajan has been stuck near Galveston about 50 miles (80 km) from Houston since May 30, as shipping companies fear any vessel unloading it would lead other oil buyers to shun their ships on future voyages. The U.S. seized the tanker in a sanctions enforcement operation.

The delay in discharging the cargo is also partly out of fear of repercussions from Iran. A senior commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' navy said last month Iran would retaliate against any oil company unloading Iranian oil from a seized tanker.

Senators Joni Ernst, a Republican, and Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and other lawmakers in the Senate and U.S. House said in the letter to Biden and senior administration officials that enforcement of petroleum sanctions will become irrelevant if American citizens and companies involved constantly live in fear of Iranian retaliation.

""It is imperative that the Administration make clear that Iran and designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations cannot prevent our government from carrying out legitimate law enforcement operations,"" the lawmakers said in the letter sent late on Tuesday and seen by Reuters.

They asked the administration for a briefing on the progress of the transfer of the seized oil from the Suez Rajan to U.S. custody.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The saga of the tanker is occurring as Washington and Tehran seek a deal to free five detained U.S. citizens in exchange for releasing $6 billion in Iranian funds frozen in South Korea. A deal would remove a major irritant between Washington and Tehran, which are at odds on issues from the Iranian nuclear program to Tehran's support for regional Shi'ite militias.

The lawmakers estimated the value of the oil on the 800,000 barrel tanker to be $56 million. U.S. seizures of Iranian oil contribute money to the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, which compensates victims of attacks. A fund official has determined there are insufficient assets for a round of payments next year to the nearly 16,000 Americans.

BEIJING, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China will strengthen the coordination of various policies to boost growth and meet this year's economic target, according to a cabinet meeting cited by state media on Wednesday.

The meeting held on Wednesday comes amid China's mounting economic woes with a prolonged property crisis, deflationary pressure and slower growth in retail sales and industrial output.

Tuesday's grim data has raised calls from China watchers for authorities to roll out major fiscal stimulus to get the economy back on more solid footing.

Without giving details, the cabinet meeting chaired by premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies for boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Economists see a downside trend for the world's second-biggest economy. Barclays was among a number of global banks to cut its forecasts for China's 2023 growth after weak activity data.

Beijing pledged to boost the household consumption share of GDP to prop up economic growth as debt-fuelled investment in infrastructure and property has peaked and exports slumped due to weakening global demand.

However, despite a slew of policy announcements about how to boost growth, without direct stimulus such as consumer vouchers and tax cuts, Chinese households have continued to build up savings and reduce borrowing - meaning demand remains sluggish.

""Prolonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well,"" said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank.

""In such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year's growth target of around 5%.""

Lahaina wildfire insured property loss to be about $3.2 bln - KCC,"The damage at the Ho'Onanea condominium complex is seen in the aftermath of a wildfire, in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, U.S. August 10, 2023. REUTERS/Jorge Garcia Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Insured property losses from the wildfire that ravaged the resort town of Lahaina in Hawaii last week are estimated to be about $3.2 billion, catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Company (KCC) said on Wednesday.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The fire charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours and has brought with it the logistical challenges of recovery, taking a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

More than 2,200 structures fall within the fire perimeter, KCC estimated, citing an independent geospatial analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

The majority of damaged structures were residential buildings, though many commercial buildings were affected as well, KCC said, adding that the disaster was the most destructive wildfire in Hawaii history.

The high proportion of wood frame and older construction present in the Lahaina buildings likely contributed to the damage, it said.

Insurance broker Aon last week said the extreme devastation to homes, businesses and other structures in Lahaina would likely drive economic and insured losses into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Moody's Investors' Service said on Tuesday that estimated insured losses from wildfires on Maui in Hawaii would be at least $1 billion.

The report said large insurers such as State Farm, Tokio Marine (8766.T), Allstate (ALL.N) have exposure in Hawaii, but added the companies are expected to readily absorb the losses as their business in Hawaii is a small fraction of their overall insured portfolios.

"To raise scarce dollars, Egypt looks to pension plans, draft evaders","A security man guards in front of a currency exchange bureau advertisement showing image of the U.S. dollar in Cairo, Egypt January 17, 2023. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

CAIRO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Egypt is offering a minimum $5,000 fee for Egyptians living abroad who wish to clear their military service obligations and a U.S. dollar pension plan also aimed at its citizens abroad, in a series of fresh measures designed to boost foreign currency inflows.

Over the past few months, state-owned banks have begun selling high-interest dollar-denominated bonds, and from May, a new law has granted temporary residence to foreigners who buy property for at least $50,000 or deposit $50,000 in state-owned banks.

Those initiatives follow a 2022 scheme to give Egyptian expatriates tax rebates for paying fees on car imports in hard currency, and other measures to attract foreign currency investments in land and industry.

Egypt has been drawing down its foreign currency assets for the last two years after a foreign borrowing spree, following the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. Remittances, by far Egypt's biggest source of foreign currency inflows, dropped sharply in January to March, compared to the same period in 2022, central bank data shows.

The pension plan lets Egyptians living abroad set up pension funds for a minimum $500 that would guarantee monthly payments in dollars for 10 to 15 years from the age of 50, according to a statement on Monday from the Financial Regulatory Authority.

The government will also raise foreign currency by allowing Egyptians living abroad, who are delinquent in their military service, to make good on their status permanently by paying either $5,000 or 5,000 euros during a one-month window, which started on Monday.

The foreign ministry on Tuesday announced a WhatsApp number and email address for enquiries about the scheme, which it said would be monitored around the clock, and urged applicants to register quickly.

Most Egyptian men between the ages of 19 and 30 are required to serve in the military. Many received temporary exemptions to travel for education, medical treatment or work, but end up remaining abroad. Those who do not comply with the service requirement would not be able to renew their passports.

The government has asked applicants to pay into a specially created account at the Abu Dhabi branch, in the United Arab Emirates, of Egypt's state-owned Banque Misr, which itself is headquartered in Egypt's capital Cairo.

The proposed military amnesty will also be available to men over 30 who fail to complete their service.

In the past, the government has allowed military service exemptions with payment of 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($97), provided the men return to Egypt and appear before a military panel to plead their case, said Mahmoud Salem, an Egyptian analyst living in Berlin. But the pound's value has diminished sharply in recent years.

In 2018, 8.9 million Egyptians lived abroad and 97.1 million in Egypt, according to the most recent figures from the central bank. Since then, the number of Egyptians living in Egypt has risen to 105 million.

Official data shows external debt rose to $165.4 billion by the end of March from under $40 billion in 2015. At least $50 billion in repayments will be due over the next few years, according to the central bank.

Interpreters for German troops in Mali seek Berlin protection as pull-out looms,"BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Interpreters for German forces in Mali have asked Berlin for protection for themselves and their families as the troops prepare to pull out by the end of the year, the defence ministry in Berlin said on Wednesday.

The Bundeswehr has deployed some 1,000 troops in Mali where their main task has been reconnaissance for the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA which is about to withdraw after the junta in Bamako asked them to leave.

The German military says it employs some 60 local staff in Mali in total.

""We are conscious of our duty of care for our local staff and take their subjective feeling of being under threat seriously,"" a spokesperson for the defence ministry said, confirming a Spiegel magazine report that the interpreters had sent a letter to the government.

She added the government had a range of protective measures at its disposal that could be drawn upon in case of a crisis or should local staff be in danger because of their work for the Germans.

A German diplomat told Reuters the foreign ministry was monitoring the security situation in Mali closely, and that each ministry was responsible for the protection of its own staff.

Germany and other Western countries were criticised for leaving thousands of local staff behind in Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power in August 2021, prompting a hurried and chaotic evacuation.

MINUSMA was established in 2013 to support foreign and local troops battling Islamist militants, but in recent months there have been repeated instances of tensions between the Malian authorities and the mission.

Western powers fear that Niger, where the government was overthrown in a coup last month, could go the same way as neighbouring Mali, whose leaders hired mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group to help them fight an insurgency after they overthrew the democratic government three years ago and kicked out French troops.

Lahaina wildfire insured property loss to be about $3.2 bln - KCC,"The damage at the Ho'Onanea condominium complex is seen in the aftermath of a wildfire, in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, U.S. August 10, 2023. REUTERS/Jorge Garcia Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Insured property losses from the wildfire that ravaged the resort town of Lahaina in Hawaii last week are estimated to be about $3.2 billion, catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Company (KCC) said on Wednesday.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The fire charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours and has brought with it the logistical challenges of recovery, taking a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

More than 2,200 structures fall within the fire perimeter, KCC estimated, citing an independent geospatial analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

The majority of damaged structures were residential buildings, though many commercial buildings were affected as well, KCC said, adding that the disaster was the most destructive wildfire in Hawaii history.

The high proportion of wood frame and older construction present in the Lahaina buildings likely contributed to the damage, it said.

Insurance broker Aon last week said the extreme devastation to homes, businesses and other structures in Lahaina would likely drive economic and insured losses into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Moody's Investors' Service said on Tuesday that estimated insured losses from wildfires on Maui in Hawaii would be at least $1 billion.

The report said large insurers such as State Farm, Tokio Marine (8766.T), Allstate (ALL.N) have exposure in Hawaii, but added the companies are expected to readily absorb the losses as their business in Hawaii is a small fraction of their overall insured portfolios.

CAIRO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Egypt is offering a minimum $5,000 fee for Egyptians living abroad who wish to clear their military service obligations and a U.S. dollar pension plan also aimed at its citizens abroad, in a series of fresh measures designed to boost foreign currency inflows.

Over the past few months, state-owned banks have begun selling high-interest dollar-denominated bonds, and from May, a new law has granted temporary residence to foreigners who buy property for at least $50,000 or deposit $50,000 in state-owned banks.

Those initiatives follow a 2022 scheme to give Egyptian expatriates tax rebates for paying fees on car imports in hard currency, and other measures to attract foreign currency investments in land and industry.

Egypt has been drawing down its foreign currency assets for the last two years after a foreign borrowing spree, following the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. Remittances, by far Egypt's biggest source of foreign currency inflows, dropped sharply in January to March, compared to the same period in 2022, central bank data shows.

The pension plan lets Egyptians living abroad set up pension funds for a minimum $500 that would guarantee monthly payments in dollars for 10 to 15 years from the age of 50, according to a statement on Monday from the Financial Regulatory Authority.

The government will also raise foreign currency by allowing Egyptians living abroad, who are delinquent in their military service, to make good on their status permanently by paying either $5,000 or 5,000 euros during a one-month window, which started on Monday.

The foreign ministry on Tuesday announced a WhatsApp number and email address for enquiries about the scheme, which it said would be monitored around the clock, and urged applicants to register quickly.

Most Egyptian men between the ages of 19 and 30 are required to serve in the military. Many received temporary exemptions to travel for education, medical treatment or work, but end up remaining abroad. Those who do not comply with the service requirement would not be able to renew their passports.

The government has asked applicants to pay into a specially created account at the Abu Dhabi branch, in the United Arab Emirates, of Egypt's state-owned Banque Misr, which itself is headquartered in Egypt's capital Cairo.

The proposed military amnesty will also be available to men over 30 who fail to complete their service.

In the past, the government has allowed military service exemptions with payment of 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($97), provided the men return to Egypt and appear before a military panel to plead their case, said Mahmoud Salem, an Egyptian analyst living in Berlin. But the pound's value has diminished sharply in recent years.

In 2018, 8.9 million Egyptians lived abroad and 97.1 million in Egypt, according to the most recent figures from the central bank. Since then, the number of Egyptians living in Egypt has risen to 105 million.

Official data shows external debt rose to $165.4 billion by the end of March from under $40 billion in 2015. At least $50 billion in repayments will be due over the next few years, according to the central bank.

Interpreters for German troops in Mali seek Berlin protection as pull-out looms,"BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Interpreters for German forces in Mali have asked Berlin for protection for themselves and their families as the troops prepare to pull out by the end of the year, the defence ministry in Berlin said on Wednesday.

The Bundeswehr has deployed some 1,000 troops in Mali where their main task has been reconnaissance for the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA which is about to withdraw after the junta in Bamako asked them to leave.

The German military says it employs some 60 local staff in Mali in total.

""We are conscious of our duty of care for our local staff and take their subjective feeling of being under threat seriously,"" a spokesperson for the defence ministry said, confirming a Spiegel magazine report that the interpreters had sent a letter to the government.

She added the government had a range of protective measures at its disposal that could be drawn upon in case of a crisis or should local staff be in danger because of their work for the Germans.

A German diplomat told Reuters the foreign ministry was monitoring the security situation in Mali closely, and that each ministry was responsible for the protection of its own staff.

Germany and other Western countries were criticised for leaving thousands of local staff behind in Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power in August 2021, prompting a hurried and chaotic evacuation.

MINUSMA was established in 2013 to support foreign and local troops battling Islamist militants, but in recent months there have been repeated instances of tensions between the Malian authorities and the mission.

Western powers fear that Niger, where the government was overthrown in a coup last month, could go the same way as neighbouring Mali, whose leaders hired mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group to help them fight an insurgency after they overthrew the democratic government three years ago and kicked out French troops.

UN chief says 'robust use of force' needed against Haiti's gangs,"[1/5] People carry their belongings as they flee their neighbourhood Carrefour Feuilless after gangs took over, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. REUTERS/Ralph Tedy Erol Acquire Licensing Rights

UNITED NATIONS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A ""robust use of force"" by a multinational police deployment and use of military assets is needed to restore law and order in Haiti and disarm gangs, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres told the Security Council in a report seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

Haiti last year asked for international help to combat violent gangs that have largely overrun the capital Port-au-Prince. Guterres suggested in October that countries send a ""rapid action force"" to support Haiti's police.

The council last month encouraged countries to provide security support and asked Guterres to report within 30 days on a full range of U.N. options, including backing for a non-U.N. multinational force or a possible peacekeeping operation.

Guterres's report was circulated to the 15-member council on Tuesday and outlined two potential U.N. options: providing logistical support to a multinational force and Haiti's police and to strengthen a U.N. political mission already in Haiti.

""Haiti's current context is not conducive to peacekeeping,"" Guterres wrote, adding that law and order had to be restored, gangs disarmed, strategic installations and roadways secured and a state presence re-established to provide basic services.

""Nothing short of the robust use of force, complemented by a suite of non-kinetic measures, by a capable specialized multinational police force enabled by military assets, coordinated with the national police, would be able to achieve these objectives,"" said Guterres, who visited Haiti last month.

U.N. peacekeepers were deployed to Haiti in 2004 after a rebellion led to the ouster and exile of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Peacekeeping troops left in 2017 and were replaced by U.N. police, who left in 2019.

Haitians are wary of an armed U.N. presence. The Caribbean country was free of cholera until 2010, when U.N. peacekeepers dumped infected sewage into a river. More than 9,000 people died of the disease, and some 800,000 fell ill.

'ACT NOW' SAYS UN CHIEF

Guterres again appealed for countries to ""act now"" to contribute to the deployment of a non-U.N. multinational force and for the Security Council to support such a move. The United States has already said it is prepared to put forward a draft Security Council resolution to back a deployment.

Countries have been wary of supporting the unelected administration of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who has said fair elections cannot be held with the current insecurity. Haiti has been without any elected representatives since January.

Kenya said last month it was ready to consider leading an international force and pledged to send 1,000 police officers. Kenyan officials are due to travel to Haiti soon to assess the needs for such a deployment. The Bahamas has since committed 150 people if the United Nations authorizes the force.

Guterres said Jamaica had also renewed its pledge to contribute to a force and he also welcomed announcements made by Antigua and Barbuda to consider contributing. He urged member states, particularly in the Americas, ""to continue to build on this new momentum.""

Guterres cited the ""extreme violence"" of gang attacks. ""The capital is encircled by gangs and effectively cut off by road from the northern, southern and eastern parts of the country.""

International security help should include safeguards to prevent abuses, Human Rights Watch said on Monday.

In his report, Guterres said any targeted operations against gangs must also protect people and respect human rights and due process.

Indian government plans stake sale in Indian Railways' funding arm - sources,"NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Indian government is considering selling some of its stake in the state-owned Indian Railway Finance Corp (IRFC) (INID.NS) as it aims to meet its divestment targets for the year, two government officials told Reuters on Wednesday.

The government owns a little over 86% of the Indian Railways' funding arm.

""The stake sale would take place soon,"" a government official said, adding that while the government is yet to decide the exact quantum of sale, it will aim to sell up to 11% in multiple tranches.

Last month, the government sold a more-than-5% stake in another state-run railways company, Rail Vikas Nigam, raising 13.66 billion rupees ($164.34 million).

So far in fiscal 2024, it has raised 56 billion rupees against a target of 510 billion rupees.

The Ministry of Finance did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The sale would also have the added advantage of the government adhering to the regulator-mandated minimum public shareholding norms, which requires that public companies maintain at least 25% public shareholding.

While state-run firms have greater leeway in this regard, the government intends to bring down its shareholding in line with the norms.

Shares of IRFC have gained 58% over the last four weeks. The stock was trading at 51.55 rupees per share at 01.42 p.m. IST on Wednesday, up 1%.

Lawmakers urge Biden to resolve offloading delay of seized Iran oil tanker,"The Houston Ship Channel and adjacent refineries, part of the Port of Houston, are seen in Houston, Texas, U.S., May 5, 2019. REUTERS/Loren Elliott//File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers from both political parties have urged President Joe Biden and members of his administration to resolve a months-long delay in the transfer of a cargo of oil from a seized Iranian tanker off Texas.

The Suez Rajan has been stuck near Galveston about 50 miles (80 km) from Houston since May 30, as shipping companies fear any vessel unloading it would lead other oil buyers to shun their ships on future voyages. The U.S. seized the tanker in a sanctions enforcement operation.

The delay in discharging the cargo is also partly out of fear of repercussions from Iran. A senior commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' navy said last month Iran would retaliate against any oil company unloading Iranian oil from a seized tanker.

Senators Joni Ernst, a Republican, and Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and other lawmakers in the Senate and U.S. House said in the letter to Biden and senior administration officials that enforcement of petroleum sanctions will become irrelevant if American citizens and companies involved constantly live in fear of Iranian retaliation.

""It is imperative that the Administration make clear that Iran and designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations cannot prevent our government from carrying out legitimate law enforcement operations,"" the lawmakers said in the letter sent late on Tuesday and seen by Reuters.

They asked the administration for a briefing on the progress of the transfer of the seized oil from the Suez Rajan to U.S. custody.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The saga of the tanker is occurring as Washington and Tehran seek a deal to free five detained U.S. citizens in exchange for releasing $6 billion in Iranian funds frozen in South Korea. A deal would remove a major irritant between Washington and Tehran, which are at odds on issues from the Iranian nuclear program to Tehran's support for regional Shi'ite militias.

The lawmakers estimated the value of the oil on the 800,000 barrel tanker to be $56 million. U.S. seizures of Iranian oil contribute money to the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, which compensates victims of attacks. A fund official has determined there are insufficient assets for a round of payments next year to the nearly 16,000 Americans.

REUTERS/Florence Lo/Pool/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BEIJING, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China will strengthen the coordination of various policies to boost growth and meet this year's economic target, according to a cabinet meeting cited by state media on Wednesday.

The meeting held on Wednesday comes amid China's mounting economic woes with a prolonged property crisis, deflationary pressure and slower growth in retail sales and industrial output.

Tuesday's grim data has raised calls from China watchers for authorities to roll out major fiscal stimulus to get the economy back on more solid footing.

Without giving details, the cabinet meeting chaired by premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies for boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Economists see a downside trend for the world's second-biggest economy. Barclays was among a number of global banks to cut its forecasts for China's 2023 growth after weak activity data.

Beijing pledged to boost the household consumption share of GDP to prop up economic growth as debt-fuelled investment in infrastructure and property has peaked and exports slumped due to weakening global demand.

However, despite a slew of policy announcements about how to boost growth, without direct stimulus such as consumer vouchers and tax cuts, Chinese households have continued to build up savings and reduce borrowing - meaning demand remains sluggish.

""Prolonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well,"" said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank.

""In such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year's growth target of around 5%.""

BEIJING, Aug 16 - Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that he plans to ask China to take a stronger position on Ukraine and to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war.

""We need China to take a stronger position,"" Rasmussen told Reuters in Shanghai at the start of his three-day visit to China.

""Putin is not listening to European leaders, but is clearly listening to China. So I want to argue that China should speak up,"" he said.

Rasmussen said he will discuss Ukraine and bilateral cooperation on green energy with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi when the two meet on Friday in Beijing. He will also meet Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Thursday.

Denmark is a strong supporter of the Ukraine war effort. In June, it increased its military aid to Ukraine to over $3 billion over the next five years.

""In such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year's growth target of around 5%.""

BEIJING, Aug 16 - Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that he plans to ask China to take a stronger position on Ukraine and to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war.

""We need China to take a stronger position,"" Rasmussen told Reuters in Shanghai at the start of his three-day visit to China.

""Putin is not listening to European leaders, but is clearly listening to China. So I want to argue that China should speak up,"" he said.

Rasmussen said he will discuss Ukraine and bilateral cooperation on green energy with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi when the two meet on Friday in Beijing. He will also meet Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Thursday.

Denmark is a strong supporter of the Ukraine war effort. In June, it increased its military aid to Ukraine to over $3 billion over the next five years.

Lahaina wildfire insured property loss to be about $3.2 bln - KCC,"The damage at the Ho'Onanea condominium complex is seen in the aftermath of a wildfire, in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, U.S. August 10, 2023. REUTERS/Jorge Garcia Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Insured property losses from the wildfire that ravaged the resort town of Lahaina in Hawaii last week are estimated to be about $3.2 billion, catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Company (KCC) said on Wednesday.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The fire charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours and has brought with it the logistical challenges of recovery, taking a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

More than 2,200 structures fall within the fire perimeter, KCC estimated, citing an independent geospatial analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

The majority of damaged structures were residential buildings, though many commercial buildings were affected as well, KCC said, adding that the disaster was the most destructive wildfire in Hawaii history.

The high proportion of wood frame and older construction present in the Lahaina buildings likely contributed to the damage, it said.

Insurance broker Aon last week said the extreme devastation to homes, businesses and other structures in Lahaina would likely drive economic and insured losses into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Moody's Investors' Service said on Tuesday that estimated insured losses from wildfires on Maui in Hawaii would be at least $1 billion.

The report said large insurers such as State Farm, Tokio Marine (8766.T), Allstate (ALL.N) have exposure in Hawaii, but added the companies are expected to readily absorb the losses as their business in Hawaii is a small fraction of their overall insured portfolios.

CAIRO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Egypt is offering a minimum $5,000 fee for Egyptians living abroad who wish to clear their military service obligations and a U.S. dollar pension plan also aimed at its citizens abroad, in a series of fresh measures designed to boost foreign currency inflows.

Over the past few months, state-owned banks have begun selling high-interest dollar-denominated bonds, and from May, a new law has granted temporary residence to foreigners who buy property for at least $50,000 or deposit $50,000 in state-owned banks.

Those initiatives follow a 2022 scheme to give Egyptian expatriates tax rebates for paying fees on car imports in hard currency, and other measures to attract foreign currency investments in land and industry.

Egypt has been drawing down its foreign currency assets for the last two years after a foreign borrowing spree, following the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. Remittances, by far Egypt's biggest source of foreign currency inflows, dropped sharply in January to March, compared to the same period in 2022, central bank data shows.

The pension plan lets Egyptians living abroad set up pension funds for a minimum $500 that would guarantee monthly payments in dollars for 10 to 15 years from the age of 50, according to a statement on Monday from the Financial Regulatory Authority.

The government will also raise foreign currency by allowing Egyptians living abroad, who are delinquent in their military service, to make good on their status permanently by paying either $5,000 or 5,000 euros during a one-month window, which started on Monday.

The foreign ministry on Tuesday announced a WhatsApp number and email address for enquiries about the scheme, which it said would be monitored around the clock, and urged applicants to register quickly.

Most Egyptian men between the ages of 19 and 30 are required to serve in the military. Many received temporary exemptions to travel for education, medical treatment or work, but end up remaining abroad. Those who do not comply with the service requirement would not be able to renew their passports.

The government has asked applicants to pay into a specially created account at the Abu Dhabi branch, in the United Arab Emirates, of Egypt's state-owned Banque Misr, which itself is headquartered in Egypt's capital Cairo.

The proposed military amnesty will also be available to men over 30 who fail to complete their service.

In the past, the government has allowed military service exemptions with payment of 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($97), provided the men return to Egypt and appear before a military panel to plead their case, said Mahmoud Salem, an Egyptian analyst living in Berlin. But the pound's value has diminished sharply in recent years.

In 2018, 8.9 million Egyptians lived abroad and 97.1 million in Egypt, according to the most recent figures from the central bank. Since then, the number of Egyptians living in Egypt has risen to 105 million.

Official data shows external debt rose to $165.4 billion by the end of March from under $40 billion in 2015. At least $50 billion in repayments will be due over the next few years, according to the central bank.

Interpreters for German troops in Mali seek Berlin protection as pull-out looms,"BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Interpreters for German forces in Mali have asked Berlin for protection for themselves and their families as the troops prepare to pull out by the end of the year, the defence ministry in Berlin said on Wednesday.

The Bundeswehr has deployed some 1,000 troops in Mali where their main task has been reconnaissance for the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA which is about to withdraw after the junta in Bamako asked them to leave.

The German military says it employs some 60 local staff in Mali in total.

""We are conscious of our duty of care for our local staff and take their subjective feeling of being under threat seriously,"" a spokesperson for the defence ministry said, confirming a Spiegel magazine report that the interpreters had sent a letter to the government.

She added the government had a range of protective measures at its disposal that could be drawn upon in case of a crisis or should local staff be in danger because of their work for the Germans.

A German diplomat told Reuters the foreign ministry was monitoring the security situation in Mali closely, and that each ministry was responsible for the protection of its own staff.

Germany and other Western countries were criticised for leaving thousands of local staff behind in Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power in August 2021, prompting a hurried and chaotic evacuation.

MINUSMA was established in 2013 to support foreign and local troops battling Islamist militants, but in recent months there have been repeated instances of tensions between the Malian authorities and the mission.

Western powers fear that Niger, where the government was overthrown in a coup last month, could go the same way as neighbouring Mali, whose leaders hired mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group to help them fight an insurgency after they overthrew the democratic government three years ago and kicked out French troops.

UN chief says 'robust use of force' needed against Haiti's gangs,"[1/5] People carry their belongings as they flee their neighbourhood Carrefour Feuilless after gangs took over, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. REUTERS/Ralph Tedy Erol Acquire Licensing Rights

UNITED NATIONS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A ""robust use of force"" by a multinational police deployment and use of military assets is needed to restore law and order in Haiti and disarm gangs, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres told the Security Council in a report seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

Haiti last year asked for international help to combat violent gangs that have largely overrun the capital Port-au-Prince. Guterres suggested in October that countries send a ""rapid action force"" to support Haiti's police.

The council last month encouraged countries to provide security support and asked Guterres to report within 30 days on a full range of U.N. options, including backing for a non-U.N. multinational force or a possible peacekeeping operation.

Guterres's report was circulated to the 15-member council on Tuesday and outlined two potential U.N. options: providing logistical support to a multinational force and Haiti's police and to strengthen a U.N. political mission already in Haiti.

""Haiti's current context is not conducive to peacekeeping,"" Guterres wrote, adding that law and order had to be restored, gangs disarmed, strategic installations and roadways secured and a state presence re-established to provide basic services.

""Nothing short of the robust use of force, complemented by a suite of non-kinetic measures, by a capable specialized multinational police force enabled by military assets, coordinated with the national police, would be able to achieve these objectives,"" said Guterres, who visited Haiti last month.

U.N. peacekeepers were deployed to Haiti in 2004 after a rebellion led to the ouster and exile of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Peacekeeping troops left in 2017 and were replaced by U.N. police, who left in 2019.

Haitians are wary of an armed U.N. presence. The Caribbean country was free of cholera until 2010, when U.N. peacekeepers dumped infected sewage into a river. More than 9,000 people died of the disease, and some 800,000 fell ill.

'ACT NOW' SAYS UN CHIEF

Guterres again appealed for countries to ""act now"" to contribute to the deployment of a non-U.N. multinational force and for the Security Council to support such a move. The United States has already said it is prepared to put forward a draft Security Council resolution to back a deployment.

Countries have been wary of supporting the unelected administration of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who has said fair elections cannot be held with the current insecurity. Haiti has been without any elected representatives since January.

Kenya said last month it was ready to consider leading an international force and pledged to send 1,000 police officers. Kenyan officials are due to travel to Haiti soon to assess the needs for such a deployment. The Bahamas has since committed 150 people if the United Nations authorizes the force.

Guterres said Jamaica had also renewed its pledge to contribute to a force and he also welcomed announcements made by Antigua and Barbuda to consider contributing. He urged member states, particularly in the Americas, ""to continue to build on this new momentum.""

Guterres cited the ""extreme violence"" of gang attacks. ""The capital is encircled by gangs and effectively cut off by road from the northern, southern and eastern parts of the country.""

International security help should include safeguards to prevent abuses, Human Rights Watch said on Monday.

In his report, Guterres said any targeted operations against gangs must also protect people and respect human rights and due process.

Summary

Companies Q2 revenue 287.9 bln yuan vs forecast 278.9 bln yuan

Says more vendors joined, customers shopped more often

Shares fall in early trade

Aug 16 (Reuters) - JD.com (9618.HK), beat analyst forecasts for second-quarter revenue on Wednesday, as the Chinese e-commerce giant's focus on lower-priced products paid off in the fight for customers in an economic slowdown.

The company said it attracted more vendors to its platform, helped by lower thresholds and costs for them to join, and that users shopped more frequently as its product range expanded.

Competition is intense in the commerce sector and rivals such as Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and PDD Holdings Inc (PDD.O) are also trying to host more vendors to boost choice for buyers.

Helped by its so-called ten billion yuan subsidy programme, customers are also logging on to JD.com's platform more often to make purchases, the company said, without providing figures.

CEO Sandy Xu said in some core categories, such as electronics where JD.com is a strong player, the company continued to increase market share in the second quarter despite a weak property market and modest recovery in durable goods demand. ""In fact the electronics category is still facing pressure,"" she said, ""but we outperformed the industry.""

JD.com's second-quarter revenue rose 7.6% to 287.9 billion yuan ($39.7 billion), beating analysts' average estimate of 278.85 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, an e-commerce consulting firm based in Beijing, said JD.com's low price strategy was in tune with consumers' focus emerging from the pandemic, and its strength in service and logistics helped it appeal to higher end urban customers.

""JD.com's low price strategy, coupled with these advantages, has broadened the user base and made the platform a preferred choice over Pinduoduo in the 3C and appliance verticals,"" Cooke said, referring to computer, consumer electronics and communications products.

After China abandoned its stringent COVID-19 lockdown policies, consumption failed to rebound immediately amid a slowdown in the overall economy.

Recent official economic data has also been gloomy, with the consumer price index tipping into deflation in July.

Retail sales rose just 2.5%, slowing from a 3.1% increase in June, despite the summer travel season. Analysts had expected retail sales to grow 4.5%.

U.S.-listed JD.com shares were down almost 5% in early trade.

REUTERS/Florence Lo/Pool/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

BEIJING, Aug 16 (Reuters) - China will strengthen the coordination of various policies to boost growth and meet this year's economic target, according to a cabinet meeting cited by state media on Wednesday.

The meeting held on Wednesday comes amid China's mounting economic woes with a prolonged property crisis, deflationary pressure and slower growth in retail sales and industrial output.

Tuesday's grim data has raised calls from China watchers for authorities to roll out major fiscal stimulus to get the economy back on more solid footing.

Without giving details, the cabinet meeting chaired by premier Li Qiang said China would continue to introduce policies for boosting consumption and promoting investment.

Economists see a downside trend for the world's second-biggest economy. Barclays was among a number of global banks to cut its forecasts for China's 2023 growth after weak activity data.

Beijing pledged to boost the household consumption share of GDP to prop up economic growth as debt-fuelled investment in infrastructure and property has peaked and exports slumped due to weakening global demand.

However, despite a slew of policy announcements about how to boost growth, without direct stimulus such as consumer vouchers and tax cuts, Chinese households have continued to build up savings and reduce borrowing - meaning demand remains sluggish.

""Prolonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well,"" said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank.

""In such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year's growth target of around 5%.""

Retail sales rose just 2.5%, slowing from a 3.1% increase in June, despite the summer travel season. Analysts had expected retail sales to grow 4.5%.

U.S.-listed JD.com shares were down almost 5% in early trade.

"Sudan 'spiralling out of control' as 1 million flee country, UN warns","Summary Number of refugees rises above one million

Residents face attacks, looting, blackouts

Many bodies uncollected or unidentified

Aug 15 (Reuters) - More than 1 million people have fled Sudan to neighbouring states and people inside the country are running out of food and dying due to lack of healthcare after four months of war, the United Nations warned on Tuesday.

Fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated the capital Khartoum and sparked ethnically driven attacks in Darfur, threatening to plunge Sudan into a protracted civil war and destabilise the region.

""Time is running out for farmers to plant the crops that will feed them and their neighbours. Medical supplies are scarce. The situation is spiralling out of control,"" U.N. agencies said in a joint statement.

""At the end of the day, this war will end at a negotiating table,"" said deputy Sovereign Council head Malik Agar, in a potential softening of the army's stance, citing the hardships citizens have endured.

The war has caused 1,017,449 people to cross from Sudan into neighbouring countries, many already struggling with the impact of conflicts or economic crises, while those displaced within Sudan are estimated to number 3,433,025, according to the latest weekly figures published by the IOM.

Fighting erupted on April 15 over tensions linked to a planned transition to civilian rule, exposing civilians in the capital and beyond to daily battles and attacks.

The millions who remain in Khartoum and cities in the Darfur and Kordofan regions have faced rampant looting and long power, communications and water cuts.

""The remains of many of those killed have not been collected, identified or buried,"" but the U.N. estimates that more than 4,000 have been killed, Elizabeth Throssell, spokesperson for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a briefing in Geneva.

Reports of sexual assaults have increased by 50%, said U.N. population fund official Laila Baker.

BLACKOUT

Large swathes of the country have been suffering from an electricity blackout since Sunday that has also taken mobile networks offline, according to a statement from the national electricity authority.

Agar said the circumstances necessitated the formation of a caretaker government to provide services and to rebuild.

Seasonal rains that increase the risk of water-borne diseases have destroyed or damaged the homes of up to 13,500 people, the U.N. estimates.

In a speech on Monday, army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan accused the RSF of aiming ""to take the country back to an era before the modern state"" and ""committing every crime that can be imagined.""

The RSF has accused the army of trying to seize full power under the direction of loyalists of Omar al-Bashir, the autocratic leader who was toppled during a popular uprising in 2019.

Efforts led by Saudi Arabia and the United States to negotiate a ceasefire in the current conflict have stalled, and humanitarian agencies have struggled to provide relief because of insecurity, looting and bureaucratic hurdles.

BEIJING, Aug 16 - Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Wednesday that he plans to ask China to take a stronger position on Ukraine and to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war.

""We need China to take a stronger position,"" Rasmussen told Reuters in Shanghai at the start of his three-day visit to China.

""Putin is not listening to European leaders, but is clearly listening to China. So I want to argue that China should speak up,"" he said.

Rasmussen said he will discuss Ukraine and bilateral cooperation on green energy with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi when the two meet on Friday in Beijing. He will also meet Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Thursday.

Denmark is a strong supporter of the Ukraine war effort. In June, it increased its military aid to Ukraine to over $3 billion over the next five years.

Lahaina wildfire insured property loss to be about $3.2 bln - KCC,"The damage at the Ho'Onanea condominium complex is seen in the aftermath of a wildfire, in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, U.S. August 10, 2023. REUTERS/Jorge Garcia Acquire Licensing Rights

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Insured property losses from the wildfire that ravaged the resort town of Lahaina in Hawaii last week are estimated to be about $3.2 billion, catastrophe modeling firm Karen Clark & Company (KCC) said on Wednesday.

The inferno killed at least 106 people after racing from grasslands outside town into Lahaina last Tuesday.

The fire charred a 5-square-mile (13-square-km) area of town in hours and has brought with it the logistical challenges of recovery, taking a toll on many of Lahaina's 13,000 year-round residents, who are also facing the prospect of precious tourist dollars evaporating.

More than 2,200 structures fall within the fire perimeter, KCC estimated, citing an independent geospatial analysis of satellite and aerial imagery.

The majority of damaged structures were residential buildings, though many commercial buildings were affected as well, KCC said, adding that the disaster was the most destructive wildfire in Hawaii history.

The high proportion of wood frame and older construction present in the Lahaina buildings likely contributed to the damage, it said.

Insurance broker Aon last week said the extreme devastation to homes, businesses and other structures in Lahaina would likely drive economic and insured losses into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Moody's Investors' Service said on Tuesday that estimated insured losses from wildfires on Maui in Hawaii would be at least $1 billion.

The report said large insurers such as State Farm, Tokio Marine (8766.T), Allstate (ALL.N) have exposure in Hawaii, but added the companies are expected to readily absorb the losses as their business in Hawaii is a small fraction of their overall insured portfolios.

"To raise scarce dollars, Egypt looks to pension plans, draft evaders","A security man guards in front of a currency exchange bureau advertisement showing image of the U.S. dollar in Cairo, Egypt January 17, 2023. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

CAIRO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Egypt is offering a minimum $5,000 fee for Egyptians living abroad who wish to clear their military service obligations and a U.S. dollar pension plan also aimed at its citizens abroad, in a series of fresh measures designed to boost foreign currency inflows.

Over the past few months, state-owned banks have begun selling high-interest dollar-denominated bonds, and from May, a new law has granted temporary residence to foreigners who buy property for at least $50,000 or deposit $50,000 in state-owned banks.

Those initiatives follow a 2022 scheme to give Egyptian expatriates tax rebates for paying fees on car imports in hard currency, and other measures to attract foreign currency investments in land and industry.

Egypt has been drawing down its foreign currency assets for the last two years after a foreign borrowing spree, following the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. Remittances, by far Egypt's biggest source of foreign currency inflows, dropped sharply in January to March, compared to the same period in 2022, central bank data shows.

The pension plan lets Egyptians living abroad set up pension funds for a minimum $500 that would guarantee monthly payments in dollars for 10 to 15 years from the age of 50, according to a statement on Monday from the Financial Regulatory Authority.

The government will also raise foreign currency by allowing Egyptians living abroad, who are delinquent in their military service, to make good on their status permanently by paying either $5,000 or 5,000 euros during a one-month window, which started on Monday.

The foreign ministry on Tuesday announced a WhatsApp number and email address for enquiries about the scheme, which it said would be monitored around the clock, and urged applicants to register quickly.

Most Egyptian men between the ages of 19 and 30 are required to serve in the military. Many received temporary exemptions to travel for education, medical treatment or work, but end up remaining abroad. Those who do not comply with the service requirement would not be able to renew their passports.

The government has asked applicants to pay into a specially created account at the Abu Dhabi branch, in the United Arab Emirates, of Egypt's state-owned Banque Misr, which itself is headquartered in Egypt's capital Cairo.

The proposed military amnesty will also be available to men over 30 who fail to complete their service.

In the past, the government has allowed military service exemptions with payment of 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($97), provided the men return to Egypt and appear before a military panel to plead their case, said Mahmoud Salem, an Egyptian analyst living in Berlin. But the pound's value has diminished sharply in recent years.

In 2018, 8.9 million Egyptians lived abroad and 97.1 million in Egypt, according to the most recent figures from the central bank. Since then, the number of Egyptians living in Egypt has risen to 105 million.

Official data shows external debt rose to $165.4 billion by the end of March from under $40 billion in 2015. At least $50 billion in repayments will be due over the next few years, according to the central bank.

Interpreters for German troops in Mali seek Berlin protection as pull-out looms,"BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Interpreters for German forces in Mali have asked Berlin for protection for themselves and their families as the troops prepare to pull out by the end of the year, the defence ministry in Berlin said on Wednesday.

The Bundeswehr has deployed some 1,000 troops in Mali where their main task has been reconnaissance for the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA which is about to withdraw after the junta in Bamako asked them to leave.

The German military says it employs some 60 local staff in Mali in total.

""We are conscious of our duty of care for our local staff and take their subjective feeling of being under threat seriously,"" a spokesperson for the defence ministry said, confirming a Spiegel magazine report that the interpreters had sent a letter to the government.

She added the government had a range of protective measures at its disposal that could be drawn upon in case of a crisis or should local staff be in danger because of their work for the Germans.

A German diplomat told Reuters the foreign ministry was monitoring the security situation in Mali closely, and that each ministry was responsible for the protection of its own staff.

Germany and other Western countries were criticised for leaving thousands of local staff behind in Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power in August 2021, prompting a hurried and chaotic evacuation.

MINUSMA was established in 2013 to support foreign and local troops battling Islamist militants, but in recent months there have been repeated instances of tensions between the Malian authorities and the mission.

Western powers fear that Niger, where the government was overthrown in a coup last month, could go the same way as neighbouring Mali, whose leaders hired mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group to help them fight an insurgency after they overthrew the democratic government three years ago and kicked out French troops.

UNITED NATIONS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A ""robust use of force"" by a multinational police deployment and use of military assets is needed to restore law and order in Haiti and disarm gangs, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres told the Security Council in a report seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

Haiti last year asked for international help to combat violent gangs that have largely overrun the capital Port-au-Prince. Guterres suggested in October that countries send a ""rapid action force"" to support Haiti's police.

The council last month encouraged countries to provide security support and asked Guterres to report within 30 days on a full range of U.N. options, including backing for a non-U.N. multinational force or a possible peacekeeping operation.

Guterres's report was circulated to the 15-member council on Tuesday and outlined two potential U.N. options: providing logistical support to a multinational force and Haiti's police and to strengthen a U.N. political mission already in Haiti.

""Haiti's current context is not conducive to peacekeeping,"" Guterres wrote, adding that law and order had to be restored, gangs disarmed, strategic installations and roadways secured and a state presence re-established to provide basic services.

""Nothing short of the robust use of force, complemented by a suite of non-kinetic measures, by a capable specialized multinational police force enabled by military assets, coordinated with the national police, would be able to achieve these objectives,"" said Guterres, who visited Haiti last month.

U.N. peacekeepers were deployed to Haiti in 2004 after a rebellion led to the ouster and exile of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Peacekeeping troops left in 2017 and were replaced by U.N. police, who left in 2019.

Haitians are wary of an armed U.N. presence. The Caribbean country was free of cholera until 2010, when U.N. peacekeepers dumped infected sewage into a river. More than 9,000 people died of the disease, and some 800,000 fell ill.

'ACT NOW' SAYS UN CHIEF

Guterres again appealed for countries to ""act now"" to contribute to the deployment of a non-U.N. multinational force and for the Security Council to support such a move. The United States has already said it is prepared to put forward a draft Security Council resolution to back a deployment.

Countries have been wary of supporting the unelected administration of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who has said fair elections cannot be held with the current insecurity. Haiti has been without any elected representatives since January.

Kenya said last month it was ready to consider leading an international force and pledged to send 1,000 police officers. Kenyan officials are due to travel to Haiti soon to assess the needs for such a deployment. The Bahamas has since committed 150 people if the United Nations authorizes the force.

Guterres said Jamaica had also renewed its pledge to contribute to a force and he also welcomed announcements made by Antigua and Barbuda to consider contributing. He urged member states, particularly in the Americas, ""to continue to build on this new momentum.""

Guterres cited the ""extreme violence"" of gang attacks. ""The capital is encircled by gangs and effectively cut off by road from the northern, southern and eastern parts of the country.""

International security help should include safeguards to prevent abuses, Human Rights Watch said on Monday.

In his report, Guterres said any targeted operations against gangs must also protect people and respect human rights and due process.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts slipped by 10% in July compared with the previous month, which had produced the strongest figures in ten years, data from the national housing agency showed on Wednesday.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts fell to 254,966 units in July from a revised 283,498 units in June, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) said.

Economists in a Reuters poll had expected starts to fall to 240,000 in July.

Summary

Companies Q2 revenue 287.9 bln yuan vs forecast 278.9 bln yuan

Says more vendors joined, customers shopped more often

Shares fall in early trade

Aug 16 (Reuters) - JD.com (9618.HK), beat analyst forecasts for second-quarter revenue on Wednesday, as the Chinese e-commerce giant's focus on lower-priced products paid off in the fight for customers in an economic slowdown.

The company said it attracted more vendors to its platform, helped by lower thresholds and costs for them to join, and that users shopped more frequently as its product range expanded.

Competition is intense in the commerce sector and rivals such as Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and PDD Holdings Inc (PDD.O) are also trying to host more vendors to boost choice for buyers.

Helped by its so-called ten billion yuan subsidy programme, customers are also logging on to JD.com's platform more often to make purchases, the company said, without providing figures.

CEO Sandy Xu said in some core categories, such as electronics where JD.com is a strong player, the company continued to increase market share in the second quarter despite a weak property market and modest recovery in durable goods demand. ""In fact the electronics category is still facing pressure,"" she said, ""but we outperformed the industry.""

JD.com's second-quarter revenue rose 7.6% to 287.9 billion yuan ($39.7 billion), beating analysts' average estimate of 278.85 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, an e-commerce consulting firm based in Beijing, said JD.com's low price strategy was in tune with consumers' focus emerging from the pandemic, and its strength in service and logistics helped it appeal to higher end urban customers.

""JD.com's low price strategy, coupled with these advantages, has broadened the user base and made the platform a preferred choice over Pinduoduo in the 3C and appliance verticals,"" Cooke said, referring to computer, consumer electronics and communications products.

After China abandoned its stringent COVID-19 lockdown policies, consumption failed to rebound immediately amid a slowdown in the overall economy.

Recent official economic data has also been gloomy, with the consumer price index tipping into deflation in July.

Retail sales rose just 2.5%, slowing from a 3.1% increase in June, despite the summer travel season. Analysts had expected retail sales to grow 4.5%.

U.S.-listed JD.com shares were down almost 5% in early trade.

Aug 15 (Reuters) - More than 1 million people have fled Sudan to neighbouring states and people inside the country are running out of food and dying due to lack of healthcare after four months of war, the United Nations warned on Tuesday.

Fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated the capital Khartoum and sparked ethnically driven attacks in Darfur, threatening to plunge Sudan into a protracted civil war and destabilise the region.

CAIRO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Egypt is offering a minimum $5,000 fee for Egyptians living abroad who wish to clear their military service obligations and a U.S. dollar pension plan also aimed at its citizens abroad, in a series of fresh measures designed to boost foreign currency inflows.

Kenya said last month it was ready to consider leading an international force and pledged to send 1,000 police officers. Kenyan officials are due to travel to Haiti soon to assess the needs for such a deployment. The Bahamas has since committed 150 people if the United Nations authorizes the force.

Guterres said Jamaica had also renewed its pledge to contribute to a force and he also welcomed announcements made by Antigua and Barbuda to consider contributing. He urged member states, particularly in the Americas, ""to continue to build on this new momentum.""

Guterres cited the ""extreme violence"" of gang attacks. ""The capital is encircled by gangs and effectively cut off by road from the northern, southern and eastern parts of the country.""

International security help should include safeguards to prevent abuses, Human Rights Watch said on Monday.

In his report, Guterres said any targeted operations against gangs must also protect people and respect human rights and due process.

Summary

Companies Q2 revenue 287.9 bln yuan vs forecast 278.9 bln yuan

Says more vendors joined, customers shopped more often

Shares fall in early trade

Aug 16 (Reuters) - JD.com (9618.HK), beat analyst forecasts for second-quarter revenue on Wednesday, as the Chinese e-commerce giant's focus on lower-priced products paid off in the fight for customers in an economic slowdown.

The company said it attracted more vendors to its platform, helped by lower thresholds and costs for them to join, and that users shopped more frequently as its product range expanded.

Competition is intense in the commerce sector and rivals such as Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and PDD Holdings Inc (PDD.O) are also trying to host more vendors to boost choice for buyers.

Helped by its so-called ten billion yuan subsidy programme, customers are also logging on to JD.com's platform more often to make purchases, the company said, without providing figures.

CEO Sandy Xu said in some core categories, such as electronics where JD.com is a strong player, the company continued to increase market share in the second quarter despite a weak property market and modest recovery in durable goods demand. ""In fact the electronics category is still facing pressure,"" she said, ""but we outperformed the industry.""

JD.com's second-quarter revenue rose 7.6% to 287.9 billion yuan ($39.7 billion), beating analysts' average estimate of 278.85 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, an e-commerce consulting firm based in Beijing, said JD.com's low price strategy was in tune with consumers' focus emerging from the pandemic, and its strength in service and logistics helped it appeal to higher end urban customers.

""JD.com's low price strategy, coupled with these advantages, has broadened the user base and made the platform a preferred choice over Pinduoduo in the 3C and appliance verticals,"" Cooke said, referring to computer, consumer electronics and communications products.

After China abandoned its stringent COVID-19 lockdown policies, consumption failed to rebound immediately amid a slowdown in the overall economy.

Recent official economic data has also been gloomy, with the consumer price index tipping into deflation in July.

Retail sales rose just 2.5%, slowing from a 3.1% increase in June, despite the summer travel season. Analysts had expected retail sales to grow 4.5%.

U.S.-listed JD.com shares were down almost 5% in early trade.

"Sudan 'spiralling out of control' as 1 million flee country, UN warns","Summary Number of refugees rises above one million

Residents face attacks, looting, blackouts

Many bodies uncollected or unidentified

Aug 15 (Reuters) - More than 1 million people have fled Sudan to neighbouring states and people inside the country are running out of food and dying due to lack of healthcare after four months of war, the United Nations warned on Tuesday.

Fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated the capital Khartoum and sparked ethnically driven attacks in Darfur, threatening to plunge Sudan into a protracted civil war and destabilise the region.

""Time is running out for farmers to plant the crops that will feed them and their neighbours. Medical supplies are scarce. The situation is spiralling out of control,"" U.N. agencies said in a joint statement.

""At the end of the day, this war will end at a negotiating table,"" said deputy Sovereign Council head Malik Agar, in a potential softening of the army's stance, citing the hardships citizens have endured.

The war has caused 1,017,449 people to cross from Sudan into neighbouring countries, many already struggling with the impact of conflicts or economic crises, while those displaced within Sudan are estimated to number 3,433,025, according to the latest weekly figures published by the IOM.

Fighting erupted on April 15 over tensions linked to a planned transition to civilian rule, exposing civilians in the capital and beyond to daily battles and attacks.

The millions who remain in Khartoum and cities in the Darfur and Kordofan regions have faced rampant looting and long power, communications and water cuts.

""The remains of many of those killed have not been collected, identified or buried,"" but the U.N. estimates that more than 4,000 have been killed, Elizabeth Throssell, spokesperson for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a briefing in Geneva.

Reports of sexual assaults have increased by 50%, said U.N. population fund official Laila Baker.

BLACKOUT

Large swathes of the country have been suffering from an electricity blackout since Sunday that has also taken mobile networks offline, according to a statement from the national electricity authority.

Agar said the circumstances necessitated the formation of a caretaker government to provide services and to rebuild.

Seasonal rains that increase the risk of water-borne diseases have destroyed or damaged the homes of up to 13,500 people, the U.N. estimates.

In a speech on Monday, army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan accused the RSF of aiming ""to take the country back to an era before the modern state"" and ""committing every crime that can be imagined.""

The RSF has accused the army of trying to seize full power under the direction of loyalists of Omar al-Bashir, the autocratic leader who was toppled during a popular uprising in 2019.

Efforts led by Saudi Arabia and the United States to negotiate a ceasefire in the current conflict have stalled, and humanitarian agencies have struggled to provide relief because of insecurity, looting and bureaucratic hurdles.

Latvia sends army to guard border with Belarus as illegal crossing attempts mount,"Latvian special unit Border Guard officer patrols along the fence at Latvia-Belarus border near Robeznieki, Latvia August 8, 2023. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

VILNIUS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the Baltic country's border with Russian ally Belarus on Tuesday, after 96 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross in 24 hours.

Border Guard officers have also been recalled from their holidays to help with patrols.

Latvia has ""information about a possible increase in hybrid threats"", the Border Guard said in a statement. Belarusian authorities were increasingly involved in organising the flow of illegal immigrants, it said.

EU members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which share a border with Belarus, have worried increasingly about border crossings since hundreds of Russian battle-hardened Wagner mercenaries arrived Belarus last month at the invitation of President Alexander Lukashenko.

Lukashenko has said several times that he has been restraining Wagner fighters who want to attack Poland.

Poland has also seen an increase in the number of mainly Middle Eastern and African migrants trying to cross the border in recent months.

Poland is planning to move up to 10,000 additional troops to the border with Belarus to support the Border Guard, Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Thursday.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, sought to cross into Poland from Belarus but were pushed back.

"To raise scarce dollars, Egypt looks to pension plans, draft evaders","A security man guards in front of a currency exchange bureau advertisement showing image of the U.S. dollar in Cairo, Egypt January 17, 2023. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

CAIRO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Egypt is offering a minimum $5,000 fee for Egyptians living abroad who wish to clear their military service obligations and a U.S. dollar pension plan also aimed at its citizens abroad, in a series of fresh measures designed to boost foreign currency inflows.

Over the past few months, state-owned banks have begun selling high-interest dollar-denominated bonds, and from May, a new law has granted temporary residence to foreigners who buy property for at least $50,000 or deposit $50,000 in state-owned banks.

Those initiatives follow a 2022 scheme to give Egyptian expatriates tax rebates for paying fees on car imports in hard currency, and other measures to attract foreign currency investments in land and industry.

Egypt has been drawing down its foreign currency assets for the last two years after a foreign borrowing spree, following the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and the Ukraine crisis. Remittances, by far Egypt's biggest source of foreign currency inflows, dropped sharply in January to March, compared to the same period in 2022, central bank data shows.

The pension plan lets Egyptians living abroad set up pension funds for a minimum $500 that would guarantee monthly payments in dollars for 10 to 15 years from the age of 50, according to a statement on Monday from the Financial Regulatory Authority.

The government will also raise foreign currency by allowing Egyptians living abroad, who are delinquent in their military service, to make good on their status permanently by paying either $5,000 or 5,000 euros during a one-month window, which started on Monday.

The foreign ministry on Tuesday announced a WhatsApp number and email address for enquiries about the scheme, which it said would be monitored around the clock, and urged applicants to register quickly.

Most Egyptian men between the ages of 19 and 30 are required to serve in the military. Many received temporary exemptions to travel for education, medical treatment or work, but end up remaining abroad. Those who do not comply with the service requirement would not be able to renew their passports.

The government has asked applicants to pay into a specially created account at the Abu Dhabi branch, in the United Arab Emirates, of Egypt's state-owned Banque Misr, which itself is headquartered in Egypt's capital Cairo.

The proposed military amnesty will also be available to men over 30 who fail to complete their service.

In the past, the government has allowed military service exemptions with payment of 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($97), provided the men return to Egypt and appear before a military panel to plead their case, said Mahmoud Salem, an Egyptian analyst living in Berlin. But the pound's value has diminished sharply in recent years.

In 2018, 8.9 million Egyptians lived abroad and 97.1 million in Egypt, according to the most recent figures from the central bank. Since then, the number of Egyptians living in Egypt has risen to 105 million.

Official data shows external debt rose to $165.4 billion by the end of March from under $40 billion in 2015. At least $50 billion in repayments will be due over the next few years, according to the central bank.

Interpreters for German troops in Mali seek Berlin protection as pull-out looms,"BERLIN, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Interpreters for German forces in Mali have asked Berlin for protection for themselves and their families as the troops prepare to pull out by the end of the year, the defence ministry in Berlin said on Wednesday.

The Bundeswehr has deployed some 1,000 troops in Mali where their main task has been reconnaissance for the 13,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission MINUSMA which is about to withdraw after the junta in Bamako asked them to leave.

The German military says it employs some 60 local staff in Mali in total.

""We are conscious of our duty of care for our local staff and take their subjective feeling of being under threat seriously,"" a spokesperson for the defence ministry said, confirming a Spiegel magazine report that the interpreters had sent a letter to the government.

She added the government had a range of protective measures at its disposal that could be drawn upon in case of a crisis or should local staff be in danger because of their work for the Germans.

A German diplomat told Reuters the foreign ministry was monitoring the security situation in Mali closely, and that each ministry was responsible for the protection of its own staff.

Germany and other Western countries were criticised for leaving thousands of local staff behind in Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power in August 2021, prompting a hurried and chaotic evacuation.

MINUSMA was established in 2013 to support foreign and local troops battling Islamist militants, but in recent months there have been repeated instances of tensions between the Malian authorities and the mission.

Western powers fear that Niger, where the government was overthrown in a coup last month, could go the same way as neighbouring Mali, whose leaders hired mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group to help them fight an insurgency after they overthrew the democratic government three years ago and kicked out French troops.

UN chief says 'robust use of force' needed against Haiti's gangs,"[1/5] People carry their belongings as they flee their neighbourhood Carrefour Feuilless after gangs took over, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. REUTERS/Ralph Tedy Erol Acquire Licensing Rights

UNITED NATIONS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A ""robust use of force"" by a multinational police deployment and use of military assets is needed to restore law and order in Haiti and disarm gangs, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres told the Security Council in a report seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

Haiti last year asked for international help to combat violent gangs that have largely overrun the capital Port-au-Prince. Guterres suggested in October that countries send a ""rapid action force"" to support Haiti's police.

The council last month encouraged countries to provide security support and asked Guterres to report within 30 days on a full range of U.N. options, including backing for a non-U.N. multinational force or a possible peacekeeping operation.

Guterres's report was circulated to the 15-member council on Tuesday and outlined two potential U.N. options: providing logistical support to a multinational force and Haiti's police and to strengthen a U.N. political mission already in Haiti.

""Haiti's current context is not conducive to peacekeeping,"" Guterres wrote, adding that law and order had to be restored, gangs disarmed, strategic installations and roadways secured and a state presence re-established to provide basic services.

""Nothing short of the robust use of force, complemented by a suite of non-kinetic measures, by a capable specialized multinational police force enabled by military assets, coordinated with the national police, would be able to achieve these objectives,"" said Guterres, who visited Haiti last month.

U.N. peacekeepers were deployed to Haiti in 2004 after a rebellion led to the ouster and exile of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Peacekeeping troops left in 2017 and were replaced by U.N. police, who left in 2019.

Haitians are wary of an armed U.N. presence. The Caribbean country was free of cholera until 2010, when U.N. peacekeepers dumped infected sewage into a river. More than 9,000 people died of the disease, and some 800,000 fell ill.

'ACT NOW' SAYS UN CHIEF

Guterres again appealed for countries to ""act now"" to contribute to the deployment of a non-U.N. multinational force and for the Security Council to support such a move. The United States has already said it is prepared to put forward a draft Security Council resolution to back a deployment.

Countries have been wary of supporting the unelected administration of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who has said fair elections cannot be held with the current insecurity. Haiti has been without any elected representatives since January.

Kenya said last month it was ready to consider leading an international force and pledged to send 1,000 police officers. Kenyan officials are due to travel to Haiti soon to assess the needs for such a deployment. The Bahamas has since committed 150 people if the United Nations authorizes the force.

Guterres said Jamaica had also renewed its pledge to contribute to a force and he also welcomed announcements made by Antigua and Barbuda to consider contributing. He urged member states, particularly in the Americas, ""to continue to build on this new momentum.""

Guterres cited the ""extreme violence"" of gang attacks. ""The capital is encircled by gangs and effectively cut off by road from the northern, southern and eastern parts of the country.""

International security help should include safeguards to prevent abuses, Human Rights Watch said on Monday.

In his report, Guterres said any targeted operations against gangs must also protect people and respect human rights and due process.

Summary Around 500,000 T of Vietnamese rice prices renegotiated

Buyers pay $30-$80/T more for Vietnamese fragrant rice

Rising prices threaten consumers with food price inflation

SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Vietnamese exporters have renegotiated higher prices for around half a million metric tons of rice, two trade sources said, as global prices climbed to 15-year highs following India's ban on overseas sales last month.

This is the first confirmation of rice prices climbing in the wake of India's surprise ban, with importers paying more for one of the world's most widely consumed staples amid tightening supplies.

Asian rice exporters had raised offered prices by around 20% since India banned non-basmati white rice exports last month, heightening food inflation risks for some of the most vulnerable consumers in Asia and Africa who are already struggling with lower supplies due to erratic weather and the war in Ukraine.

""Buyers have agreed to pay higher prices for some of (the) cargoes which they bought for August shipment,"" said one trader at an international trading company. He added that around 200,000 tons of rice have been shipped this month while 300,000 tons were yet to be loaded at Vietnamese ports.

Importers, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have paid between $30 and $80 a ton above deals signed at around $550 a ton for fragrant Vietnamese rice before India banned white rice exports in July, the Singapore-based traders said.

This gives sellers additional income of around $15 million to $40 million compared with prices agreed before India's curbs.

The export ban by India, which accounts for 40% of world rice supplies, has taken out 10 million tons of supplies from the international market.

""Renegotiations were primarily carried out for non-basmati white rice,"" said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading house.

""Both buyers and sellers absorbed a portion of the price increase due to the jump in local rice prices. Sellers did not raise prices to match the current market price.""

Fragrant rice from Vietnam was being offered at as high as $700 a ton but prices were renegotiated around $580-$630 a ton, traders said.

Thailand's 5% broken rice prices are being offered at $650-$655 per ton, while the similar variety from Vietnam is offered at $620-$630 per ton.

Thai rice prices were quoted at $545 per ton and Vietnam at $515-$525 per ton before India decided to curb exports in July.

UNITED NATIONS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A ""robust use of force"" by a multinational police deployment and use of military assets is needed to restore law and order in Haiti and disarm gangs, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres told the Security Council in a report seen by Reuters on Tuesday.

Haiti last year asked for international help to combat violent gangs that have largely overrun the capital Port-au-Prince. Guterres suggested in October that countries send a ""rapid action force"" to support Haiti's police.

The council last month encouraged countries to provide security support and asked Guterres to report within 30 days on a full range of U.N. options, including backing for a non-U.N. multinational force or a possible peacekeeping operation.

Guterres's report was circulated to the 15-member council on Tuesday and outlined two potential U.N. options: providing logistical support to a multinational force and Haiti's police and to strengthen a U.N. political mission already in Haiti.

""Haiti's current context is not conducive to peacekeeping,"" Guterres wrote, adding that law and order had to be restored, gangs disarmed, strategic installations and roadways secured and a state presence re-established to provide basic services.

""Nothing short of the robust use of force, complemented by a suite of non-kinetic measures, by a capable specialized multinational police force enabled by military assets, coordinated with the national police, would be able to achieve these objectives,"" said Guterres, who visited Haiti last month.

U.N. peacekeepers were deployed to Haiti in 2004 after a rebellion led to the ouster and exile of then-President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Peacekeeping troops left in 2017 and were replaced by U.N. police, who left in 2019.

Haitians are wary of an armed U.N. presence. The Caribbean country was free of cholera until 2010, when U.N. peacekeepers dumped infected sewage into a river. More than 9,000 people died of the disease, and some 800,000 fell ill.

'ACT NOW' SAYS UN CHIEF

Guterres again appealed for countries to ""act now"" to contribute to the deployment of a non-U.N. multinational force and for the Security Council to support such a move. The United States has already said it is prepared to put forward a draft Security Council resolution to back a deployment.

Countries have been wary of supporting the unelected administration of Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who has said fair elections cannot be held with the current insecurity. Haiti has been without any elected representatives since January.

Kenya said last month it was ready to consider leading an international force and pledged to send 1,000 police officers. Kenyan officials are due to travel to Haiti soon to assess the needs for such a deployment. The Bahamas has since committed 150 people if the United Nations authorizes the force.

Guterres said Jamaica had also renewed its pledge to contribute to a force and he also welcomed announcements made by Antigua and Barbuda to consider contributing. He urged member states, particularly in the Americas, ""to continue to build on this new momentum.""

Guterres cited the ""extreme violence"" of gang attacks. ""The capital is encircled by gangs and effectively cut off by road from the northern, southern and eastern parts of the country.""

International security help should include safeguards to prevent abuses, Human Rights Watch said on Monday.

In his report, Guterres said any targeted operations against gangs must also protect people and respect human rights and due process.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts slipped by 10% in July compared with the previous month, which had produced the strongest figures in ten years, data from the national housing agency showed on Wednesday.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts fell to 254,966 units in July from a revised 283,498 units in June, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) said.

Economists in a Reuters poll had expected starts to fall to 240,000 in July.

Summary

Companies Q2 revenue 287.9 bln yuan vs forecast 278.9 bln yuan

Says more vendors joined, customers shopped more often

Shares fall in early trade

Aug 16 (Reuters) - JD.com (9618.HK), beat analyst forecasts for second-quarter revenue on Wednesday, as the Chinese e-commerce giant's focus on lower-priced products paid off in the fight for customers in an economic slowdown.

The company said it attracted more vendors to its platform, helped by lower thresholds and costs for them to join, and that users shopped more frequently as its product range expanded.

Competition is intense in the commerce sector and rivals such as Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and PDD Holdings Inc (PDD.O) are also trying to host more vendors to boost choice for buyers.

Helped by its so-called ten billion yuan subsidy programme, customers are also logging on to JD.com's platform more often to make purchases, the company said, without providing figures.

CEO Sandy Xu said in some core categories, such as electronics where JD.com is a strong player, the company continued to increase market share in the second quarter despite a weak property market and modest recovery in durable goods demand. ""In fact the electronics category is still facing pressure,"" she said, ""but we outperformed the industry.""

JD.com's second-quarter revenue rose 7.6% to 287.9 billion yuan ($39.7 billion), beating analysts' average estimate of 278.85 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, an e-commerce consulting firm based in Beijing, said JD.com's low price strategy was in tune with consumers' focus emerging from the pandemic, and its strength in service and logistics helped it appeal to higher end urban customers.

""JD.com's low price strategy, coupled with these advantages, has broadened the user base and made the platform a preferred choice over Pinduoduo in the 3C and appliance verticals,"" Cooke said, referring to computer, consumer electronics and communications products.

After China abandoned its stringent COVID-19 lockdown policies, consumption failed to rebound immediately amid a slowdown in the overall economy.

Recent official economic data has also been gloomy, with the consumer price index tipping into deflation in July.

Retail sales rose just 2.5%, slowing from a 3.1% increase in June, despite the summer travel season. Analysts had expected retail sales to grow 4.5%.

U.S.-listed JD.com shares were down almost 5% in early trade.

"Sudan 'spiralling out of control' as 1 million flee country, UN warns","Summary Number of refugees rises above one million

Residents face attacks, looting, blackouts

Many bodies uncollected or unidentified

Aug 15 (Reuters) - More than 1 million people have fled Sudan to neighbouring states and people inside the country are running out of food and dying due to lack of healthcare after four months of war, the United Nations warned on Tuesday.

Fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated the capital Khartoum and sparked ethnically driven attacks in Darfur, threatening to plunge Sudan into a protracted civil war and destabilise the region.

""Time is running out for farmers to plant the crops that will feed them and their neighbours. Medical supplies are scarce. The situation is spiralling out of control,"" U.N. agencies said in a joint statement.

""At the end of the day, this war will end at a negotiating table,"" said deputy Sovereign Council head Malik Agar, in a potential softening of the army's stance, citing the hardships citizens have endured.

The war has caused 1,017,449 people to cross from Sudan into neighbouring countries, many already struggling with the impact of conflicts or economic crises, while those displaced within Sudan are estimated to number 3,433,025, according to the latest weekly figures published by the IOM.

Fighting erupted on April 15 over tensions linked to a planned transition to civilian rule, exposing civilians in the capital and beyond to daily battles and attacks.

The millions who remain in Khartoum and cities in the Darfur and Kordofan regions have faced rampant looting and long power, communications and water cuts.

""The remains of many of those killed have not been collected, identified or buried,"" but the U.N. estimates that more than 4,000 have been killed, Elizabeth Throssell, spokesperson for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a briefing in Geneva.

Reports of sexual assaults have increased by 50%, said U.N. population fund official Laila Baker.

BLACKOUT

Large swathes of the country have been suffering from an electricity blackout since Sunday that has also taken mobile networks offline, according to a statement from the national electricity authority.

Agar said the circumstances necessitated the formation of a caretaker government to provide services and to rebuild.

Seasonal rains that increase the risk of water-borne diseases have destroyed or damaged the homes of up to 13,500 people, the U.N. estimates.

In a speech on Monday, army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan accused the RSF of aiming ""to take the country back to an era before the modern state"" and ""committing every crime that can be imagined.""

The RSF has accused the army of trying to seize full power under the direction of loyalists of Omar al-Bashir, the autocratic leader who was toppled during a popular uprising in 2019.

Efforts led by Saudi Arabia and the United States to negotiate a ceasefire in the current conflict have stalled, and humanitarian agencies have struggled to provide relief because of insecurity, looting and bureaucratic hurdles.

Latvia sends army to guard border with Belarus as illegal crossing attempts mount,"Latvian special unit Border Guard officer patrols along the fence at Latvia-Belarus border near Robeznieki, Latvia August 8, 2023. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

VILNIUS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the Baltic country's border with Russian ally Belarus on Tuesday, after 96 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross in 24 hours.

Border Guard officers have also been recalled from their holidays to help with patrols.

Latvia has ""information about a possible increase in hybrid threats"", the Border Guard said in a statement. Belarusian authorities were increasingly involved in organising the flow of illegal immigrants, it said.

EU members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which share a border with Belarus, have worried increasingly about border crossings since hundreds of Russian battle-hardened Wagner mercenaries arrived Belarus last month at the invitation of President Alexander Lukashenko.

Lukashenko has said several times that he has been restraining Wagner fighters who want to attack Poland.

Poland has also seen an increase in the number of mainly Middle Eastern and African migrants trying to cross the border in recent months.

Poland is planning to move up to 10,000 additional troops to the border with Belarus to support the Border Guard, Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Thursday.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, sought to cross into Poland from Belarus but were pushed back.

Summary Around 500,000 T of Vietnamese rice prices renegotiated

Buyers pay $30-$80/T more for Vietnamese fragrant rice

Rising prices threaten consumers with food price inflation

SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Vietnamese exporters have renegotiated higher prices for around half a million metric tons of rice, two trade sources said, as global prices climbed to 15-year highs following India's ban on overseas sales last month.

This is the first confirmation of rice prices climbing in the wake of India's surprise ban, with importers paying more for one of the world's most widely consumed staples amid tightening supplies.

Asian rice exporters had raised offered prices by around 20% since India banned non-basmati white rice exports last month, heightening food inflation risks for some of the most vulnerable consumers in Asia and Africa who are already struggling with lower supplies due to erratic weather and the war in Ukraine.

""Buyers have agreed to pay higher prices for some of (the) cargoes which they bought for August shipment,"" said one trader at an international trading company. He added that around 200,000 tons of rice have been shipped this month while 300,000 tons were yet to be loaded at Vietnamese ports.

Importers, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have paid between $30 and $80 a ton above deals signed at around $550 a ton for fragrant Vietnamese rice before India banned white rice exports in July, the Singapore-based traders said.

This gives sellers additional income of around $15 million to $40 million compared with prices agreed before India's curbs.

The export ban by India, which accounts for 40% of world rice supplies, has taken out 10 million tons of supplies from the international market.

""Renegotiations were primarily carried out for non-basmati white rice,"" said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading house.

""Both buyers and sellers absorbed a portion of the price increase due to the jump in local rice prices. Sellers did not raise prices to match the current market price.""

Fragrant rice from Vietnam was being offered at as high as $700 a ton but prices were renegotiated around $580-$630 a ton, traders said.

Thailand's 5% broken rice prices are being offered at $650-$655 per ton, while the similar variety from Vietnam is offered at $620-$630 per ton.

Thai rice prices were quoted at $545 per ton and Vietnam at $515-$525 per ton before India decided to curb exports in July.

"Niger junta says open to talks as Putin, US stress peace","Aug 15 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Tuesday said that it was open to talks to resolve a regional crisis caused by last month's military coup, while Russia and the United States called for a peaceful resolution.

Western powers and democratic African governments have called for the coup leaders to reinstate ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, who they have detained since July 26, but the military leaders have refused and rejected attempts at negotiation.

West African army chiefs will meet on Thursday and Friday in Ghana to prepare for a possible military intervention, which the main regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has threatened to launch if diplomacy fails.

Any military intervention could further destabilise the impoverished Sahel, where an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State has displaced millions over the past decade and fuelled a hunger crisis.

""We are in a process of transition. We have explained the ins and outs, reiterated our willingness to remain open and to talk to all parties, but we have insisted on the need for the country to be independent,"" said Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine, who was appointed prime minister by the military last week.

He spoke after a trip to meet Chad's President Mahamat Deby, who staged his own coup in 2021. Niger's takeover is the seventh in West and Central Africa in three years.

The coup and its aftermath have sucked in international powers with strategic interests in the region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Mali's military leader about the recent coup in neighbouring Niger on Tuesday, a call likely to cause concern among Western governments that fear growing Russian influence in West Africa's Sahel region.

Putin ""stressed the importance of a peaceful resolution of the situation for a more stable Sahel,"" Mali's interim President Assimi Goita said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was committed to a diplomatic resolution, and said Niger was a partner it did not want to lose.

Singh declined to call the takeover a coup but said it ""certainly looks like an attempted coup.""

Meanwhile, ECOWAS has the support of Central Africa's regional bloc ECCAS in efforts to overturn Niger's coup and restore constitutional order, Nigerian President and ECOWAS Chairman Bola Tinubu said on Tuesday.

""I understand the fear of our people on any form of military action. We are working to keep the sanctions in place and we are following them to the letter,"" he said in a statement.

Russian influence in West Africa has grown while the West's has waned since a string of coups began. Military leaders in Mali and Burkina Faso have kicked out troops from former colonial power France and strengthened ties with Moscow.

In Mali, the army government also brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses.

Under Bazoum, Niger remained a Western ally. The U.S., France, Germany and Italy have troops stationed there under agreements with the now-deposed civilian government.

Putin has called for a return to constitutional order in Niger, while Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin welcomed the army takeover and offered his services.

Support for Russia has appeared to surge in Niger since the coup, with junta supporters waving Russian flags at rallies and calling for France to disengage.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

Importers, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have paid between $30 and $80 a ton above deals signed at around $550 a ton for fragrant Vietnamese rice before India banned white rice exports in July, the Singapore-based traders said.

This gives sellers additional income of around $15 million to $40 million compared with prices agreed before India's curbs.

The export ban by India, which accounts for 40% of world rice supplies, has taken out 10 million tons of supplies from the international market.

""Renegotiations were primarily carried out for non-basmati white rice,"" said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading house.

""Both buyers and sellers absorbed a portion of the price increase due to the jump in local rice prices. Sellers did not raise prices to match the current market price.""

Fragrant rice from Vietnam was being offered at as high as $700 a ton but prices were renegotiated around $580-$630 a ton, traders said.

Thailand's 5% broken rice prices are being offered at $650-$655 per ton, while the similar variety from Vietnam is offered at $620-$630 per ton.

Thai rice prices were quoted at $545 per ton and Vietnam at $515-$525 per ton before India decided to curb exports in July.

"Niger junta says open to talks as Putin, US stress peace","Aug 15 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Tuesday said that it was open to talks to resolve a regional crisis caused by last month's military coup, while Russia and the United States called for a peaceful resolution.

Western powers and democratic African governments have called for the coup leaders to reinstate ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, who they have detained since July 26, but the military leaders have refused and rejected attempts at negotiation.

West African army chiefs will meet on Thursday and Friday in Ghana to prepare for a possible military intervention, which the main regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has threatened to launch if diplomacy fails.

Any military intervention could further destabilise the impoverished Sahel, where an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State has displaced millions over the past decade and fuelled a hunger crisis.

""We are in a process of transition. We have explained the ins and outs, reiterated our willingness to remain open and to talk to all parties, but we have insisted on the need for the country to be independent,"" said Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine, who was appointed prime minister by the military last week.

He spoke after a trip to meet Chad's President Mahamat Deby, who staged his own coup in 2021. Niger's takeover is the seventh in West and Central Africa in three years.

The coup and its aftermath have sucked in international powers with strategic interests in the region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Mali's military leader about the recent coup in neighbouring Niger on Tuesday, a call likely to cause concern among Western governments that fear growing Russian influence in West Africa's Sahel region.

Putin ""stressed the importance of a peaceful resolution of the situation for a more stable Sahel,"" Mali's interim President Assimi Goita said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was committed to a diplomatic resolution, and said Niger was a partner it did not want to lose.

Singh declined to call the takeover a coup but said it ""certainly looks like an attempted coup.""

Meanwhile, ECOWAS has the support of Central Africa's regional bloc ECCAS in efforts to overturn Niger's coup and restore constitutional order, Nigerian President and ECOWAS Chairman Bola Tinubu said on Tuesday.

""I understand the fear of our people on any form of military action. We are working to keep the sanctions in place and we are following them to the letter,"" he said in a statement.

Russian influence in West Africa has grown while the West's has waned since a string of coups began. Military leaders in Mali and Burkina Faso have kicked out troops from former colonial power France and strengthened ties with Moscow.

In Mali, the army government also brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses.

Under Bazoum, Niger remained a Western ally. The U.S., France, Germany and Italy have troops stationed there under agreements with the now-deposed civilian government.

Putin has called for a return to constitutional order in Niger, while Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin welcomed the army takeover and offered his services.

Support for Russia has appeared to surge in Niger since the coup, with junta supporters waving Russian flags at rallies and calling for France to disengage.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Guatemalan presidential candidate Bernardo Arevalo is seen winning an August 20 runoff election backed by 61% of valid votes, followed by former first lady Sandra Torres, according to a CID Gallup poll published on Wednesday.

Arevalo, an ex-diplomat who is running on an anti-corruption platform, scored a surprise second place in June's first round, finishing close behind Torres.

""Our growth trajectory continues, as more of us now want change in Guatemala,"" the candidate said on social messaging platform X. ""However, this is not a reason to get complacent, because the old guard have already demonstrated that they are desperate and willing to go to any lengths.""

Guatemalan authorities halted processing of the results and ordered the suspension of Arevalo's party, alleging the illegal registration of party members, but the suspension was reversed by the country's top court.

The electoral process has raised international concern, with the head of the Organization of American States flagging 'clear interference' with the vote.

The government has said it is committed to ensuring peaceful elections.

CID Gallup's poll found that 52% of respondents who considered voting for Arevalo said the country would improve with his presidency, while only 6% of Torres' voters thought so.

The poll surveyed 1,819 adults face-to-face between August 4 and 13 with an estimated margin of error of plus or minus 2.3%.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts slipped by 10% in July compared with the previous month, which had produced the strongest figures in ten years, data from the national housing agency showed on Wednesday.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts fell to 254,966 units in July from a revised 283,498 units in June, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) said.

Economists in a Reuters poll had expected starts to fall to 240,000 in July.

Summary

Companies Q2 revenue 287.9 bln yuan vs forecast 278.9 bln yuan

Says more vendors joined, customers shopped more often

Shares fall in early trade

Aug 16 (Reuters) - JD.com (9618.HK), beat analyst forecasts for second-quarter revenue on Wednesday, as the Chinese e-commerce giant's focus on lower-priced products paid off in the fight for customers in an economic slowdown.

The company said it attracted more vendors to its platform, helped by lower thresholds and costs for them to join, and that users shopped more frequently as its product range expanded.

Competition is intense in the commerce sector and rivals such as Alibaba Group (9988.HK) and PDD Holdings Inc (PDD.O) are also trying to host more vendors to boost choice for buyers.

Helped by its so-called ten billion yuan subsidy programme, customers are also logging on to JD.com's platform more often to make purchases, the company said, without providing figures.

CEO Sandy Xu said in some core categories, such as electronics where JD.com is a strong player, the company continued to increase market share in the second quarter despite a weak property market and modest recovery in durable goods demand. ""In fact the electronics category is still facing pressure,"" she said, ""but we outperformed the industry.""

JD.com's second-quarter revenue rose 7.6% to 287.9 billion yuan ($39.7 billion), beating analysts' average estimate of 278.85 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, an e-commerce consulting firm based in Beijing, said JD.com's low price strategy was in tune with consumers' focus emerging from the pandemic, and its strength in service and logistics helped it appeal to higher end urban customers.

""JD.com's low price strategy, coupled with these advantages, has broadened the user base and made the platform a preferred choice over Pinduoduo in the 3C and appliance verticals,"" Cooke said, referring to computer, consumer electronics and communications products.

After China abandoned its stringent COVID-19 lockdown policies, consumption failed to rebound immediately amid a slowdown in the overall economy.

Recent official economic data has also been gloomy, with the consumer price index tipping into deflation in July.

Retail sales rose just 2.5%, slowing from a 3.1% increase in June, despite the summer travel season. Analysts had expected retail sales to grow 4.5%.

U.S.-listed JD.com shares were down almost 5% in early trade.

"Sudan 'spiralling out of control' as 1 million flee country, UN warns","Summary Number of refugees rises above one million

Residents face attacks, looting, blackouts

Many bodies uncollected or unidentified

Aug 15 (Reuters) - More than 1 million people have fled Sudan to neighbouring states and people inside the country are running out of food and dying due to lack of healthcare after four months of war, the United Nations warned on Tuesday.

Fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated the capital Khartoum and sparked ethnically driven attacks in Darfur, threatening to plunge Sudan into a protracted civil war and destabilise the region.

""Time is running out for farmers to plant the crops that will feed them and their neighbours. Medical supplies are scarce. The situation is spiralling out of control,"" U.N. agencies said in a joint statement.

""At the end of the day, this war will end at a negotiating table,"" said deputy Sovereign Council head Malik Agar, in a potential softening of the army's stance, citing the hardships citizens have endured.

The war has caused 1,017,449 people to cross from Sudan into neighbouring countries, many already struggling with the impact of conflicts or economic crises, while those displaced within Sudan are estimated to number 3,433,025, according to the latest weekly figures published by the IOM.

Fighting erupted on April 15 over tensions linked to a planned transition to civilian rule, exposing civilians in the capital and beyond to daily battles and attacks.

The millions who remain in Khartoum and cities in the Darfur and Kordofan regions have faced rampant looting and long power, communications and water cuts.

""The remains of many of those killed have not been collected, identified or buried,"" but the U.N. estimates that more than 4,000 have been killed, Elizabeth Throssell, spokesperson for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a briefing in Geneva.

Reports of sexual assaults have increased by 50%, said U.N. population fund official Laila Baker.

BLACKOUT

Large swathes of the country have been suffering from an electricity blackout since Sunday that has also taken mobile networks offline, according to a statement from the national electricity authority.

Agar said the circumstances necessitated the formation of a caretaker government to provide services and to rebuild.

Seasonal rains that increase the risk of water-borne diseases have destroyed or damaged the homes of up to 13,500 people, the U.N. estimates.

In a speech on Monday, army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan accused the RSF of aiming ""to take the country back to an era before the modern state"" and ""committing every crime that can be imagined.""

The RSF has accused the army of trying to seize full power under the direction of loyalists of Omar al-Bashir, the autocratic leader who was toppled during a popular uprising in 2019.

Efforts led by Saudi Arabia and the United States to negotiate a ceasefire in the current conflict have stalled, and humanitarian agencies have struggled to provide relief because of insecurity, looting and bureaucratic hurdles.

VILNIUS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the Baltic country's border with Russian ally Belarus on Tuesday, after 96 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross in 24 hours.

Border Guard officers have also been recalled from their holidays to help with patrols.

Latvia has ""information about a possible increase in hybrid threats"", the Border Guard said in a statement. Belarusian authorities were increasingly involved in organising the flow of illegal immigrants, it said.

EU members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which share a border with Belarus, have worried increasingly about border crossings since hundreds of Russian battle-hardened Wagner mercenaries arrived Belarus last month at the invitation of President Alexander Lukashenko.

Lukashenko has said several times that he has been restraining Wagner fighters who want to attack Poland.

Poland has also seen an increase in the number of mainly Middle Eastern and African migrants trying to cross the border in recent months.

Poland is planning to move up to 10,000 additional troops to the border with Belarus to support the Border Guard, Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Thursday.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, sought to cross into Poland from Belarus but were pushed back.

Summary Around 500,000 T of Vietnamese rice prices renegotiated

Buyers pay $30-$80/T more for Vietnamese fragrant rice

Rising prices threaten consumers with food price inflation

SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Vietnamese exporters have renegotiated higher prices for around half a million metric tons of rice, two trade sources said, as global prices climbed to 15-year highs following India's ban on overseas sales last month.

This is the first confirmation of rice prices climbing in the wake of India's surprise ban, with importers paying more for one of the world's most widely consumed staples amid tightening supplies.

Asian rice exporters had raised offered prices by around 20% since India banned non-basmati white rice exports last month, heightening food inflation risks for some of the most vulnerable consumers in Asia and Africa who are already struggling with lower supplies due to erratic weather and the war in Ukraine.

""Buyers have agreed to pay higher prices for some of (the) cargoes which they bought for August shipment,"" said one trader at an international trading company. He added that around 200,000 tons of rice have been shipped this month while 300,000 tons were yet to be loaded at Vietnamese ports.

Importers, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have paid between $30 and $80 a ton above deals signed at around $550 a ton for fragrant Vietnamese rice before India banned white rice exports in July, the Singapore-based traders said.

This gives sellers additional income of around $15 million to $40 million compared with prices agreed before India's curbs.

The export ban by India, which accounts for 40% of world rice supplies, has taken out 10 million tons of supplies from the international market.

""Renegotiations were primarily carried out for non-basmati white rice,"" said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading house.

""Both buyers and sellers absorbed a portion of the price increase due to the jump in local rice prices. Sellers did not raise prices to match the current market price.""

Fragrant rice from Vietnam was being offered at as high as $700 a ton but prices were renegotiated around $580-$630 a ton, traders said.

Thailand's 5% broken rice prices are being offered at $650-$655 per ton, while the similar variety from Vietnam is offered at $620-$630 per ton.

Thai rice prices were quoted at $545 per ton and Vietnam at $515-$525 per ton before India decided to curb exports in July.

REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SAO PAULO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A key aide to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Wednesday that there was no contradiction in defending an ecological transition and new oil exploration fronts, in remarks later echoed by the head of oil giant Petrobras (PETR4.SA).

The comments by Lula's chief of staff, Rui Costa, come as state-run Petrobras seeks clearance to drill a well at the mouth of the Amazon River, a controversial topic dividing the leftist leader's own coalition.

""There is no contradiction,"" Costa said in a radio interview. ""It's in the name - it is an ecological and energy transition.""

Last week, Amazon rainforest nations faced divisions over proposals to block new oil drilling as they met for the first time in 14 years in Brazil.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro pushed Lula to block all new oil development in the region, as Brazil weighs whether to develop the potentially huge offshore oil find on the coast of northern Amapa state.

Lula has staked his international reputation on reversing environmental back-sliding under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, when Amazon deforestation soared.

Yet he is under pressure to deliver much-needed growth to poor, underdeveloped regions in the north and northeast, and wants Petrobras to be an engine of that growth.

""We are going to build a sustainable, renewable energy matrix, but it's obvious that we need to fund that transition process,"" Costa said.

Later on Wednesday, Petrobras Chief Executive Jean Paul Prates defended the company's position in favor of drilling and emphasized its role in the energy transition by investing in renewable projects such as offshore wind farms.

""We must produce oil to make money and pay for the energy transition,"" Prates told a senate committee hearing.

Environmental protection agency Ibama has previously rejected Petrobras' request to drill the well at the mouth of the Amazon, citing discrepancies in environmental studies. However, the oil giant has appealed the decision.

Aug 15 (Reuters) - More than 1 million people have fled Sudan to neighbouring states and people inside the country are running out of food and dying due to lack of healthcare after four months of war, the United Nations warned on Tuesday.

Latvia sends army to guard border with Belarus as illegal crossing attempts mount,"Latvian special unit Border Guard officer patrols along the fence at Latvia-Belarus border near Robeznieki, Latvia August 8, 2023. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

VILNIUS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the Baltic country's border with Russian ally Belarus on Tuesday, after 96 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross in 24 hours.

Border Guard officers have also been recalled from their holidays to help with patrols.

Latvia has ""information about a possible increase in hybrid threats"", the Border Guard said in a statement. Belarusian authorities were increasingly involved in organising the flow of illegal immigrants, it said.

EU members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which share a border with Belarus, have worried increasingly about border crossings since hundreds of Russian battle-hardened Wagner mercenaries arrived Belarus last month at the invitation of President Alexander Lukashenko.

Lukashenko has said several times that he has been restraining Wagner fighters who want to attack Poland.

Poland has also seen an increase in the number of mainly Middle Eastern and African migrants trying to cross the border in recent months.

Poland is planning to move up to 10,000 additional troops to the border with Belarus to support the Border Guard, Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Thursday.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, sought to cross into Poland from Belarus but were pushed back.

Summary Around 500,000 T of Vietnamese rice prices renegotiated

Buyers pay $30-$80/T more for Vietnamese fragrant rice

Rising prices threaten consumers with food price inflation

SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Vietnamese exporters have renegotiated higher prices for around half a million metric tons of rice, two trade sources said, as global prices climbed to 15-year highs following India's ban on overseas sales last month.

This is the first confirmation of rice prices climbing in the wake of India's surprise ban, with importers paying more for one of the world's most widely consumed staples amid tightening supplies.

Asian rice exporters had raised offered prices by around 20% since India banned non-basmati white rice exports last month, heightening food inflation risks for some of the most vulnerable consumers in Asia and Africa who are already struggling with lower supplies due to erratic weather and the war in Ukraine.

""Buyers have agreed to pay higher prices for some of (the) cargoes which they bought for August shipment,"" said one trader at an international trading company. He added that around 200,000 tons of rice have been shipped this month while 300,000 tons were yet to be loaded at Vietnamese ports.

Importers, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have paid between $30 and $80 a ton above deals signed at around $550 a ton for fragrant Vietnamese rice before India banned white rice exports in July, the Singapore-based traders said.

This gives sellers additional income of around $15 million to $40 million compared with prices agreed before India's curbs.

The export ban by India, which accounts for 40% of world rice supplies, has taken out 10 million tons of supplies from the international market.

""Renegotiations were primarily carried out for non-basmati white rice,"" said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading house.

""Both buyers and sellers absorbed a portion of the price increase due to the jump in local rice prices. Sellers did not raise prices to match the current market price.""

Fragrant rice from Vietnam was being offered at as high as $700 a ton but prices were renegotiated around $580-$630 a ton, traders said.

Thailand's 5% broken rice prices are being offered at $650-$655 per ton, while the similar variety from Vietnam is offered at $620-$630 per ton.

Thai rice prices were quoted at $545 per ton and Vietnam at $515-$525 per ton before India decided to curb exports in July.

"Niger junta says open to talks as Putin, US stress peace","Aug 15 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Tuesday said that it was open to talks to resolve a regional crisis caused by last month's military coup, while Russia and the United States called for a peaceful resolution.

Western powers and democratic African governments have called for the coup leaders to reinstate ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, who they have detained since July 26, but the military leaders have refused and rejected attempts at negotiation.

West African army chiefs will meet on Thursday and Friday in Ghana to prepare for a possible military intervention, which the main regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has threatened to launch if diplomacy fails.

Any military intervention could further destabilise the impoverished Sahel, where an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State has displaced millions over the past decade and fuelled a hunger crisis.

""We are in a process of transition. We have explained the ins and outs, reiterated our willingness to remain open and to talk to all parties, but we have insisted on the need for the country to be independent,"" said Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine, who was appointed prime minister by the military last week.

He spoke after a trip to meet Chad's President Mahamat Deby, who staged his own coup in 2021. Niger's takeover is the seventh in West and Central Africa in three years.

The coup and its aftermath have sucked in international powers with strategic interests in the region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Mali's military leader about the recent coup in neighbouring Niger on Tuesday, a call likely to cause concern among Western governments that fear growing Russian influence in West Africa's Sahel region.

Putin ""stressed the importance of a peaceful resolution of the situation for a more stable Sahel,"" Mali's interim President Assimi Goita said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was committed to a diplomatic resolution, and said Niger was a partner it did not want to lose.

Singh declined to call the takeover a coup but said it ""certainly looks like an attempted coup.""

Meanwhile, ECOWAS has the support of Central Africa's regional bloc ECCAS in efforts to overturn Niger's coup and restore constitutional order, Nigerian President and ECOWAS Chairman Bola Tinubu said on Tuesday.

""I understand the fear of our people on any form of military action. We are working to keep the sanctions in place and we are following them to the letter,"" he said in a statement.

Russian influence in West Africa has grown while the West's has waned since a string of coups began. Military leaders in Mali and Burkina Faso have kicked out troops from former colonial power France and strengthened ties with Moscow.

In Mali, the army government also brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses.

Under Bazoum, Niger remained a Western ally. The U.S., France, Germany and Italy have troops stationed there under agreements with the now-deposed civilian government.

Putin has called for a return to constitutional order in Niger, while Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin welcomed the army takeover and offered his services.

Support for Russia has appeared to surge in Niger since the coup, with junta supporters waving Russian flags at rallies and calling for France to disengage.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

REUTERS/Cristina Chiquin/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Guatemalan presidential candidate Bernardo Arevalo is seen winning an August 20 runoff election backed by 61% of valid votes, followed by former first lady Sandra Torres, according to a CID Gallup poll published on Wednesday.

Arevalo, an ex-diplomat who is running on an anti-corruption platform, scored a surprise second place in June's first round, finishing close behind Torres.

""Our growth trajectory continues, as more of us now want change in Guatemala,"" the candidate said on social messaging platform X. ""However, this is not a reason to get complacent, because the old guard have already demonstrated that they are desperate and willing to go to any lengths.""

Guatemalan authorities halted processing of the results and ordered the suspension of Arevalo's party, alleging the illegal registration of party members, but the suspension was reversed by the country's top court.

The electoral process has raised international concern, with the head of the Organization of American States flagging 'clear interference' with the vote.

The government has said it is committed to ensuring peaceful elections.

CID Gallup's poll found that 52% of respondents who considered voting for Arevalo said the country would improve with his presidency, while only 6% of Torres' voters thought so.

The poll surveyed 1,819 adults face-to-face between August 4 and 13 with an estimated margin of error of plus or minus 2.3%.

REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SAO PAULO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A key aide to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Wednesday that there was no contradiction in defending an ecological transition and new oil exploration fronts, in remarks later echoed by the head of oil giant Petrobras (PETR4.SA).

The comments by Lula's chief of staff, Rui Costa, come as state-run Petrobras seeks clearance to drill a well at the mouth of the Amazon River, a controversial topic dividing the leftist leader's own coalition.

""There is no contradiction,"" Costa said in a radio interview. ""It's in the name - it is an ecological and energy transition.""

Last week, Amazon rainforest nations faced divisions over proposals to block new oil drilling as they met for the first time in 14 years in Brazil.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro pushed Lula to block all new oil development in the region, as Brazil weighs whether to develop the potentially huge offshore oil find on the coast of northern Amapa state.

Lula has staked his international reputation on reversing environmental back-sliding under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, when Amazon deforestation soared.

Yet he is under pressure to deliver much-needed growth to poor, underdeveloped regions in the north and northeast, and wants Petrobras to be an engine of that growth.

""We are going to build a sustainable, renewable energy matrix, but it's obvious that we need to fund that transition process,"" Costa said.

Later on Wednesday, Petrobras Chief Executive Jean Paul Prates defended the company's position in favor of drilling and emphasized its role in the energy transition by investing in renewable projects such as offshore wind farms.

""We must produce oil to make money and pay for the energy transition,"" Prates told a senate committee hearing.

Environmental protection agency Ibama has previously rejected Petrobras' request to drill the well at the mouth of the Amazon, citing discrepancies in environmental studies. However, the oil giant has appealed the decision.

"Sudan 'spiralling out of control' as 1 million flee country, UN warns","Summary Number of refugees rises above one million

Residents face attacks, looting, blackouts

Many bodies uncollected or unidentified

Aug 15 (Reuters) - More than 1 million people have fled Sudan to neighbouring states and people inside the country are running out of food and dying due to lack of healthcare after four months of war, the United Nations warned on Tuesday.

Fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated the capital Khartoum and sparked ethnically driven attacks in Darfur, threatening to plunge Sudan into a protracted civil war and destabilise the region.

""Time is running out for farmers to plant the crops that will feed them and their neighbours. Medical supplies are scarce. The situation is spiralling out of control,"" U.N. agencies said in a joint statement.

""At the end of the day, this war will end at a negotiating table,"" said deputy Sovereign Council head Malik Agar, in a potential softening of the army's stance, citing the hardships citizens have endured.

The war has caused 1,017,449 people to cross from Sudan into neighbouring countries, many already struggling with the impact of conflicts or economic crises, while those displaced within Sudan are estimated to number 3,433,025, according to the latest weekly figures published by the IOM.

Fighting erupted on April 15 over tensions linked to a planned transition to civilian rule, exposing civilians in the capital and beyond to daily battles and attacks.

The millions who remain in Khartoum and cities in the Darfur and Kordofan regions have faced rampant looting and long power, communications and water cuts.

""The remains of many of those killed have not been collected, identified or buried,"" but the U.N. estimates that more than 4,000 have been killed, Elizabeth Throssell, spokesperson for the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a briefing in Geneva.

Reports of sexual assaults have increased by 50%, said U.N. population fund official Laila Baker.

BLACKOUT

Large swathes of the country have been suffering from an electricity blackout since Sunday that has also taken mobile networks offline, according to a statement from the national electricity authority.

Agar said the circumstances necessitated the formation of a caretaker government to provide services and to rebuild.

Seasonal rains that increase the risk of water-borne diseases have destroyed or damaged the homes of up to 13,500 people, the U.N. estimates.

In a speech on Monday, army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan accused the RSF of aiming ""to take the country back to an era before the modern state"" and ""committing every crime that can be imagined.""

The RSF has accused the army of trying to seize full power under the direction of loyalists of Omar al-Bashir, the autocratic leader who was toppled during a popular uprising in 2019.

Efforts led by Saudi Arabia and the United States to negotiate a ceasefire in the current conflict have stalled, and humanitarian agencies have struggled to provide relief because of insecurity, looting and bureaucratic hurdles.

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A container ship left the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa on Wednesday morning, the government said, using what it has described as a new temporary corridor for merchant ships to and from its ports, which are blockaded by Russia.

Ukraine last week announced a ""humanitarian corridor"" in the Black Sea to release cargo ships that have been trapped in its ports since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. read more

Moscow has not indicated whether it would respect the shipping corridor, and shipping and insurance sources have expressed concerns about safety.

He identified the container ship as the Hong-Kong-flagged JOSEPH SCHULTE and said it had been in the port since Feb. 23, 2022, the day before the invasion.

He said the ship was carrying more than 30,000 metric tons of cargo in 2,114 containers.

""The corridor will be primarily used to evacuate ships that were in the Ukrainian ports (Chornomorsk, Odesa and Pivdennyi) at the time of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation,"" the deputy prime minister said.

Summary Around 500,000 T of Vietnamese rice prices renegotiated

Buyers pay $30-$80/T more for Vietnamese fragrant rice

Rising prices threaten consumers with food price inflation

SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Vietnamese exporters have renegotiated higher prices for around half a million metric tons of rice, two trade sources said, as global prices climbed to 15-year highs following India's ban on overseas sales last month.

This is the first confirmation of rice prices climbing in the wake of India's surprise ban, with importers paying more for one of the world's most widely consumed staples amid tightening supplies.

Asian rice exporters had raised offered prices by around 20% since India banned non-basmati white rice exports last month, heightening food inflation risks for some of the most vulnerable consumers in Asia and Africa who are already struggling with lower supplies due to erratic weather and the war in Ukraine.

""Buyers have agreed to pay higher prices for some of (the) cargoes which they bought for August shipment,"" said one trader at an international trading company. He added that around 200,000 tons of rice have been shipped this month while 300,000 tons were yet to be loaded at Vietnamese ports.

Importers, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have paid between $30 and $80 a ton above deals signed at around $550 a ton for fragrant Vietnamese rice before India banned white rice exports in July, the Singapore-based traders said.

This gives sellers additional income of around $15 million to $40 million compared with prices agreed before India's curbs.

The export ban by India, which accounts for 40% of world rice supplies, has taken out 10 million tons of supplies from the international market.

""Renegotiations were primarily carried out for non-basmati white rice,"" said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading house.

""Both buyers and sellers absorbed a portion of the price increase due to the jump in local rice prices. Sellers did not raise prices to match the current market price.""

Fragrant rice from Vietnam was being offered at as high as $700 a ton but prices were renegotiated around $580-$630 a ton, traders said.

Thailand's 5% broken rice prices are being offered at $650-$655 per ton, while the similar variety from Vietnam is offered at $620-$630 per ton.

Thai rice prices were quoted at $545 per ton and Vietnam at $515-$525 per ton before India decided to curb exports in July.

"Niger junta says open to talks as Putin, US stress peace","Aug 15 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Tuesday said that it was open to talks to resolve a regional crisis caused by last month's military coup, while Russia and the United States called for a peaceful resolution.

Western powers and democratic African governments have called for the coup leaders to reinstate ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, who they have detained since July 26, but the military leaders have refused and rejected attempts at negotiation.

West African army chiefs will meet on Thursday and Friday in Ghana to prepare for a possible military intervention, which the main regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has threatened to launch if diplomacy fails.

Any military intervention could further destabilise the impoverished Sahel, where an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State has displaced millions over the past decade and fuelled a hunger crisis.

""We are in a process of transition. We have explained the ins and outs, reiterated our willingness to remain open and to talk to all parties, but we have insisted on the need for the country to be independent,"" said Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine, who was appointed prime minister by the military last week.

He spoke after a trip to meet Chad's President Mahamat Deby, who staged his own coup in 2021. Niger's takeover is the seventh in West and Central Africa in three years.

The coup and its aftermath have sucked in international powers with strategic interests in the region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Mali's military leader about the recent coup in neighbouring Niger on Tuesday, a call likely to cause concern among Western governments that fear growing Russian influence in West Africa's Sahel region.

Putin ""stressed the importance of a peaceful resolution of the situation for a more stable Sahel,"" Mali's interim President Assimi Goita said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was committed to a diplomatic resolution, and said Niger was a partner it did not want to lose.

Singh declined to call the takeover a coup but said it ""certainly looks like an attempted coup.""

Meanwhile, ECOWAS has the support of Central Africa's regional bloc ECCAS in efforts to overturn Niger's coup and restore constitutional order, Nigerian President and ECOWAS Chairman Bola Tinubu said on Tuesday.

""I understand the fear of our people on any form of military action. We are working to keep the sanctions in place and we are following them to the letter,"" he said in a statement.

Russian influence in West Africa has grown while the West's has waned since a string of coups began. Military leaders in Mali and Burkina Faso have kicked out troops from former colonial power France and strengthened ties with Moscow.

In Mali, the army government also brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses.

Under Bazoum, Niger remained a Western ally. The U.S., France, Germany and Italy have troops stationed there under agreements with the now-deposed civilian government.

Putin has called for a return to constitutional order in Niger, while Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin welcomed the army takeover and offered his services.

Support for Russia has appeared to surge in Niger since the coup, with junta supporters waving Russian flags at rallies and calling for France to disengage.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

REUTERS/Cristina Chiquin/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Guatemalan presidential candidate Bernardo Arevalo is seen winning an August 20 runoff election backed by 61% of valid votes, followed by former first lady Sandra Torres, according to a CID Gallup poll published on Wednesday.

Arevalo, an ex-diplomat who is running on an anti-corruption platform, scored a surprise second place in June's first round, finishing close behind Torres.

""Our growth trajectory continues, as more of us now want change in Guatemala,"" the candidate said on social messaging platform X. ""However, this is not a reason to get complacent, because the old guard have already demonstrated that they are desperate and willing to go to any lengths.""

Guatemalan authorities halted processing of the results and ordered the suspension of Arevalo's party, alleging the illegal registration of party members, but the suspension was reversed by the country's top court.

The electoral process has raised international concern, with the head of the Organization of American States flagging 'clear interference' with the vote.

The government has said it is committed to ensuring peaceful elections.

CID Gallup's poll found that 52% of respondents who considered voting for Arevalo said the country would improve with his presidency, while only 6% of Torres' voters thought so.

The poll surveyed 1,819 adults face-to-face between August 4 and 13 with an estimated margin of error of plus or minus 2.3%.

Lula aide says no contradiction in backing new Brazil oil exploration fronts,"Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva talks with Chief of Staff of the Presidency Rui Costa during a ceremony at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil March 10, 2023. REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SAO PAULO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A key aide to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Wednesday that there was no contradiction in defending an ecological transition and new oil exploration fronts, in remarks later echoed by the head of oil giant Petrobras (PETR4.SA).

The comments by Lula's chief of staff, Rui Costa, come as state-run Petrobras seeks clearance to drill a well at the mouth of the Amazon River, a controversial topic dividing the leftist leader's own coalition.

""There is no contradiction,"" Costa said in a radio interview. ""It's in the name - it is an ecological and energy transition.""

Last week, Amazon rainforest nations faced divisions over proposals to block new oil drilling as they met for the first time in 14 years in Brazil.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro pushed Lula to block all new oil development in the region, as Brazil weighs whether to develop the potentially huge offshore oil find on the coast of northern Amapa state.

Lula has staked his international reputation on reversing environmental back-sliding under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, when Amazon deforestation soared.

Yet he is under pressure to deliver much-needed growth to poor, underdeveloped regions in the north and northeast, and wants Petrobras to be an engine of that growth.

""We are going to build a sustainable, renewable energy matrix, but it's obvious that we need to fund that transition process,"" Costa said.

Later on Wednesday, Petrobras Chief Executive Jean Paul Prates defended the company's position in favor of drilling and emphasized its role in the energy transition by investing in renewable projects such as offshore wind farms.

""We must produce oil to make money and pay for the energy transition,"" Prates told a senate committee hearing.

Environmental protection agency Ibama has previously rejected Petrobras' request to drill the well at the mouth of the Amazon, citing discrepancies in environmental studies. However, the oil giant has appealed the decision.

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A container ship left the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa on Wednesday morning, the government said, using what it has described as a new temporary corridor for merchant ships to and from its ports, which are blockaded by Russia.

Ukraine last week announced a ""humanitarian corridor"" in the Black Sea to release cargo ships that have been trapped in its ports since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. read more

Moscow has not indicated whether it would respect the shipping corridor, and shipping and insurance sources have expressed concerns about safety.

""A first vessel used the temporary corridor for merchant ships to/from the ports of Big Odesa,"" Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Facebook.

He identified the container ship as the Hong-Kong-flagged JOSEPH SCHULTE and said it had been in the port since Feb. 23, 2022, the day before the invasion.

He said the ship was carrying more than 30,000 metric tons of cargo in 2,114 containers.

""The corridor will be primarily used to evacuate ships that were in the Ukrainian ports (Chornomorsk, Odesa and Pivdennyi) at the time of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation,"" the deputy prime minister said.

Latvia could begin Ukrainian grain exports in autumn -Latvian Railways,"VILNIUS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - EU member Latvia could begin exporting Ukrainian grain through its ports this autumn, with volumes possibly reaching a million metric tonnes per year, the chairman of Latvian Railways' board said in Tuesday.

""Right now, an opportunity has appeared for Ukrainian grain transportation,"" Rinalds Plavnieks told Latvia's public broadcaster.

The grain would need to be shipped through Poland, which uses a different rail gauge to Latvia and Ukraine, necessitating two changes, which adds to costs.

""We see that around 500,000 to a million tons a year could be transported via this transit corridor,"" Plavnieks added.

Moscow has withdrawn from a deal to allow Black Sea exports of grain from Ukraine, one of the world's top exporters, and has been attacking its agricultural and port infrastructure.

Last month Lithuania asked the European Commission to develop a route for Ukrainian grain through five ports in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The five ports have a combined annual grain export capacity of 25 million tons, the letter said.

Latvia sends army to guard border with Belarus as illegal crossing attempts mount,"Latvian special unit Border Guard officer patrols along the fence at Latvia-Belarus border near Robeznieki, Latvia August 8, 2023. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

VILNIUS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Latvia's defence minister ordered the army to help guard the Baltic country's border with Russian ally Belarus on Tuesday, after 96 attempts by illegal immigrants to cross in 24 hours.

Border Guard officers have also been recalled from their holidays to help with patrols.

Latvia has ""information about a possible increase in hybrid threats"", the Border Guard said in a statement. Belarusian authorities were increasingly involved in organising the flow of illegal immigrants, it said.

EU members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which share a border with Belarus, have worried increasingly about border crossings since hundreds of Russian battle-hardened Wagner mercenaries arrived Belarus last month at the invitation of President Alexander Lukashenko.

Lukashenko has said several times that he has been restraining Wagner fighters who want to attack Poland.

Poland has also seen an increase in the number of mainly Middle Eastern and African migrants trying to cross the border in recent months.

Poland is planning to move up to 10,000 additional troops to the border with Belarus to support the Border Guard, Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said on Thursday.

In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced an immigration crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, sought to cross into Poland from Belarus but were pushed back.

The moves come after sales of Tesla's China-made vehicles fell 31% in July from June, their first month-on-month decline since December, as the automaker idled some production to prepare for a revamped Model 3 launch.

In contrast, China's BYD (002594.SZ) increased sales from June.

"Niger junta says open to talks as Putin, US stress peace","Aug 15 (Reuters) - Niger's junta on Tuesday said that it was open to talks to resolve a regional crisis caused by last month's military coup, while Russia and the United States called for a peaceful resolution.

Western powers and democratic African governments have called for the coup leaders to reinstate ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, who they have detained since July 26, but the military leaders have refused and rejected attempts at negotiation.

West African army chiefs will meet on Thursday and Friday in Ghana to prepare for a possible military intervention, which the main regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has threatened to launch if diplomacy fails.

Any military intervention could further destabilise the impoverished Sahel, where an insurgency by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State has displaced millions over the past decade and fuelled a hunger crisis.

""We are in a process of transition. We have explained the ins and outs, reiterated our willingness to remain open and to talk to all parties, but we have insisted on the need for the country to be independent,"" said Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine, who was appointed prime minister by the military last week.

He spoke after a trip to meet Chad's President Mahamat Deby, who staged his own coup in 2021. Niger's takeover is the seventh in West and Central Africa in three years.

The coup and its aftermath have sucked in international powers with strategic interests in the region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Mali's military leader about the recent coup in neighbouring Niger on Tuesday, a call likely to cause concern among Western governments that fear growing Russian influence in West Africa's Sahel region.

Putin ""stressed the importance of a peaceful resolution of the situation for a more stable Sahel,"" Mali's interim President Assimi Goita said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was committed to a diplomatic resolution, and said Niger was a partner it did not want to lose.

Singh declined to call the takeover a coup but said it ""certainly looks like an attempted coup.""

Meanwhile, ECOWAS has the support of Central Africa's regional bloc ECCAS in efforts to overturn Niger's coup and restore constitutional order, Nigerian President and ECOWAS Chairman Bola Tinubu said on Tuesday.

""I understand the fear of our people on any form of military action. We are working to keep the sanctions in place and we are following them to the letter,"" he said in a statement.

Russian influence in West Africa has grown while the West's has waned since a string of coups began. Military leaders in Mali and Burkina Faso have kicked out troops from former colonial power France and strengthened ties with Moscow.

In Mali, the army government also brought in mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, who have been accused of executing civilians and committing other grave human rights abuses.

Under Bazoum, Niger remained a Western ally. The U.S., France, Germany and Italy have troops stationed there under agreements with the now-deposed civilian government.

Putin has called for a return to constitutional order in Niger, while Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin welcomed the army takeover and offered his services.

Support for Russia has appeared to surge in Niger since the coup, with junta supporters waving Russian flags at rallies and calling for France to disengage.

Niger's coup leaders have revoked a raft of military agreements with France, although Paris shrugged this off by saying that it did not recognise them as legitimate authorities.

REUTERS/Cristina Chiquin/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Guatemalan presidential candidate Bernardo Arevalo is seen winning an August 20 runoff election backed by 61% of valid votes, followed by former first lady Sandra Torres, according to a CID Gallup poll published on Wednesday.

Arevalo, an ex-diplomat who is running on an anti-corruption platform, scored a surprise second place in June's first round, finishing close behind Torres.

""Our growth trajectory continues, as more of us now want change in Guatemala,"" the candidate said on social messaging platform X. ""However, this is not a reason to get complacent, because the old guard have already demonstrated that they are desperate and willing to go to any lengths.""

Guatemalan authorities halted processing of the results and ordered the suspension of Arevalo's party, alleging the illegal registration of party members, but the suspension was reversed by the country's top court.

The electoral process has raised international concern, with the head of the Organization of American States flagging 'clear interference' with the vote.

The government has said it is committed to ensuring peaceful elections.

CID Gallup's poll found that 52% of respondents who considered voting for Arevalo said the country would improve with his presidency, while only 6% of Torres' voters thought so.

The poll surveyed 1,819 adults face-to-face between August 4 and 13 with an estimated margin of error of plus or minus 2.3%.

Lula aide says no contradiction in backing new Brazil oil exploration fronts,"Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva talks with Chief of Staff of the Presidency Rui Costa during a ceremony at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil March 10, 2023. REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

SAO PAULO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A key aide to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Wednesday that there was no contradiction in defending an ecological transition and new oil exploration fronts, in remarks later echoed by the head of oil giant Petrobras (PETR4.SA).

The comments by Lula's chief of staff, Rui Costa, come as state-run Petrobras seeks clearance to drill a well at the mouth of the Amazon River, a controversial topic dividing the leftist leader's own coalition.

""There is no contradiction,"" Costa said in a radio interview. ""It's in the name - it is an ecological and energy transition.""

Last week, Amazon rainforest nations faced divisions over proposals to block new oil drilling as they met for the first time in 14 years in Brazil.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro pushed Lula to block all new oil development in the region, as Brazil weighs whether to develop the potentially huge offshore oil find on the coast of northern Amapa state.

Lula has staked his international reputation on reversing environmental back-sliding under his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, when Amazon deforestation soared.

Yet he is under pressure to deliver much-needed growth to poor, underdeveloped regions in the north and northeast, and wants Petrobras to be an engine of that growth.

""We are going to build a sustainable, renewable energy matrix, but it's obvious that we need to fund that transition process,"" Costa said.

Later on Wednesday, Petrobras Chief Executive Jean Paul Prates defended the company's position in favor of drilling and emphasized its role in the energy transition by investing in renewable projects such as offshore wind farms.

""We must produce oil to make money and pay for the energy transition,"" Prates told a senate committee hearing.

Environmental protection agency Ibama has previously rejected Petrobras' request to drill the well at the mouth of the Amazon, citing discrepancies in environmental studies. However, the oil giant has appealed the decision.

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A container ship left the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa on Wednesday morning, the government said, using what it has described as a new temporary corridor for merchant ships to and from its ports, which are blockaded by Russia.

Ukraine last week announced a ""humanitarian corridor"" in the Black Sea to release cargo ships that have been trapped in its ports since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. read more

Moscow has not indicated whether it would respect the shipping corridor, and shipping and insurance sources have expressed concerns about safety.

""A first vessel used the temporary corridor for merchant ships to/from the ports of Big Odesa,"" Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Facebook.

He identified the container ship as the Hong-Kong-flagged JOSEPH SCHULTE and said it had been in the port since Feb. 23, 2022, the day before the invasion.

He said the ship was carrying more than 30,000 metric tons of cargo in 2,114 containers.

""The corridor will be primarily used to evacuate ships that were in the Ukrainian ports (Chornomorsk, Odesa and Pivdennyi) at the time of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation,"" the deputy prime minister said.

Latvia could begin Ukrainian grain exports in autumn -Latvian Railways,"VILNIUS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - EU member Latvia could begin exporting Ukrainian grain through its ports this autumn, with volumes possibly reaching a million metric tonnes per year, the chairman of Latvian Railways' board said in Tuesday.

""Right now, an opportunity has appeared for Ukrainian grain transportation,"" Rinalds Plavnieks told Latvia's public broadcaster.

The grain would need to be shipped through Poland, which uses a different rail gauge to Latvia and Ukraine, necessitating two changes, which adds to costs.

""We see that around 500,000 to a million tons a year could be transported via this transit corridor,"" Plavnieks added.

Moscow has withdrawn from a deal to allow Black Sea exports of grain from Ukraine, one of the world's top exporters, and has been attacking its agricultural and port infrastructure.

Last month Lithuania asked the European Commission to develop a route for Ukrainian grain through five ports in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The five ports have a combined annual grain export capacity of 25 million tons, the letter said.

BEIJING, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) has cut prices for its existing inventories of its premium Model S and Model X cars in China by as much as 6.9%, it said on Wednesday.

A post from the carmaker on social media platform Weibo showed the price of the Model S cut 6.7% to 754,900 yuan ($103,477.58) from 808,900 yuan earlier.

The Model X now starts from 836,900 yuan, down 6.9% from 898,900 yuan earlier.

Tesla on Monday said it cut prices in China for its Model Y's long-range and performance versions starting on Aug. 14, which triggered concerns around its profit margins.

The moves come after sales of Tesla's China-made vehicles fell 31% in July from June, their first month-on-month decline since December, as the automaker idled some production to prepare for a revamped Model 3 launch.

In contrast, China's BYD (002594.SZ) increased sales from June.

Intel, however, did not mention the details about the regulatory approvals.

Summary

Companies UK's July annual inflation meets expectations

Precious metal miners lead sectoral losses

Non-life insurers gain on Admiral results

Stocks down 0.4%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The UK's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 edged lower on Wednesday after data showed inflation slowed as expected in July, while precious metal miners fell as gold prices came under pressure.

The blue-chip index FTSE 100 (.FTSE) slid 0.4%, extending losses after hitting a one-month low on Tuesday. The index marked its fourth successive daily decline and had its worst run of losses since early July.

Annual consumer price inflation cooled to 6.8% in July from 7.9% in June, its lowest annual rate since February 2022, but still remained elevated.

However, core inflation soured the sentiment as it came in at a hotter-than-expected 6.9% in July, while inflation in services rose to 7.4% from 7.2% in June.

Sterling rose 0.35% to $1.2744 following the data, as the latest UK inflation numbers reinforced bets that the BoE will likely hike interest rates again.

""Today’s figure does buy the government a bit of breathing space while it’s the core (inflation) figure that will keep pressure on the BoE to keep raising interest rates until the sticky tendrils have been eradicated,"" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell in a note.

Traders are betting on an over 89% probability for the UK central bank to hike interest rates by 25 basis points in its September meeting. 0#BOEWATCH

Precious metal miners (.FTNMX551030) fell 2.1%, touching their lowest levels in over seven years, as gold prices hovered near eight-week lows.

The domestically-focused FTSE 250 (.FTMC) fell 0.4%.

Non-life insurers (.FTNMX303020) were the biggest gainers of the session, rising 3.2%, led by a 7.2% jump in Admiral shares (ADML.L), as the British motor and home insurer reported higher half-year profit.

Shares of Aviva (AV.L) rose 0.9%, after the life and general insurer posted a forecast-beating rise in first-half operating profit.

Insurer Direct Line (DLGD.L) also spiked 7.1%, becoming the top gainer on the mid-cap index.

Meanwhile, global infrastructure company Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) was the biggest loser on the index, down 10.6%, hurt by a tech downturn in its U.S. office projects.

Yet he is under pressure to deliver much-needed growth to poor, underdeveloped regions in the north and northeast, and wants Petrobras to be an engine of that growth.

""We are going to build a sustainable, renewable energy matrix, but it's obvious that we need to fund that transition process,"" Costa said.

Later on Wednesday, Petrobras Chief Executive Jean Paul Prates defended the company's position in favor of drilling and emphasized its role in the energy transition by investing in renewable projects such as offshore wind farms.

""We must produce oil to make money and pay for the energy transition,"" Prates told a senate committee hearing.

Environmental protection agency Ibama has previously rejected Petrobras' request to drill the well at the mouth of the Amazon, citing discrepancies in environmental studies. However, the oil giant has appealed the decision.

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A container ship left the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa on Wednesday morning, the government said, using what it has described as a new temporary corridor for merchant ships to and from its ports, which are blockaded by Russia.

Ukraine last week announced a ""humanitarian corridor"" in the Black Sea to release cargo ships that have been trapped in its ports since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. read more

Moscow has not indicated whether it would respect the shipping corridor, and shipping and insurance sources have expressed concerns about safety.

""A first vessel used the temporary corridor for merchant ships to/from the ports of Big Odesa,"" Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Facebook.

He identified the container ship as the Hong-Kong-flagged JOSEPH SCHULTE and said it had been in the port since Feb. 23, 2022, the day before the invasion.

He said the ship was carrying more than 30,000 metric tons of cargo in 2,114 containers.

""The corridor will be primarily used to evacuate ships that were in the Ukrainian ports (Chornomorsk, Odesa and Pivdennyi) at the time of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation,"" the deputy prime minister said.

Latvia could begin Ukrainian grain exports in autumn -Latvian Railways,"VILNIUS, Aug 15 (Reuters) - EU member Latvia could begin exporting Ukrainian grain through its ports this autumn, with volumes possibly reaching a million metric tonnes per year, the chairman of Latvian Railways' board said in Tuesday.

""Right now, an opportunity has appeared for Ukrainian grain transportation,"" Rinalds Plavnieks told Latvia's public broadcaster.

The grain would need to be shipped through Poland, which uses a different rail gauge to Latvia and Ukraine, necessitating two changes, which adds to costs.

""We see that around 500,000 to a million tons a year could be transported via this transit corridor,"" Plavnieks added.

Moscow has withdrawn from a deal to allow Black Sea exports of grain from Ukraine, one of the world's top exporters, and has been attacking its agricultural and port infrastructure.

Last month Lithuania asked the European Commission to develop a route for Ukrainian grain through five ports in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The five ports have a combined annual grain export capacity of 25 million tons, the letter said.

Intel, which signed a deal to buy Tower last year, will pay a termination fee of $353 million to the latter, according to a statement.

Intel, however, did not mention the details about the regulatory approvals.

Companies UK's July annual inflation meets expectations

Precious metal miners lead sectoral losses

Non-life insurers gain on Admiral results

Stocks down 0.4%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The UK's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 edged lower on Wednesday after data showed inflation slowed as expected in July, while precious metal miners fell as gold prices came under pressure.

The blue-chip index FTSE 100 (.FTSE) slid 0.4%, extending losses after hitting a one-month low on Tuesday. The index marked its fourth successive daily decline and had its worst run of losses since early July.

Annual consumer price inflation cooled to 6.8% in July from 7.9% in June, its lowest annual rate since February 2022, but still remained elevated.

However, core inflation soured the sentiment as it came in at a hotter-than-expected 6.9% in July, while inflation in services rose to 7.4% from 7.2% in June.

Sterling rose 0.35% to $1.2744 following the data, as the latest UK inflation numbers reinforced bets that the BoE will likely hike interest rates again.

""Today’s figure does buy the government a bit of breathing space while it’s the core (inflation) figure that will keep pressure on the BoE to keep raising interest rates until the sticky tendrils have been eradicated,"" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell in a note.

Traders are betting on an over 89% probability for the UK central bank to hike interest rates by 25 basis points in its September meeting. 0#BOEWATCH

Precious metal miners (.FTNMX551030) fell 2.1%, touching their lowest levels in over seven years, as gold prices hovered near eight-week lows.

The domestically-focused FTSE 250 (.FTMC) fell 0.4%.

Non-life insurers (.FTNMX303020) were the biggest gainers of the session, rising 3.2%, led by a 7.2% jump in Admiral shares (ADML.L), as the British motor and home insurer reported higher half-year profit.

Shares of Aviva (AV.L) rose 0.9%, after the life and general insurer posted a forecast-beating rise in first-half operating profit.

Insurer Direct Line (DLGD.L) also spiked 7.1%, becoming the top gainer on the mid-cap index.

Meanwhile, global infrastructure company Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) was the biggest loser on the index, down 10.6%, hurt by a tech downturn in its U.S. office projects.

Guatemala's presidential run-off will be 'test for democracy',"[1/4] Guatemalan veterans pray during a meeting with Presidential candidate Sandra Torres, of the National Unity of Hope (UNE) political party, ahead of the presidential run-off, in Guatemala City, Guatemala August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Cristina Chiquin Acquire Licensing Rights

GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Guatemalan anti-corruption campaigner is heavily favored to snag the presidency in Sunday's run-off vote, suggesting the country could be heading towards a new era after years of democratic backsliding.

Bernardo Arevalo of the progressive center-left Semilla party, who surprised with a second-place finish in the first-round vote, had a strong lead in a recent opinion poll over his rival, former first lady Sandra Torres of the large, establishment center-left National Unity of Hope (UNE) party.

Arevalo, a 64-year-old ex-diplomat and son of a former president, has survived attempts by prosecutors to bar him from the race, amid increasing international scrutiny of the electoral process and allegations of government interference.

Guatemalans will choose their next president at a crucial moment in which the Central American country is dealing with pervasive insecurity, a poverty rate of more than 55%, record hunger and the region's highest level of migration to the United States.

Arevalo has vowed to investigate wrongdoing, and analysts say that a win for him could see a shake-up of a decades-long status quo in Guatemalan politics, with voters frustrated with corrupt institutions and regular crackdowns on political rivals and journalists.

""This election can be a game-changer. It's a test for Guatemalan democracy,"" said Tamara Taraciuk, Rule of Law program director at the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank.

The campaign period has been wrought with disruptions. The official results of the first-round vote on June 25 were delayed after a challenge by several parties, including that of Torres.

A court then granted a request from Prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche to exclude Semilla from the run-off over allegations the party had illegally affiliated members, including deceased people.

Curruchiche has previously targeted anti-graft campaigners and has been placed on the U.S. State Department's Engel List for ""corrupt and undemocratic actors.""

The country's top court later reversed the suspension amid a flood of international criticism over perceived tampering with the democratic process, though raids and investigations against Semilla have continued.

The Organization of American States (OAS), which has a mission monitoring the elections, has flagged ""clear interference."" OAS chief Luis Almagro said after a visit to Guatemala earlier this month that the presidential campaigns had been influenced by organized crime.

""There are different groups that want to continue with immunity and privileges,"" Almagro said.

Like many fed up Guatemalans, university student Gerson López, 23, is pinning his hopes on Arevalo to deliver change.

""He is a person who does not have a history of being corrupt,"" said Lopez in Guatemala City. ""We need new people and not people who have already been there and have a bad record.""

President Alejandro Giammattei, who cannot seek re-election, has pledged to ensure peaceful elections and transfer power to the winner on Jan. 14. His office declined to comment for this story.

Allegations of political conspiracy are particularly sensitive for Guatemala against the backdrop of a three-decade-long civil conflict ending in 1996 which pitted the political right and left against each other and permanently scarred the country, said Donald J. Planty, former U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala.

""There is, in parts of the establishment, this fear of and bias against the left,"" Planty said.

""All efforts have been aimed at preventing (Arevalo) from running or getting him off the ballot through one nefarious means or another,"" he added.

Support from the private business sector and international community will be critical if and when Arevalo takes office, experts said. He will likely face barriers in carrying out his agenda as Semilla will not hold a majority in Congress, threatening a period of instability.

""It depends on how hard they decide to go after him on the right,"" Planty said. ""The world is watching.""

If Arevalo wins, he could face major opposition even before he is due to take office in January, analysts said.

""There is no indication that the attorney general is planning to change the strategy of going after people who challenge the status quo,"" said Taraciuk of the Inter-American Dialogue. ""Why would they stop now when there's a risk that they may actually be held accountable for what they've done in power?""

SAO PAULO, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A key aide to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Wednesday that there was no contradiction in defending an ecological transition and new oil exploration fronts, in remarks later echoed by the head of oil giant Petrobras (PETR4.SA).

The comments by Lula's chief of staff, Rui Costa, come as state-run Petrobras seeks clearance to drill a well at the mouth of the Amazon River, a controversial topic dividing the leftist leader's own coalition.

""There is no contradiction,"" Costa said in a radio interview. ""It's in the name - it is an ecological and energy transition.""

Last week, Amazon rainforest nations faced divisions over proposals to block new oil drilling as they met for the first time in 14 years in Brazil.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro pushed Lula to block all new oil development in the region, as Brazil weighs whether to develop the potentially huge offshore oil find on the coast of northern Amapa state.

Nigeria plans to create digital jobs for its teeming youth population, Vice President Kashim Shettima told Google Africa executives during a meeting in Abuja. Shettima did not provide a timeline for creating the jobs.

Google Africa executives said a grant from its philanthropic arm in partnership with Data Science Nigeria and the Creative Industry Initiative for Africa will facilitate the programme.

Shettima said Google's initiative aligned with the government's commitment to increase youth participation in the digital economy. The government is also working with the country's banks on the project, Shettima added.

Google director for West Africa Olumide Balogun said the company would commit funds and provide digital skills to women and young people in Nigeria and also enable startups to grow, which will create jobs.

Google is committed to investing in digital infrastructure across Africa, Charles Murito, Google Africa's director of government relations and public policy, said during the meeting, adding that digital transformation can be a job enabler.

""Right now, an opportunity has appeared for Ukrainian grain transportation,"" Rinalds Plavnieks told Latvia's public broadcaster.

The grain would need to be shipped through Poland, which uses a different rail gauge to Latvia and Ukraine, necessitating two changes, which adds to costs.

""We see that around 500,000 to a million tons a year could be transported via this transit corridor,"" Plavnieks added.

Moscow has withdrawn from a deal to allow Black Sea exports of grain from Ukraine, one of the world's top exporters, and has been attacking its agricultural and port infrastructure.

Last month Lithuania asked the European Commission to develop a route for Ukrainian grain through five ports in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The five ports have a combined annual grain export capacity of 25 million tons, the letter said.

Tesla on Monday said it cut prices in China for its Model Y's long-range and performance versions starting on Aug. 14, which triggered concerns around its profit margins.

The moves come after sales of Tesla's China-made vehicles fell 31% in July from June, their first month-on-month decline since December, as the automaker idled some production to prepare for a revamped Model 3 launch.

In contrast, China's BYD (002594.SZ) increased sales from June.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) said on Wednesday it has terminated its plans to acquire Israeli contract chipmaker Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA) as it was unable to get timely regulatory approvals for the $5.4 billion deal.

Intel, which signed a deal to buy Tower last year, will pay a termination fee of $353 million to the latter, according to a statement.

Intel, however, did not mention the details about the regulatory approvals.

Reuters had reported late on Tuesday citing sources that Intel did not secure approval from Chinese regulators for the acquisition on time as required under the contract.

Companies UK's July annual inflation meets expectations

Precious metal miners lead sectoral losses

Non-life insurers gain on Admiral results

Stocks down 0.4%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The UK's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 edged lower on Wednesday after data showed inflation slowed as expected in July, while precious metal miners fell as gold prices came under pressure.

The blue-chip index FTSE 100 (.FTSE) slid 0.4%, extending losses after hitting a one-month low on Tuesday. The index marked its fourth successive daily decline and had its worst run of losses since early July.

Annual consumer price inflation cooled to 6.8% in July from 7.9% in June, its lowest annual rate since February 2022, but still remained elevated.

However, core inflation soured the sentiment as it came in at a hotter-than-expected 6.9% in July, while inflation in services rose to 7.4% from 7.2% in June.

Sterling rose 0.35% to $1.2744 following the data, as the latest UK inflation numbers reinforced bets that the BoE will likely hike interest rates again.

""Today’s figure does buy the government a bit of breathing space while it’s the core (inflation) figure that will keep pressure on the BoE to keep raising interest rates until the sticky tendrils have been eradicated,"" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell in a note.

Traders are betting on an over 89% probability for the UK central bank to hike interest rates by 25 basis points in its September meeting. 0#BOEWATCH

Precious metal miners (.FTNMX551030) fell 2.1%, touching their lowest levels in over seven years, as gold prices hovered near eight-week lows.

The domestically-focused FTSE 250 (.FTMC) fell 0.4%.

Non-life insurers (.FTNMX303020) were the biggest gainers of the session, rising 3.2%, led by a 7.2% jump in Admiral shares (ADML.L), as the British motor and home insurer reported higher half-year profit.

Shares of Aviva (AV.L) rose 0.9%, after the life and general insurer posted a forecast-beating rise in first-half operating profit.

Insurer Direct Line (DLGD.L) also spiked 7.1%, becoming the top gainer on the mid-cap index.

Meanwhile, global infrastructure company Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) was the biggest loser on the index, down 10.6%, hurt by a tech downturn in its U.S. office projects.

Guatemala's presidential run-off will be 'test for democracy',"[1/4] Guatemalan veterans pray during a meeting with Presidential candidate Sandra Torres, of the National Unity of Hope (UNE) political party, ahead of the presidential run-off, in Guatemala City, Guatemala August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Cristina Chiquin Acquire Licensing Rights

GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Guatemalan anti-corruption campaigner is heavily favored to snag the presidency in Sunday's run-off vote, suggesting the country could be heading towards a new era after years of democratic backsliding.

Bernardo Arevalo of the progressive center-left Semilla party, who surprised with a second-place finish in the first-round vote, had a strong lead in a recent opinion poll over his rival, former first lady Sandra Torres of the large, establishment center-left National Unity of Hope (UNE) party.

Arevalo, a 64-year-old ex-diplomat and son of a former president, has survived attempts by prosecutors to bar him from the race, amid increasing international scrutiny of the electoral process and allegations of government interference.

Guatemalans will choose their next president at a crucial moment in which the Central American country is dealing with pervasive insecurity, a poverty rate of more than 55%, record hunger and the region's highest level of migration to the United States.

Arevalo has vowed to investigate wrongdoing, and analysts say that a win for him could see a shake-up of a decades-long status quo in Guatemalan politics, with voters frustrated with corrupt institutions and regular crackdowns on political rivals and journalists.

""This election can be a game-changer. It's a test for Guatemalan democracy,"" said Tamara Taraciuk, Rule of Law program director at the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank.

The campaign period has been wrought with disruptions. The official results of the first-round vote on June 25 were delayed after a challenge by several parties, including that of Torres.

A court then granted a request from Prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche to exclude Semilla from the run-off over allegations the party had illegally affiliated members, including deceased people.

Curruchiche has previously targeted anti-graft campaigners and has been placed on the U.S. State Department's Engel List for ""corrupt and undemocratic actors.""

The country's top court later reversed the suspension amid a flood of international criticism over perceived tampering with the democratic process, though raids and investigations against Semilla have continued.

The Organization of American States (OAS), which has a mission monitoring the elections, has flagged ""clear interference."" OAS chief Luis Almagro said after a visit to Guatemala earlier this month that the presidential campaigns had been influenced by organized crime.

""There are different groups that want to continue with immunity and privileges,"" Almagro said.

Like many fed up Guatemalans, university student Gerson López, 23, is pinning his hopes on Arevalo to deliver change.

""He is a person who does not have a history of being corrupt,"" said Lopez in Guatemala City. ""We need new people and not people who have already been there and have a bad record.""

President Alejandro Giammattei, who cannot seek re-election, has pledged to ensure peaceful elections and transfer power to the winner on Jan. 14. His office declined to comment for this story.

Allegations of political conspiracy are particularly sensitive for Guatemala against the backdrop of a three-decade-long civil conflict ending in 1996 which pitted the political right and left against each other and permanently scarred the country, said Donald J. Planty, former U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala.

""There is, in parts of the establishment, this fear of and bias against the left,"" Planty said.

""All efforts have been aimed at preventing (Arevalo) from running or getting him off the ballot through one nefarious means or another,"" he added.

Support from the private business sector and international community will be critical if and when Arevalo takes office, experts said. He will likely face barriers in carrying out his agenda as Semilla will not hold a majority in Congress, threatening a period of instability.

""It depends on how hard they decide to go after him on the right,"" Planty said. ""The world is watching.""

If Arevalo wins, he could face major opposition even before he is due to take office in January, analysts said.

""There is no indication that the attorney general is planning to change the strategy of going after people who challenge the status quo,"" said Taraciuk of the Inter-American Dialogue. ""Why would they stop now when there's a risk that they may actually be held accountable for what they've done in power?""

Exclusive: Silver Lake to explore sale of tax-free shopping firm Global Blue -sources,"Aug 15 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Silver Lake is preparing to explore a sale of Global Blue Group Holdings Ltd (GB.N), a company that enables retailers to offer tax-free shopping, after receiving expressions of interest from potential acquirers, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The deliberations come as Global Blue recovers from the air travel slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which weighed on duty-free shopping. It still faces headwinds, including price inflation and the prospect of an economic recession in Europe, which the company says it can tackle.

Silver Lake has hired an investment bank to explore options for Global Blue, which include a sale or capital market transactions, the sources said. Other companies and private equity firms have shown interest in acquiring Global Blue, the sources added.

The sources cautioned that a deal isn't certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Silver Lake declined to comment, while Global Blue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Global Blue's shares rose 9.2% in afternoon trading in New York on Tuesday to $4.99, giving the company a market value of about $1 billion. The company had net debt of 550 million euros ($600 million) as of the end of March.

Headquartered in Signy, Switzerland, Global Blue provides technology that reimburses retailers for making shopping tax-free for consumers. It serves more than 400,000 merchant stores in over 50 countries.

Silver Lake owns more than two-thirds of Global Blue after acquiring it in a 1-billion-euro deal in 2012 and then merging it with a blank-check acquisition company sponsored by Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC in 2020 at a $2.6 billion valuation.

Global Blue reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 78 million euros in the 12 months to the end of March, compared to a 9.9 million euro loss in the previous 12 months, as it benefited from the travel industry's recovery. It has said it expects the bounce-back to continue as China reopens its travel.

KYIV, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A container ship left the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa on Wednesday morning, the government said, using what it has described as a new temporary corridor for merchant ships to and from its ports, which are blockaded by Russia.

Ukraine last week announced a ""humanitarian corridor"" in the Black Sea to release cargo ships that have been trapped in its ports since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. read more

Moscow has not indicated whether it would respect the shipping corridor, and shipping and insurance sources have expressed concerns about safety.

""A first vessel used the temporary corridor for merchant ships to/from the ports of Big Odesa,"" Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Facebook.

He identified the container ship as the Hong-Kong-flagged JOSEPH SCHULTE and said it had been in the port since Feb. 23, 2022, the day before the invasion.

He said the ship was carrying more than 30,000 metric tons of cargo in 2,114 containers.

""The corridor will be primarily used to evacuate ships that were in the Ukrainian ports (Chornomorsk, Odesa and Pivdennyi) at the time of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation,"" the deputy prime minister said.

Last month Lithuania asked the European Commission to develop a route for Ukrainian grain through five ports in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The five ports have a combined annual grain export capacity of 25 million tons, the letter said.

Tesla on Monday said it cut prices in China for its Model Y's long-range and performance versions starting on Aug. 14, which triggered concerns around its profit margins.

The moves come after sales of Tesla's China-made vehicles fell 31% in July from June, their first month-on-month decline since December, as the automaker idled some production to prepare for a revamped Model 3 launch.

In contrast, China's BYD (002594.SZ) increased sales from June.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) said on Wednesday it has terminated its plans to acquire Israeli contract chipmaker Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA) as it was unable to get timely regulatory approvals for the $5.4 billion deal.

Intel, which signed a deal to buy Tower last year, will pay a termination fee of $353 million to the latter, according to a statement.

Intel, however, did not mention the details about the regulatory approvals.

Reuters had reported late on Tuesday citing sources that Intel did not secure approval from Chinese regulators for the acquisition on time as required under the contract.

Companies UK's July annual inflation meets expectations

Precious metal miners lead sectoral losses

Non-life insurers gain on Admiral results

Stocks down 0.4%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The UK's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 edged lower on Wednesday after data showed inflation slowed as expected in July, while precious metal miners fell as gold prices came under pressure.

The blue-chip index FTSE 100 (.FTSE) slid 0.4%, extending losses after hitting a one-month low on Tuesday. The index marked its fourth successive daily decline and had its worst run of losses since early July.

Annual consumer price inflation cooled to 6.8% in July from 7.9% in June, its lowest annual rate since February 2022, but still remained elevated.

However, core inflation soured the sentiment as it came in at a hotter-than-expected 6.9% in July, while inflation in services rose to 7.4% from 7.2% in June.

Sterling rose 0.35% to $1.2744 following the data, as the latest UK inflation numbers reinforced bets that the BoE will likely hike interest rates again.

""Today’s figure does buy the government a bit of breathing space while it’s the core (inflation) figure that will keep pressure on the BoE to keep raising interest rates until the sticky tendrils have been eradicated,"" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell in a note.

Traders are betting on an over 89% probability for the UK central bank to hike interest rates by 25 basis points in its September meeting. 0#BOEWATCH

Precious metal miners (.FTNMX551030) fell 2.1%, touching their lowest levels in over seven years, as gold prices hovered near eight-week lows.

The domestically-focused FTSE 250 (.FTMC) fell 0.4%.

Non-life insurers (.FTNMX303020) were the biggest gainers of the session, rising 3.2%, led by a 7.2% jump in Admiral shares (ADML.L), as the British motor and home insurer reported higher half-year profit.

Shares of Aviva (AV.L) rose 0.9%, after the life and general insurer posted a forecast-beating rise in first-half operating profit.

Insurer Direct Line (DLGD.L) also spiked 7.1%, becoming the top gainer on the mid-cap index.

Meanwhile, global infrastructure company Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) was the biggest loser on the index, down 10.6%, hurt by a tech downturn in its U.S. office projects.

Guatemala's presidential run-off will be 'test for democracy',"[1/4] Guatemalan veterans pray during a meeting with Presidential candidate Sandra Torres, of the National Unity of Hope (UNE) political party, ahead of the presidential run-off, in Guatemala City, Guatemala August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Cristina Chiquin Acquire Licensing Rights

GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Guatemalan anti-corruption campaigner is heavily favored to snag the presidency in Sunday's run-off vote, suggesting the country could be heading towards a new era after years of democratic backsliding.

Bernardo Arevalo of the progressive center-left Semilla party, who surprised with a second-place finish in the first-round vote, had a strong lead in a recent opinion poll over his rival, former first lady Sandra Torres of the large, establishment center-left National Unity of Hope (UNE) party.

Arevalo, a 64-year-old ex-diplomat and son of a former president, has survived attempts by prosecutors to bar him from the race, amid increasing international scrutiny of the electoral process and allegations of government interference.

Guatemalans will choose their next president at a crucial moment in which the Central American country is dealing with pervasive insecurity, a poverty rate of more than 55%, record hunger and the region's highest level of migration to the United States.

Arevalo has vowed to investigate wrongdoing, and analysts say that a win for him could see a shake-up of a decades-long status quo in Guatemalan politics, with voters frustrated with corrupt institutions and regular crackdowns on political rivals and journalists.

""This election can be a game-changer. It's a test for Guatemalan democracy,"" said Tamara Taraciuk, Rule of Law program director at the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank.

The campaign period has been wrought with disruptions. The official results of the first-round vote on June 25 were delayed after a challenge by several parties, including that of Torres.

A court then granted a request from Prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche to exclude Semilla from the run-off over allegations the party had illegally affiliated members, including deceased people.

Curruchiche has previously targeted anti-graft campaigners and has been placed on the U.S. State Department's Engel List for ""corrupt and undemocratic actors.""

The country's top court later reversed the suspension amid a flood of international criticism over perceived tampering with the democratic process, though raids and investigations against Semilla have continued.

The Organization of American States (OAS), which has a mission monitoring the elections, has flagged ""clear interference."" OAS chief Luis Almagro said after a visit to Guatemala earlier this month that the presidential campaigns had been influenced by organized crime.

""There are different groups that want to continue with immunity and privileges,"" Almagro said.

Like many fed up Guatemalans, university student Gerson López, 23, is pinning his hopes on Arevalo to deliver change.

""He is a person who does not have a history of being corrupt,"" said Lopez in Guatemala City. ""We need new people and not people who have already been there and have a bad record.""

President Alejandro Giammattei, who cannot seek re-election, has pledged to ensure peaceful elections and transfer power to the winner on Jan. 14. His office declined to comment for this story.

Allegations of political conspiracy are particularly sensitive for Guatemala against the backdrop of a three-decade-long civil conflict ending in 1996 which pitted the political right and left against each other and permanently scarred the country, said Donald J. Planty, former U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala.

""There is, in parts of the establishment, this fear of and bias against the left,"" Planty said.

""All efforts have been aimed at preventing (Arevalo) from running or getting him off the ballot through one nefarious means or another,"" he added.

Support from the private business sector and international community will be critical if and when Arevalo takes office, experts said. He will likely face barriers in carrying out his agenda as Semilla will not hold a majority in Congress, threatening a period of instability.

""It depends on how hard they decide to go after him on the right,"" Planty said. ""The world is watching.""

If Arevalo wins, he could face major opposition even before he is due to take office in January, analysts said.

""There is no indication that the attorney general is planning to change the strategy of going after people who challenge the status quo,"" said Taraciuk of the Inter-American Dialogue. ""Why would they stop now when there's a risk that they may actually be held accountable for what they've done in power?""

Exclusive: Silver Lake to explore sale of tax-free shopping firm Global Blue -sources,"Aug 15 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Silver Lake is preparing to explore a sale of Global Blue Group Holdings Ltd (GB.N), a company that enables retailers to offer tax-free shopping, after receiving expressions of interest from potential acquirers, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The deliberations come as Global Blue recovers from the air travel slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which weighed on duty-free shopping. It still faces headwinds, including price inflation and the prospect of an economic recession in Europe, which the company says it can tackle.

Silver Lake has hired an investment bank to explore options for Global Blue, which include a sale or capital market transactions, the sources said. Other companies and private equity firms have shown interest in acquiring Global Blue, the sources added.

The sources cautioned that a deal isn't certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Silver Lake declined to comment, while Global Blue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Global Blue's shares rose 9.2% in afternoon trading in New York on Tuesday to $4.99, giving the company a market value of about $1 billion. The company had net debt of 550 million euros ($600 million) as of the end of March.

Headquartered in Signy, Switzerland, Global Blue provides technology that reimburses retailers for making shopping tax-free for consumers. It serves more than 400,000 merchant stores in over 50 countries.

Silver Lake owns more than two-thirds of Global Blue after acquiring it in a 1-billion-euro deal in 2012 and then merging it with a blank-check acquisition company sponsored by Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC in 2020 at a $2.6 billion valuation.

Global Blue reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 78 million euros in the 12 months to the end of March, compared to a 9.9 million euro loss in the previous 12 months, as it benefited from the travel industry's recovery. It has said it expects the bounce-back to continue as China reopens its travel.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said on Wednesday it would expand its flight schedule to China later this year, as the carrier looks to capitalize on strong travel demand in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Biden administration had said last week U.S. and China would approve twice the number of passenger flights currently permitted for air carriers to fly between the two countries.

The carrier said it would offer 10 weekly flights to Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from its Seattle (SEA) and Detroit (DTW) hubs.

""Beginning October 29, the airline will operate daily flights from SEA and three-times-weekly service from DTW,"" Delta said in a statement.

Delta added that customers flying with the carrier would be able to connect to other cities within China via its partnership with China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS).

China fast encroaching on Germany's share of EU markets - study,"BERLIN, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Chinese manufacturers are increasingly giving German manufacturers a run for their money in their home European Union market, especially in the field of advanced industrial goods where Germany is a leader.

A study by the employers' economic think tank IW found that in some sectors China's share of EU imports had risen as much as or more in the two years to 2022 as they had in the preceding decade, prompting the think tank to warn that there was a risk of Germany's economic motor stalling.

After years of growth, Germany's economy entered recession in May as its champion exporters were battered by supply chain woes, inflation and rising energy costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting much soul-searching on the industrial future of Europe's economic powerhouse.

""These findings give cause to worry given the challenges of the energy change and problems with Germany's competitiveness,"" said researcher Juergen Matthes.

Among the challenges the study listed was the role played by Chinese state subsidies in many sectors where Chinese companies were taking an increasing EU market share, and while high energy costs following the loss of Russian gas were weakening energy-intensive sectors like chemicals.

High energy costs were also a drag on automotive exports at a time when Chinese e-vehicle makers were starting to conquer the European market, Matthes added.

LONDON/WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street opened in mixed territory Wednesday while the dollar slid slightly, as investors weighed concerns over China's economy while awaiting Federal Reserve meeting minutes later in the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was up 0.31% in earlier trading, and the S&P 500 (.SPX) was basically flat, up just 0.03%. The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dipped 0.3%.

The tepid open came after declines in European and Asian stock markets. The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 45 nations, was down 0.27%.

""Much of the decline is explained by continuing concerns surrounding the economic slowdown in China, as well as rising tensions with the U.S.,"" said Thomas Gehlen, senior market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros.

China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, data showed on Wednesday.

The Chinese central bank lowered its policy rate on Tuesday, after a long run of weak figures, but investors have so far been unimpressed by the response.

News that a leading Chinese trust firm has missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month added to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact.

In currency markets, sterling picked up after data showed that Britain's inflation fell in July but the core measure came in slightly higher than expected. It was last up 0.39% at $1.275.

The dollar index , which measures the currency against six major peers, was down 0.1% at 103.14, ending a run of four straight daily increases.

Investors have bought the safe-haven dollar on the back of strong U.S. economic data and rising concerns about China.

Markets will get a sense of the Fed's thinking on interest rates at 1800 GMT (2 p.m. ET), when the minutes from July's decision are released. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points to a 5.25% to 5.5% range at the meeting.

According to pricing in derivatives markets, traders think the Fed has probably finished raising rates.

""While the Fed prefers to retain optionality given lingering uncertainties about the macro outlook, we continue to believe that July's was the last rate hike of the tightening cycle. In effect, we expect the minutes to reflect policy discussions among Fed officials are already entertaining the possibility of pausing going forward,"" said TD Securities analysts in a note.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 4.199% on Wednesday, after hitting a more than nine-month high of 4.274% in the previous session.

U.S. crude oil and Brent crude both rebounded slightly after a Tuesday selloff, climbing 0.16% and 0.1%, respectively.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) said on Wednesday it has terminated its plans to acquire Israeli contract chipmaker Tower Semiconductor (TSEM.TA) as it was unable to get timely regulatory approvals for the $5.4 billion deal.

Intel, which signed a deal to buy Tower last year, will pay a termination fee of $353 million to the latter, according to a statement.

Intel, however, did not mention the details about the regulatory approvals.

Reuters had reported late on Tuesday citing sources that Intel did not secure approval from Chinese regulators for the acquisition on time as required under the contract.

Companies UK's July annual inflation meets expectations

Precious metal miners lead sectoral losses

Non-life insurers gain on Admiral results

Stocks down 0.4%

Aug 16 (Reuters) - The UK's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 edged lower on Wednesday after data showed inflation slowed as expected in July, while precious metal miners fell as gold prices came under pressure.

The blue-chip index FTSE 100 (.FTSE) slid 0.4%, extending losses after hitting a one-month low on Tuesday. The index marked its fourth successive daily decline and had its worst run of losses since early July.

Annual consumer price inflation cooled to 6.8% in July from 7.9% in June, its lowest annual rate since February 2022, but still remained elevated.

However, core inflation soured the sentiment as it came in at a hotter-than-expected 6.9% in July, while inflation in services rose to 7.4% from 7.2% in June.

Sterling rose 0.35% to $1.2744 following the data, as the latest UK inflation numbers reinforced bets that the BoE will likely hike interest rates again.

""Today’s figure does buy the government a bit of breathing space while it’s the core (inflation) figure that will keep pressure on the BoE to keep raising interest rates until the sticky tendrils have been eradicated,"" said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell in a note.

Traders are betting on an over 89% probability for the UK central bank to hike interest rates by 25 basis points in its September meeting. 0#BOEWATCH

Precious metal miners (.FTNMX551030) fell 2.1%, touching their lowest levels in over seven years, as gold prices hovered near eight-week lows.

The domestically-focused FTSE 250 (.FTMC) fell 0.4%.

Non-life insurers (.FTNMX303020) were the biggest gainers of the session, rising 3.2%, led by a 7.2% jump in Admiral shares (ADML.L), as the British motor and home insurer reported higher half-year profit.

Shares of Aviva (AV.L) rose 0.9%, after the life and general insurer posted a forecast-beating rise in first-half operating profit.

Insurer Direct Line (DLGD.L) also spiked 7.1%, becoming the top gainer on the mid-cap index.

Meanwhile, global infrastructure company Balfour Beatty (BALF.L) was the biggest loser on the index, down 10.6%, hurt by a tech downturn in its U.S. office projects.

Guatemala's presidential run-off will be 'test for democracy',"[1/4] Guatemalan veterans pray during a meeting with Presidential candidate Sandra Torres, of the National Unity of Hope (UNE) political party, ahead of the presidential run-off, in Guatemala City, Guatemala August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Cristina Chiquin Acquire Licensing Rights

GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Guatemalan anti-corruption campaigner is heavily favored to snag the presidency in Sunday's run-off vote, suggesting the country could be heading towards a new era after years of democratic backsliding.

Bernardo Arevalo of the progressive center-left Semilla party, who surprised with a second-place finish in the first-round vote, had a strong lead in a recent opinion poll over his rival, former first lady Sandra Torres of the large, establishment center-left National Unity of Hope (UNE) party.

Arevalo, a 64-year-old ex-diplomat and son of a former president, has survived attempts by prosecutors to bar him from the race, amid increasing international scrutiny of the electoral process and allegations of government interference.

Guatemalans will choose their next president at a crucial moment in which the Central American country is dealing with pervasive insecurity, a poverty rate of more than 55%, record hunger and the region's highest level of migration to the United States.

Arevalo has vowed to investigate wrongdoing, and analysts say that a win for him could see a shake-up of a decades-long status quo in Guatemalan politics, with voters frustrated with corrupt institutions and regular crackdowns on political rivals and journalists.

""This election can be a game-changer. It's a test for Guatemalan democracy,"" said Tamara Taraciuk, Rule of Law program director at the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank.

The campaign period has been wrought with disruptions. The official results of the first-round vote on June 25 were delayed after a challenge by several parties, including that of Torres.

A court then granted a request from Prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche to exclude Semilla from the run-off over allegations the party had illegally affiliated members, including deceased people.

Curruchiche has previously targeted anti-graft campaigners and has been placed on the U.S. State Department's Engel List for ""corrupt and undemocratic actors.""

The country's top court later reversed the suspension amid a flood of international criticism over perceived tampering with the democratic process, though raids and investigations against Semilla have continued.

The Organization of American States (OAS), which has a mission monitoring the elections, has flagged ""clear interference."" OAS chief Luis Almagro said after a visit to Guatemala earlier this month that the presidential campaigns had been influenced by organized crime.

""There are different groups that want to continue with immunity and privileges,"" Almagro said.

Like many fed up Guatemalans, university student Gerson López, 23, is pinning his hopes on Arevalo to deliver change.

""He is a person who does not have a history of being corrupt,"" said Lopez in Guatemala City. ""We need new people and not people who have already been there and have a bad record.""

President Alejandro Giammattei, who cannot seek re-election, has pledged to ensure peaceful elections and transfer power to the winner on Jan. 14. His office declined to comment for this story.

Allegations of political conspiracy are particularly sensitive for Guatemala against the backdrop of a three-decade-long civil conflict ending in 1996 which pitted the political right and left against each other and permanently scarred the country, said Donald J. Planty, former U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala.

""There is, in parts of the establishment, this fear of and bias against the left,"" Planty said.

""All efforts have been aimed at preventing (Arevalo) from running or getting him off the ballot through one nefarious means or another,"" he added.

Support from the private business sector and international community will be critical if and when Arevalo takes office, experts said. He will likely face barriers in carrying out his agenda as Semilla will not hold a majority in Congress, threatening a period of instability.

""It depends on how hard they decide to go after him on the right,"" Planty said. ""The world is watching.""

If Arevalo wins, he could face major opposition even before he is due to take office in January, analysts said.

""There is no indication that the attorney general is planning to change the strategy of going after people who challenge the status quo,"" said Taraciuk of the Inter-American Dialogue. ""Why would they stop now when there's a risk that they may actually be held accountable for what they've done in power?""

ABUJA, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Google plans to train 20,000 Nigerian women and youth in digital skills and provide a grant of 1.2 billion naira ($1.6 million) to help the government's create one million digital jobs in the country, its Africa executives said on Tuesday.

Nigeria plans to create digital jobs for its teeming youth population, Vice President Kashim Shettima told Google Africa executives during a meeting in Abuja. Shettima did not provide a timeline for creating the jobs.

Google Africa executives said a grant from its philanthropic arm in partnership with Data Science Nigeria and the Creative Industry Initiative for Africa will facilitate the programme.

Shettima said Google's initiative aligned with the government's commitment to increase youth participation in the digital economy. The government is also working with the country's banks on the project, Shettima added.

Google director for West Africa Olumide Balogun said the company would commit funds and provide digital skills to women and young people in Nigeria and also enable startups to grow, which will create jobs.

Google is committed to investing in digital infrastructure across Africa, Charles Murito, Google Africa's director of government relations and public policy, said during the meeting, adding that digital transformation can be a job enabler.

Exclusive: Silver Lake to explore sale of tax-free shopping firm Global Blue -sources,"Aug 15 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Silver Lake is preparing to explore a sale of Global Blue Group Holdings Ltd (GB.N), a company that enables retailers to offer tax-free shopping, after receiving expressions of interest from potential acquirers, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The deliberations come as Global Blue recovers from the air travel slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which weighed on duty-free shopping. It still faces headwinds, including price inflation and the prospect of an economic recession in Europe, which the company says it can tackle.

Silver Lake has hired an investment bank to explore options for Global Blue, which include a sale or capital market transactions, the sources said. Other companies and private equity firms have shown interest in acquiring Global Blue, the sources added.

The sources cautioned that a deal isn't certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Silver Lake declined to comment, while Global Blue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Global Blue's shares rose 9.2% in afternoon trading in New York on Tuesday to $4.99, giving the company a market value of about $1 billion. The company had net debt of 550 million euros ($600 million) as of the end of March.

Headquartered in Signy, Switzerland, Global Blue provides technology that reimburses retailers for making shopping tax-free for consumers. It serves more than 400,000 merchant stores in over 50 countries.

Silver Lake owns more than two-thirds of Global Blue after acquiring it in a 1-billion-euro deal in 2012 and then merging it with a blank-check acquisition company sponsored by Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC in 2020 at a $2.6 billion valuation.

Global Blue reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 78 million euros in the 12 months to the end of March, compared to a 9.9 million euro loss in the previous 12 months, as it benefited from the travel industry's recovery. It has said it expects the bounce-back to continue as China reopens its travel.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said on Wednesday it would expand its flight schedule to China later this year, as the carrier looks to capitalize on strong travel demand in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Biden administration had said last week U.S. and China would approve twice the number of passenger flights currently permitted for air carriers to fly between the two countries.

The carrier said it would offer 10 weekly flights to Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from its Seattle (SEA) and Detroit (DTW) hubs.

""Beginning October 29, the airline will operate daily flights from SEA and three-times-weekly service from DTW,"" Delta said in a statement.

Delta added that customers flying with the carrier would be able to connect to other cities within China via its partnership with China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS).

China fast encroaching on Germany's share of EU markets - study,"BERLIN, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Chinese manufacturers are increasingly giving German manufacturers a run for their money in their home European Union market, especially in the field of advanced industrial goods where Germany is a leader.

A study by the employers' economic think tank IW found that in some sectors China's share of EU imports had risen as much as or more in the two years to 2022 as they had in the preceding decade, prompting the think tank to warn that there was a risk of Germany's economic motor stalling.

After years of growth, Germany's economy entered recession in May as its champion exporters were battered by supply chain woes, inflation and rising energy costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting much soul-searching on the industrial future of Europe's economic powerhouse.

""These findings give cause to worry given the challenges of the energy change and problems with Germany's competitiveness,"" said researcher Juergen Matthes.

Among the challenges the study listed was the role played by Chinese state subsidies in many sectors where Chinese companies were taking an increasing EU market share, and while high energy costs following the loss of Russian gas were weakening energy-intensive sectors like chemicals.

High energy costs were also a drag on automotive exports at a time when Chinese e-vehicle makers were starting to conquer the European market, Matthes added.

""Beginning October 29, the airline will operate daily flights from SEA and three-times-weekly service from DTW,"" Delta said in a statement.

Delta added that customers flying with the carrier would be able to connect to other cities within China via its partnership with China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS).

China fast encroaching on Germany's share of EU markets - study,"BERLIN, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Chinese manufacturers are increasingly giving German manufacturers a run for their money in their home European Union market, especially in the field of advanced industrial goods where Germany is a leader.

A study by the employers' economic think tank IW found that in some sectors China's share of EU imports had risen as much as or more in the two years to 2022 as they had in the preceding decade, prompting the think tank to warn that there was a risk of Germany's economic motor stalling.

After years of growth, Germany's economy entered recession in May as its champion exporters were battered by supply chain woes, inflation and rising energy costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting much soul-searching on the industrial future of Europe's economic powerhouse.

""These findings give cause to worry given the challenges of the energy change and problems with Germany's competitiveness,"" said researcher Juergen Matthes.

Among the challenges the study listed was the role played by Chinese state subsidies in many sectors where Chinese companies were taking an increasing EU market share, and while high energy costs following the loss of Russian gas were weakening energy-intensive sectors like chemicals.

High energy costs were also a drag on automotive exports at a time when Chinese e-vehicle makers were starting to conquer the European market, Matthes added.

Federal Reserve to release meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon

LONDON/WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street opened in mixed territory Wednesday while the dollar slid slightly, as investors weighed concerns over China's economy while awaiting Federal Reserve meeting minutes later in the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was up 0.31% in earlier trading, and the S&P 500 (.SPX) was basically flat, up just 0.03%. The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dipped 0.3%.

The tepid open came after declines in European and Asian stock markets. The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 45 nations, was down 0.27%.

""Much of the decline is explained by continuing concerns surrounding the economic slowdown in China, as well as rising tensions with the U.S.,"" said Thomas Gehlen, senior market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros.

China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, data showed on Wednesday.

The Chinese central bank lowered its policy rate on Tuesday, after a long run of weak figures, but investors have so far been unimpressed by the response.

News that a leading Chinese trust firm has missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month added to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact.

In currency markets, sterling picked up after data showed that Britain's inflation fell in July but the core measure came in slightly higher than expected. It was last up 0.39% at $1.275.

The dollar index , which measures the currency against six major peers, was down 0.1% at 103.14, ending a run of four straight daily increases.

Investors have bought the safe-haven dollar on the back of strong U.S. economic data and rising concerns about China.

Markets will get a sense of the Fed's thinking on interest rates at 1800 GMT (2 p.m. ET), when the minutes from July's decision are released. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points to a 5.25% to 5.5% range at the meeting.

According to pricing in derivatives markets, traders think the Fed has probably finished raising rates.

""While the Fed prefers to retain optionality given lingering uncertainties about the macro outlook, we continue to believe that July's was the last rate hike of the tightening cycle. In effect, we expect the minutes to reflect policy discussions among Fed officials are already entertaining the possibility of pausing going forward,"" said TD Securities analysts in a note.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 4.199% on Wednesday, after hitting a more than nine-month high of 4.274% in the previous session.

U.S. crude oil and Brent crude both rebounded slightly after a Tuesday selloff, climbing 0.16% and 0.1%, respectively.

HELSINKI, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said on Wednesday that he will be a candidate in Finland's presidential election due in January of 2024.

His announcement came after incumbent premier Petteri Orpo on Sunday asked Stubb to become the National Coalition party's candidate.

""In this geopolitical situation the answer is unequivocal: when the fatherland calls, then we go,"" Stubb told reporters.

Stubb, currently a professor and director of the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, held several ministerial posts before serving as prime minister between 2014 and 2015.

Among those who have announced their candidacies for the presidential election are Finland's former foreign minister Pekka Haavisto, academic Mika Aaltola and Bank of Finland governor Olli Rehn.

Guatemala's presidential run-off will be 'test for democracy',"[1/4] Guatemalan veterans pray during a meeting with Presidential candidate Sandra Torres, of the National Unity of Hope (UNE) political party, ahead of the presidential run-off, in Guatemala City, Guatemala August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Cristina Chiquin Acquire Licensing Rights

GUATEMALA CITY, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A Guatemalan anti-corruption campaigner is heavily favored to snag the presidency in Sunday's run-off vote, suggesting the country could be heading towards a new era after years of democratic backsliding.

Bernardo Arevalo of the progressive center-left Semilla party, who surprised with a second-place finish in the first-round vote, had a strong lead in a recent opinion poll over his rival, former first lady Sandra Torres of the large, establishment center-left National Unity of Hope (UNE) party.

Arevalo, a 64-year-old ex-diplomat and son of a former president, has survived attempts by prosecutors to bar him from the race, amid increasing international scrutiny of the electoral process and allegations of government interference.

Guatemalans will choose their next president at a crucial moment in which the Central American country is dealing with pervasive insecurity, a poverty rate of more than 55%, record hunger and the region's highest level of migration to the United States.

Arevalo has vowed to investigate wrongdoing, and analysts say that a win for him could see a shake-up of a decades-long status quo in Guatemalan politics, with voters frustrated with corrupt institutions and regular crackdowns on political rivals and journalists.

""This election can be a game-changer. It's a test for Guatemalan democracy,"" said Tamara Taraciuk, Rule of Law program director at the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank.

The campaign period has been wrought with disruptions. The official results of the first-round vote on June 25 were delayed after a challenge by several parties, including that of Torres.

A court then granted a request from Prosecutor Rafael Curruchiche to exclude Semilla from the run-off over allegations the party had illegally affiliated members, including deceased people.

Curruchiche has previously targeted anti-graft campaigners and has been placed on the U.S. State Department's Engel List for ""corrupt and undemocratic actors.""

The country's top court later reversed the suspension amid a flood of international criticism over perceived tampering with the democratic process, though raids and investigations against Semilla have continued.

The Organization of American States (OAS), which has a mission monitoring the elections, has flagged ""clear interference."" OAS chief Luis Almagro said after a visit to Guatemala earlier this month that the presidential campaigns had been influenced by organized crime.

""There are different groups that want to continue with immunity and privileges,"" Almagro said.

Like many fed up Guatemalans, university student Gerson López, 23, is pinning his hopes on Arevalo to deliver change.

""He is a person who does not have a history of being corrupt,"" said Lopez in Guatemala City. ""We need new people and not people who have already been there and have a bad record.""

President Alejandro Giammattei, who cannot seek re-election, has pledged to ensure peaceful elections and transfer power to the winner on Jan. 14. His office declined to comment for this story.

Allegations of political conspiracy are particularly sensitive for Guatemala against the backdrop of a three-decade-long civil conflict ending in 1996 which pitted the political right and left against each other and permanently scarred the country, said Donald J. Planty, former U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala.

""There is, in parts of the establishment, this fear of and bias against the left,"" Planty said.

""All efforts have been aimed at preventing (Arevalo) from running or getting him off the ballot through one nefarious means or another,"" he added.

Support from the private business sector and international community will be critical if and when Arevalo takes office, experts said. He will likely face barriers in carrying out his agenda as Semilla will not hold a majority in Congress, threatening a period of instability.

""It depends on how hard they decide to go after him on the right,"" Planty said. ""The world is watching.""

If Arevalo wins, he could face major opposition even before he is due to take office in January, analysts said.

""There is no indication that the attorney general is planning to change the strategy of going after people who challenge the status quo,"" said Taraciuk of the Inter-American Dialogue. ""Why would they stop now when there's a risk that they may actually be held accountable for what they've done in power?""

Exclusive: Silver Lake to explore sale of tax-free shopping firm Global Blue -sources,"Aug 15 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Silver Lake is preparing to explore a sale of Global Blue Group Holdings Ltd (GB.N), a company that enables retailers to offer tax-free shopping, after receiving expressions of interest from potential acquirers, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The deliberations come as Global Blue recovers from the air travel slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which weighed on duty-free shopping. It still faces headwinds, including price inflation and the prospect of an economic recession in Europe, which the company says it can tackle.

Silver Lake has hired an investment bank to explore options for Global Blue, which include a sale or capital market transactions, the sources said. Other companies and private equity firms have shown interest in acquiring Global Blue, the sources added.

The sources cautioned that a deal isn't certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Silver Lake declined to comment, while Global Blue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Global Blue's shares rose 9.2% in afternoon trading in New York on Tuesday to $4.99, giving the company a market value of about $1 billion. The company had net debt of 550 million euros ($600 million) as of the end of March.

Headquartered in Signy, Switzerland, Global Blue provides technology that reimburses retailers for making shopping tax-free for consumers. It serves more than 400,000 merchant stores in over 50 countries.

Silver Lake owns more than two-thirds of Global Blue after acquiring it in a 1-billion-euro deal in 2012 and then merging it with a blank-check acquisition company sponsored by Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC in 2020 at a $2.6 billion valuation.

Global Blue reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 78 million euros in the 12 months to the end of March, compared to a 9.9 million euro loss in the previous 12 months, as it benefited from the travel industry's recovery. It has said it expects the bounce-back to continue as China reopens its travel.

Exports constituted 4.4% of Mahindra's total sales in the financial year ended March 31, 2023.

On Tuesday, Mahindra launched three new tractors in Cape Town, South Africa. The company is planning to introduce tractors from the new Oja platform in various locations including North America, ASEAN countries, Brazil, Australia, Europe, and the SAARC region.

MUMBAI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - India's largest tractor maker, Mahindra and Mahindra (MAHM.NS), launched a new platform to manufacture lightweight tractors on Tuesday, which would enable the company to double its exports within three years, a senior company official told Reuters.

The new platform, named Oja, was developed in collaboration with India's Mahindra Research Valley and Japan's Mitsubishi Mahindra Agriculture Machinery with an investment of 12 billion rupees ($144 million), Hemant Sikka, president of farm equipment sector at Mahindra said.

""Our aim is that with the launch of Oja, we will double our export in the next three years. So we want to increase exports from 18,000 to 36,000 in about three years,"" he said.

Exports constituted 4.4% of Mahindra's total sales in the financial year ended March 31, 2023.

On Tuesday, Mahindra launched three new tractors in Cape Town, South Africa. The company is planning to introduce tractors from the new Oja platform in various locations including North America, ASEAN countries, Brazil, Australia, Europe, and the SAARC region.

BENGALURU, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Indian software services exporter Infosys (INFY.NS) and Liberty Global (LBTYA.O) have signed a 1.5 billion euro ($1.64 billion) agreement to evolve and scale the communications firm's digital entertainment and connectivity platforms, the companies said.

The 5-year agreement, which has an option to be extended to 8 years and beyond, will have Infosys taking over the operations of the UK-headquartered company's entertainment and connectivity platforms, with its AI offering Infosys Topaz, the companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

""This will potentially enable millions of new customers, around the world, to experience next-generation digital entertainment and connectivity services through Horizon for the first time.""

Infosys will provide services worth 2.3 billion euros if the contract is extended to 8 years, and the collaboration will allow Liberty Global to realize run-rate savings in excess of 100 million euros per annum, according to the details outlined in the statement.

The order comes at a time when curtailed client spending amid macroeconomic uncertainties and recession fears have prompted Indian IT service firms to project muted growth, including Infosys, which in July, halved its full-year revenue forecast.

Last month, Infosys signed a five year AI deal with $2 billion target spend with a client whose name it did not disclose.

Exclusive: Silver Lake to explore sale of tax-free shopping firm Global Blue -sources,"Aug 15 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Silver Lake is preparing to explore a sale of Global Blue Group Holdings Ltd (GB.N), a company that enables retailers to offer tax-free shopping, after receiving expressions of interest from potential acquirers, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The deliberations come as Global Blue recovers from the air travel slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which weighed on duty-free shopping. It still faces headwinds, including price inflation and the prospect of an economic recession in Europe, which the company says it can tackle.

Silver Lake has hired an investment bank to explore options for Global Blue, which include a sale or capital market transactions, the sources said. Other companies and private equity firms have shown interest in acquiring Global Blue, the sources added.

The sources cautioned that a deal isn't certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Silver Lake declined to comment, while Global Blue did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Global Blue's shares rose 9.2% in afternoon trading in New York on Tuesday to $4.99, giving the company a market value of about $1 billion. The company had net debt of 550 million euros ($600 million) as of the end of March.

Headquartered in Signy, Switzerland, Global Blue provides technology that reimburses retailers for making shopping tax-free for consumers. It serves more than 400,000 merchant stores in over 50 countries.

Silver Lake owns more than two-thirds of Global Blue after acquiring it in a 1-billion-euro deal in 2012 and then merging it with a blank-check acquisition company sponsored by Daniel Loeb's hedge fund Third Point LLC in 2020 at a $2.6 billion valuation.

Global Blue reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 78 million euros in the 12 months to the end of March, compared to a 9.9 million euro loss in the previous 12 months, as it benefited from the travel industry's recovery. It has said it expects the bounce-back to continue as China reopens its travel.

Aug 16 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said on Wednesday it would expand its flight schedule to China later this year, as the carrier looks to capitalize on strong travel demand in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Biden administration had said last week U.S. and China would approve twice the number of passenger flights currently permitted for air carriers to fly between the two countries.

The carrier said it would offer 10 weekly flights to Shanghai-Pudong International Airport from its Seattle (SEA) and Detroit (DTW) hubs.

""Beginning October 29, the airline will operate daily flights from SEA and three-times-weekly service from DTW,"" Delta said in a statement.

Delta added that customers flying with the carrier would be able to connect to other cities within China via its partnership with China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS).

China fast encroaching on Germany's share of EU markets - study,"BERLIN, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Chinese manufacturers are increasingly giving German manufacturers a run for their money in their home European Union market, especially in the field of advanced industrial goods where Germany is a leader.

A study by the employers' economic think tank IW found that in some sectors China's share of EU imports had risen as much as or more in the two years to 2022 as they had in the preceding decade, prompting the think tank to warn that there was a risk of Germany's economic motor stalling.

After years of growth, Germany's economy entered recession in May as its champion exporters were battered by supply chain woes, inflation and rising energy costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting much soul-searching on the industrial future of Europe's economic powerhouse.

""These findings give cause to worry given the challenges of the energy change and problems with Germany's competitiveness,"" said researcher Juergen Matthes.

Among the challenges the study listed was the role played by Chinese state subsidies in many sectors where Chinese companies were taking an increasing EU market share, and while high energy costs following the loss of Russian gas were weakening energy-intensive sectors like chemicals.

High energy costs were also a drag on automotive exports at a time when Chinese e-vehicle makers were starting to conquer the European market, Matthes added.

Federal Reserve to release meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon

LONDON/WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street opened in mixed territory Wednesday while the dollar slid slightly, as investors weighed concerns over China's economy while awaiting Federal Reserve meeting minutes later in the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was up 0.31% in earlier trading, and the S&P 500 (.SPX) was basically flat, up just 0.03%. The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dipped 0.3%.

The tepid open came after declines in European and Asian stock markets. The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 45 nations, was down 0.27%.

""Much of the decline is explained by continuing concerns surrounding the economic slowdown in China, as well as rising tensions with the U.S.,"" said Thomas Gehlen, senior market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros.

China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, data showed on Wednesday.

The Chinese central bank lowered its policy rate on Tuesday, after a long run of weak figures, but investors have so far been unimpressed by the response.

News that a leading Chinese trust firm has missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month added to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact.

In currency markets, sterling picked up after data showed that Britain's inflation fell in July but the core measure came in slightly higher than expected. It was last up 0.39% at $1.275.

The dollar index , which measures the currency against six major peers, was down 0.1% at 103.14, ending a run of four straight daily increases.

Investors have bought the safe-haven dollar on the back of strong U.S. economic data and rising concerns about China.

Markets will get a sense of the Fed's thinking on interest rates at 1800 GMT (2 p.m. ET), when the minutes from July's decision are released. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points to a 5.25% to 5.5% range at the meeting.

According to pricing in derivatives markets, traders think the Fed has probably finished raising rates.

""While the Fed prefers to retain optionality given lingering uncertainties about the macro outlook, we continue to believe that July's was the last rate hike of the tightening cycle. In effect, we expect the minutes to reflect policy discussions among Fed officials are already entertaining the possibility of pausing going forward,"" said TD Securities analysts in a note.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 4.199% on Wednesday, after hitting a more than nine-month high of 4.274% in the previous session.

U.S. crude oil and Brent crude both rebounded slightly after a Tuesday selloff, climbing 0.16% and 0.1%, respectively.

Ukraine's frontline farmers face Russian rockets and rock-bottom prices,"VELYKOMYKHAILIVKA, Ukraine, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Less than 30 km (19 miles) from Ukraine's southeastern front line, rural farmers whose businesses have survived Russian rockets now fear another hammer blow to their livelihoods: rock-bottom prices for their harvest.

Mykola, a 63-year-old farmer in Dnipropetrovsk region, told Reuters on Tuesday he had to keep his crops in a missile-damaged storage site because he could not afford to spend money fixing it in case it was wrecked again by another rocket.

And yet, he is not rushing to sell.

""The price (for crops) is not acceptable for the farmers. We will store them and see what is going to happen. To restore the storage one has to have funds. With the current price for our grain it is not realistic to restore it.""

[1/5]Local farmer Mykola, 63, touches wheat grains inside a storage of his farm that was damaged last year by Russian military strike, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, near a frontline in the village of Velykomykhailivka in Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine August 15, 2023. REUTERS/Viacheslav Ratynskyi Acquire Licensing Rights

The price which Ukrainian farmers receive from traders for their produce plunged to painful lows in July, when Moscow abandoned a UN-brokered deal that allowed agricultural exports from Ukraine to be safely shipped via the Black Sea.

With that route now closed, farmers all over Ukraine, one of the world's largest growers of wheat and sunflowers, face a losing battle to get their produce out through land and river, routes that can only take a fraction of normal export volumes.

The farmers of Velykomykhailivka must juggle their worries about collapsing prices and export difficulties with the prospect of more Russian missiles crashing into their farms.

""It took more than 20 years to build this. It was destroyed in one day,"" 60-year-old Valeriy Krut said mournfully of his business, where a missile attack last year destroyed 200 tons of grain and 14 vehicles.

""This is the question: throw it all away or to maybe try to hold on? We won't have any profit this year with such storages and crop prices.""

China fast encroaching on Germany's share of EU markets - study,"BERLIN, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Chinese manufacturers are increasingly giving German manufacturers a run for their money in their home European Union market, especially in the field of advanced industrial goods where Germany is a leader.

A study by the employers' economic think tank IW found that in some sectors China's share of EU imports had risen as much as or more in the two years to 2022 as they had in the preceding decade, prompting the think tank to warn that there was a risk of Germany's economic motor stalling.

After years of growth, Germany's economy entered recession in May as its champion exporters were battered by supply chain woes, inflation and rising energy costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting much soul-searching on the industrial future of Europe's economic powerhouse.

""These findings give cause to worry given the challenges of the energy change and problems with Germany's competitiveness,"" said researcher Juergen Matthes.

Among the challenges the study listed was the role played by Chinese state subsidies in many sectors where Chinese companies were taking an increasing EU market share, and while high energy costs following the loss of Russian gas were weakening energy-intensive sectors like chemicals.

High energy costs were also a drag on automotive exports at a time when Chinese e-vehicle makers were starting to conquer the European market, Matthes added.

Federal Reserve to release meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon

LONDON/WASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Wall Street opened in mixed territory Wednesday while the dollar slid slightly, as investors weighed concerns over China's economy while awaiting Federal Reserve meeting minutes later in the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) was up 0.31% in earlier trading, and the S&P 500 (.SPX) was basically flat, up just 0.03%. The Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dipped 0.3%.

The tepid open came after declines in European and Asian stock markets. The MSCI world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 45 nations, was down 0.27%.

""Much of the decline is explained by continuing concerns surrounding the economic slowdown in China, as well as rising tensions with the U.S.,"" said Thomas Gehlen, senior market strategist at Kleinwort Hambros.

China's new home prices fell for the first time this year in July, data showed on Wednesday.

The Chinese central bank lowered its policy rate on Tuesday, after a long run of weak figures, but investors have so far been unimpressed by the response.

News that a leading Chinese trust firm has missed repayments on dozens of investment products since late last month added to fears the country's property crisis would have a wider impact.

In currency markets, sterling picked up after data showed that Britain's inflation fell in July but the core measure came in slightly higher than expected. It was last up 0.39% at $1.275.

The dollar index , which measures the currency against six major peers, was down 0.1% at 103.14, ending a run of four straight daily increases.

Investors have bought the safe-haven dollar on the back of strong U.S. economic data and rising concerns about China.

Markets will get a sense of the Fed's thinking on interest rates at 1800 GMT (2 p.m. ET), when the minutes from July's decision are released. The Fed raised rates by 25 basis points to a 5.25% to 5.5% range at the meeting.

According to pricing in derivatives markets, traders think the Fed has probably finished raising rates.

""While the Fed prefers to retain optionality given lingering uncertainties about the macro outlook, we continue to believe that July's was the last rate hike of the tightening cycle. In effect, we expect the minutes to reflect policy discussions among Fed officials are already entertaining the possibility of pausing going forward,"" said TD Securities analysts in a note.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 4.199% on Wednesday, after hitting a more than nine-month high of 4.274% in the previous session.

U.S. crude oil and Brent crude both rebounded slightly after a Tuesday selloff, climbing 0.16% and 0.1%, respectively.

MUMBAI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - India's largest tractor maker, Mahindra and Mahindra (MAHM.NS), launched a new platform to manufacture lightweight tractors on Tuesday, which would enable the company to double its exports within three years, a senior company official told Reuters.

The new platform, named Oja, was developed in collaboration with India's Mahindra Research Valley and Japan's Mitsubishi Mahindra Agriculture Machinery with an investment of 12 billion rupees ($144 million), Hemant Sikka, president of farm equipment sector at Mahindra said.

""Our aim is that with the launch of Oja, we will double our export in the next three years. So we want to increase exports from 18,000 to 36,000 in about three years,"" he said.

Exports constituted 4.4% of Mahindra's total sales in the financial year ended March 31, 2023.

On Tuesday, Mahindra launched three new tractors in Cape Town, South Africa. The company is planning to introduce tractors from the new Oja platform in various locations including North America, ASEAN countries, Brazil, Australia, Europe, and the SAARC region.

BENGALURU, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Indian software services exporter Infosys (INFY.NS) and Liberty Global (LBTYA.O) have signed a 1.5 billion euro ($1.64 billion) agreement to evolve and scale the communications firm's digital entertainment and connectivity platforms, the companies said.

The 5-year agreement, which has an option to be extended to 8 years and beyond, will have Infosys taking over the operations of the UK-headquartered company's entertainment and connectivity platforms, with its AI offering Infosys Topaz, the companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

""This will potentially enable millions of new customers, around the world, to experience next-generation digital entertainment and connectivity services through Horizon for the first time.""

Infosys will provide services worth 2.3 billion euros if the contract is extended to 8 years, and the collaboration will allow Liberty Global to realize run-rate savings in excess of 100 million euros per annum, according to the details outlined in the statement.

The order comes at a time when curtailed client spending amid macroeconomic uncertainties and recession fears have prompted Indian IT service firms to project muted growth, including Infosys, which in July, halved its full-year revenue forecast.

Last month, Infosys signed a five year AI deal with $2 billion target spend with a client whose name it did not disclose.

The Bengaluru-based IT services major has been in partnership with Liberty Global's technology services platform since February 2020.

Ukraine's frontline farmers face Russian rockets and rock-bottom prices,"VELYKOMYKHAILIVKA, Ukraine, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Less than 30 km (19 miles) from Ukraine's southeastern front line, rural farmers whose businesses have survived Russian rockets now fear another hammer blow to their livelihoods: rock-bottom prices for their harvest.

Mykola, a 63-year-old farmer in Dnipropetrovsk region, told Reuters on Tuesday he had to keep his crops in a missile-damaged storage site because he could not afford to spend money fixing it in case it was wrecked again by another rocket.

And yet, he is not rushing to sell.

""The price (for crops) is not acceptable for the farmers. We will store them and see what is going to happen. To restore the storage one has to have funds. With the current price for our grain it is not realistic to restore it.""

The price which Ukrainian farmers receive from traders for their produce plunged to painful lows in July, when Moscow abandoned a UN-brokered deal that allowed agricultural exports from Ukraine to be safely shipped via the Black Sea.

With that route now closed, farmers all over Ukraine, one of the world's largest growers of wheat and sunflowers, face a losing battle to get their produce out through land and river, routes that can only take a fraction of normal export volumes.

The farmers of Velykomykhailivka must juggle their worries about collapsing prices and export difficulties with the prospect of more Russian missiles crashing into their farms.

""It took more than 20 years to build this. It was destroyed in one day,"" 60-year-old Valeriy Krut said mournfully of his business, where a missile attack last year destroyed 200 tons of grain and 14 vehicles.

""This is the question: throw it all away or to maybe try to hold on? We won't have any profit this year with such storages and crop prices.""

MUMBAI, Aug 15 (Reuters) - India's largest tractor maker, Mahindra and Mahindra (MAHM.NS), launched a new platform to manufacture lightweight tractors on Tuesday, which would enable the company to double its exports within three years, a senior company official told Reuters.

The new platform, named Oja, was developed in collaboration with India's Mahindra Research Valley and Japan's Mitsubishi Mahindra Agriculture Machinery with an investment of 12 billion rupees ($144 million), Hemant Sikka, president of farm equipment sector at Mahindra said.

""Our aim is that with the launch of Oja, we will double our export in the next three years. So we want to increase exports from 18,000 to 36,000 in about three years,"" he said.

Exports constituted 4.4% of Mahindra's total sales in the financial year ended March 31, 2023.

On Tuesday, Mahindra launched three new tractors in Cape Town, South Africa. The company is planning to introduce tractors from the new Oja platform in various locations including North America, ASEAN countries, Brazil, Australia, Europe, and the SAARC region.

BENGALURU, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Indian software services exporter Infosys (INFY.NS) and Liberty Global (LBTYA.O) have signed a 1.5 billion euro ($1.64 billion) agreement to evolve and scale the communications firm's digital entertainment and connectivity platforms, the companies said.

The 5-year agreement, which has an option to be extended to 8 years and beyond, will have Infosys taking over the operations of the UK-headquartered company's entertainment and connectivity platforms, with its AI offering Infosys Topaz, the companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

""This will potentially enable millions of new customers, around the world, to experience next-generation digital entertainment and connectivity services through Horizon for the first time.""

Infosys will provide services worth 2.3 billion euros if the contract is extended to 8 years, and the collaboration will allow Liberty Global to realize run-rate savings in excess of 100 million euros per annum, according to the details outlined in the statement.

The order comes at a time when curtailed client spending amid macroeconomic uncertainties and recession fears have prompted Indian IT service firms to project muted growth, including Infosys, which in July, halved its full-year revenue forecast.

Last month, Infosys signed a five year AI deal with $2 billion target spend with a client whose name it did not disclose.

The Bengaluru-based IT services major has been in partnership with Liberty Global's technology services platform since February 2020.

Ukraine's frontline farmers face Russian rockets and rock-bottom prices,"VELYKOMYKHAILIVKA, Ukraine, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Less than 30 km (19 miles) from Ukraine's southeastern front line, rural farmers whose businesses have survived Russian rockets now fear another hammer blow to their livelihoods: rock-bottom prices for their harvest.

Mykola, a 63-year-old farmer in Dnipropetrovsk region, told Reuters on Tuesday he had to keep his crops in a missile-damaged storage site because he could not afford to spend money fixing it in case it was wrecked again by another rocket.

And yet, he is not rushing to sell.

""The price (for crops) is not acceptable for the farmers. We will store them and see what is going to happen. To restore the storage one has to have funds. With the current price for our grain it is not realistic to restore it.""

The price which Ukrainian farmers receive from traders for their produce plunged to painful lows in July, when Moscow abandoned a UN-brokered deal that allowed agricultural exports from Ukraine to be safely shipped via the Black Sea.

With that route now closed, farmers all over Ukraine, one of the world's largest growers of wheat and sunflowers, face a losing battle to get their produce out through land and river, routes that can only take a fraction of normal export volumes.

The farmers of Velykomykhailivka must juggle their worries about collapsing prices and export difficulties with the prospect of more Russian missiles crashing into their farms.

""It took more than 20 years to build this. It was destroyed in one day,"" 60-year-old Valeriy Krut said mournfully of his business, where a missile attack last year destroyed 200 tons of grain and 14 vehicles.

""This is the question: throw it all away or to maybe try to hold on? We won't have any profit this year with such storages and crop prices.""
