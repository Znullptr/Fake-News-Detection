Voice referendum: Australia to hold historic Indigenous vote in October,"Australians will vote in a historic referendum on 14 October to decide whether to enact an Indigenous Voice to Parliament.
If approved, the vote would recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the country's constitution, and establish a permanent body for them to give advice on laws.
The proposal is the subject of fierce debate in Australia.
The country has not had a successful referendum in almost 50 years.
For it to succeed, a majority of Australians need to vote yes. There also needs to be majority support in at least four of Australia's six states.
The composition, functions and powers of the body - whose advice would not be binding - would then be designed and debated by the parliament.
Announcing the poll date at a rally in Adelaide, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the vote ""a once-in-a-generation chance to bring our country together and to change it for the better"".
""The Voice will be... a committee of Indigenous Australians, chosen by Indigenous Australians, giving advice to government so that we can get a better result for Indigenous Australians,"" he said.
""You're being asked to vote for an idea, to say yes to an idea whose time has come - to say yes to an invitation that comes directly from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves.""
Australia is the only Commonwealth country that has never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people, and advocates say the Voice is an important step towards reconciliation.
It was recommended by a historic document in 2017 called the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Drafted by more than 250 Indigenous leaders, the statement is considered the best - though not unanimous - call to action for reforms which affect First Nations Australians.

Ukraine war: 'Drone attack' hits airport in northwest Russia city of Pskov,"Reports from Russia say there has been a drone attack on the airport of the north-western city of Pskov. 
The local governor said the military was repelling an attack. He uploaded video showing a large fire while an explosion could also be heard.
An unconfirmed Russian media report says four Ilyushin 76 transport planes were damaged at the airport.
Pskov is more than 600km (372 miles) away from Ukraine, close to the border with Estonia. 
Ukraine has not said it was involved in the incident but it rarely comments on attacks inside Russia. 
In recent weeks the country is believed to have increased its use of explosive drones to attack targets inside Russia.
In other developments:
""The defence ministry is repelling a drone attack on Pskov's airport,"" Pskov regional governor Mikhail Vedernikov said on Telegram. 
Mr Vedernikov, who said he was at the scene of the attack, added: ""According to preliminary information, there are no victims.""
Tass, quoting emergency services, reported the damage to the aircraft.
""As a result of the drone attack, four Il-76 aircraft were damaged,"" it said. ""A fire broke out and two planes burst into flames.""
There were no immediate reports on other Russian state news agencies of planes being damaged.
A drone attack on Russia's Belgorod region killed three people last week, hours after another drone hit central Moscow, Russian officials said. 
It came just days after a flagship Russian long-range bomber was destroyed in a Ukrainian drone strike near the city of St Petersburg.
Pskov region was previously targeted by drones in late May.
Although Ukraine has not said it carried out specific drone strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"" as the war with Russia continues.

James Cleverly visits Beijing as MPs criticise China strategy,"Foreign Secretary James Cleverly is visiting Beijing amid criticism from some MPs over the government's approach to China.
Mr Cleverly, the first senior UK minister to travel to China since 2018, said the country's global significance meant it could not be ignored.
But MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee said the government's strategy on China was incoherent. 
And senior Conservative Sir Iain Duncan Smith compared it to ""appeasement"".
During his visit Mr Cleverly will hold talks with China's foreign affairs minister Wang Yi and vice-president Han Zheng.
He has promised to raise concerns over human rights issues, including in Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as the treatment of Hong Kong and sanctions placed on UK MPs. 
The war in Ukraine and cyber security are also on the agenda. 
Ahead of the visit, Mr Cleverly said: ""No significant global problem - from climate change to pandemic prevention, from economic instability to nuclear proliferation - can be solved without China.
""China's size, history and global significance means they cannot be ignored, but that comes with a responsibility on the global stage.
""That responsibility means China fulfilling its international commitments and obligations.""
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said ""international and regional issues of common concern"" would be discussed. 
He added: ""We hope the British side will work with us to uphold the spirit of mutual respect, deepen exchanges, enhance mutual understanding and promote the stable development of Sino-British relations."" 
The visit comes as the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee criticises the government's approach to China in a new report on UK policy in the Indo-Pacific. 
The report describes the activities of the Chinese Communist Party as ""a threat to the UK and its interests"". 
It raises concerns about a lack of coherence in the government's approach and calls for an unclassified version of its China strategy to be published to provide guidance to the public and private sectors. 
The committee also argues that all relevant ministers should be briefed on the higher classification version of the strategy. 
The cross-party group of MPs also condemn attacks on Hong Kong dissidents in the UK as ""a sustained attempt"" by China to intimidate its critics and calls on the UK to tell the Chinese government that such a policy is unacceptable. 
The committee's Conservative chairwoman, Alicia Kearns, said it had argued for ""the need to balance economic cooperation with caution in the UK's dealings with China"". 
""The confidential, elusive China strategy is buried deep in Whitehall, kept hidden even from senior ministers across government,"" she said.
""How can those implementing policy - and making laws - do so without an understanding of the overall strategy?""
Asked on Tuesday if Mr Cleverly should be visiting Beijing, she told the BBC: ""It is more important that we are in the room with them in stark disagreement, rather than cutting off relations.""
However, former Conservative party leader and minister Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who is one of five MPs sanctioned by China, said the visit was the latest stage of ""Project Kowtow"". 
He told the PA news agency the UK position ""smells terribly of appeasement"". 
""It's like we want more business, therefore we don't want to upset the Chinese too much,"" he said. 
""What we end up with is that they think we are just too weak.""
Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy accused the Conservative government of more than a decade of ""division, inconsistency and complacency towards China"". 
He said the government needed to secure ""tangible diplomatic wins"" including an end to Chinese sanctions on British Parliamentarians. 
Relations between the UK and China have been strained in recent years over issues including a crackdown on human rights in Hong Kong.
Last year Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the so-called ""golden era"" of closer ties with China was over but he also stressed the UK could not simply ignore the country's significance. 
Mr Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss was reportedly planning to re-categorise China as a ""threat"" to the UK as part of a foreign policy review.
However, the prime minister has resisted calls from some Tories to go that far.

Nagorno-Karabakh: 'People are fainting queuing up for bread',"They call it the Road of Life, as it is the only route connecting 120,000 ethnic Armenians living in Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region with the Republic of Armenia. 
But for nearly nine months the Lachin Corridor has been blocked by Azerbaijani authorities, resulting in severe shortages of food, medication, hygiene products and fuel in the breakaway region.
Eighteen-year old Hayk is standing on the balcony of a modest hotel in Goris on the Armenian side of the border with Azerbaijan, speaking to his mother on a video call. 
""No eggs, no sugar, there are no sweets at all, bread is being rationed, got up at 04:00 the other day to stand in the queue,"" says his mother, speaking from the Karabakh town of Martakert.
Hayk is not his real name. I have changed it for his own safety.
Armenians are unable to reach their families on the other side of the Lachin Corridor because it has been blocked by Azerbaijan since December.
No independent media have been able to reach the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Photos and videos of empty shops have been circulating on social media.
""People are standing in queues for hours to get minimal food rations. People are fainting in the bread queues,"" local journalist Irina Hayrapetyan says in a recorded voice message from inside the ethnic Armenian enclave.
""We have no fuel for transport and people have to walk many kilometres by foot to stand in queues to buy whatever they can to feed their families.""
Local authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh say one in three deaths is due to malnutrition.
""I know a case when a pregnant woman lost her child because there was no petrol to get her to hospital,"" says Hayk's mother.
She speaks of no gas since March, no fuel, no medication - not even shampoo - and regular power cuts. With winter coming it will get worse.
Her son feels hatred, fear and despair: ""Because I understand sooner or later my home, my city, my country will be taken by Azerbaijan.""
For Karabakh Armenians their home is Artsakh, a self-declared republic that does not exist on the world map, as this mountainous enclave is part of Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Despite having so much in common culturally, the two South Caucasus states of Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought for control of this land for decades in wars that have cost tens of thousands of lives.
In the most recent six-week war in 2020, Azerbaijan recaptured all the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh held by Armenia since 1994.
A ceasefire brokered by Russia relied on the deployment of Russian peacekeepers to guarantee the safety of ethnic Armenians and to control the Lachin Corridor, allowing for the free movement of people and goods between Karabakh and the Republic of Armenia.
But with Russia's focus on the war in Ukraine, Azerbaijan blocked the road to Nagorno-Karabakh's regional capital Stepanakert (known in Azerbaijan as Khandendi) with government-backed environmental activists last December.
In April, Azerbaijan installed its own military checkpoint at the entrance to the Lachin Corridor justifying its ""sovereign right"" and ""full restoration of its territorial integrity"". It accused Armenia of using the road to bring in military supplies, which Armenia denies.
The only international humanitarian organisation with access to Nagorno-Karabakh is the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). 
Although it has carried out medical evacuations it has not been able to guarantee safe passage, as the Khachatryan family found out on 29 July.
That was the day 68-year-old Vagif Khachatryan was being transported to Armenia's capital Yerevan for urgent surgery for a heart condition.
""When they approached the Azerbaijani checkpoint, they said they needed to take him for 10 minutes to ask him a few questions,"" says his daughter Vera Khachatryan. ""My father was taken away with a Red Cross employee; a few minutes later the Red Cross employee returned but my father was taken in an unknown direction.""
Originally from Karabakh, she moved to the Armenian town of Jermuk after her village was returned to Azerbaijan as part of the ceasefire agreement.
""Now every minute, every second I am thinking: What if his heart stops?""
Azerbaijan's authorities have accused her father of war crimes committed during the First Karabakh war in 1992.
""There are a lot of eyewitnesses who recognise him through media reports. We never said war criminals shouldn't face justice,"" says Hikmet Hajiyev, special adviser to Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev.
Vera says the accusations are untrue. ""Defending your country is not a crime. There cannot be a fair trial in Azerbaijan. Maybe there will be justice one day, but we don't have the time to wait for it.""
Vagif Khachatryan's case has sent a shock wave among men in Nagorno-Karabakh. Three young Karabakh Armenian football players were detained this week at the same checkpoint for desecrating the Azerbaijani flag in 2021. 
The fear now is that any ethnic Armenian male could face the same fate if they try to cross.
Vera's two other sisters remain in Karabakh under blockade.
""My sister's granddaughter is two months old, there is no baby formula, her mother does not have enough milk as she is not eating properly. There is no medicine for my 22-year-old nephew who was brain-damaged during the war, he lost his ability to speak and his right arm does not move.""
This month the US called on Azerbaijan to restore free movement along the Lachin Corridor during an emergency UN Security Council meeting on the crisis.
The International Court of Justice had already told Azerbaijan it had a legally binding order to allow ""unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo"" on the road in both directions.
But Armenians are sceptical of the international community's commitment to resolve the crisis. Protesters in Yerevan have blocked the entrance to the UN office with food and sacks of flour to demand the road's reopening.
Azerbaijan denies a humanitarian crisis is unfolding. It says it wants full control of the territory, and has offered an alternative supply route via the town of Agdam, retaken during the 2020 war.
""Then afterwards the Lachin road will be opened in 24 hours as well. More roads are better for everybody,"" says the Azerbaijani president's special adviser.
Hikmet Hajiyev says Karabakh Armenians have been offered the same ""linguistic, cultural, religious, including municipal rights"" as Azerbaijani citizens.
But Armenia's ambassador at large, Edmon Marukyan, accuses Azerbaijan of making false promises when there is only one route connecting Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh. ""They want to try and change the focus of the international community, to dissolve the understanding and obligation of the Lachin Corridor."" 
Former UN special rapporteur Gulnara Shahinian warns that severing the last link with the Republic of Armenia will spell annihilation for Karabakh Armenians. ""You know what level of human rights violations occur in Azerbaijan. With their entire hatred policy, how could you expect that there would be a good attitude towards Armenians in Karabakh?""
A short drive from Goris, a mountain panorama offers a clear view of the current crisis.
On the Armenian side, nothing moves along a new road built to circumvent territory returned to Azerbaijan as part of the 2020 ceasefire agreement.
A line of lorries loaded with 400 tonnes of humanitarian aid for Karabakh, including food, medicine, baby formula and other essentials is parked along the approach to the Azerbaijani checkpoint.
Remembering the one thing Hayk's mother misses most is cooking oil, I ask a lorry driver waiting in Goris what he is transporting.  
""Twenty two tonnes of cooking oil.""

Hurricane Idalia: What is a storm surge and why is it deadly?,"This video can not be played
Watch: How quickly water rises in a storm surge
As Hurricane Idalia barrels towards Florida, residents are being warned about the potential storm surge it could cause. 
The ""life-threatening"" coastal flood could bring ocean water up 10 to 15 feet (3-5m) above ground level, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.
More than 1.5 million people across 28 counties have been asked  to evacuate because of the potential catastrophic impacts from the surge. 
In general, storm surges account for about half of deaths associated with tropical storms in the US, according to the NWS. 
A storm surge is a change in sea level caused by a storm. Large waves can be generated by the strong winds, pushing high levels of water inland.
It could lead to extensive flooding, with waves so strong they can erode beaches and highways and take out buildings. It could also cause lakes and rivers inland to flood. 
""The water has a lot of mass, and when it moves it generates a lot of force on structures,"" said Steven Morey, a professor at the Florida A&M School of the Environment. 
""You get a lot of forces pushing on structures and they are just not built to withstand it, they could knock them down or knock people down,"" Prof Morey told the BBC. 
Mostly all of Florida's western coast will see a rising tide in the next 36 hours, the NWS said on Monday, though some areas will be harder hit than others.
The tide will be highest between the Ochlockonee River, southwest of Tallahassee, and the Chassahowitzka River, about 66 miles (106 km) north of Tampa. 
Prof Morey said he is particularly concerned about some of those areas, which have small communities that have not seen a major hurricane since 1935. 
This includes the town of Steinhatchee, home to around 500 people, and the city of Cedar Key, home to nearly 700 people. 
""None of the structures (in those towns) have gone through what they are going to go through,"" Prof Morey said. 
He added it is important that people heed the evacuation orders and leave, and that there are not structures safe enough to withstand the waves in those areas.
Parts of Tampa itself - the third most populous city in Florida at nearly 400,000 residents - are also under storm surge warnings, but with slightly milder impacts as water is projected to rise up to 7ft in the region. 
Still, water that high could pose a threat to Tampa's low-lying areas. But Prof Morey said Tampa is more familiar with storm surges and its structures are more well-built than other areas at risk. 
Hurricane Idalia coincides with a super moon - meaning a full moon that is in close proximity to earth. 
Full moons and new moons are known to have an impact on tide levels due to the gravitational pull that occurs when the sun, moon and earth are in alignment. 
This causes extra-high high tides, and very low low-tides - both commonly known as spring tides. 
Prof Morey said there is no doubt that the super moon's influence will be felt on the predicted storm surge in Florida.
""This area where the storm is projected to hit has the largest tidal range in the entire Gulf of Mexico,"" he said, adding the difference between high tide and low tide is 3ft to 4ft. 
""When you're talking about a 12-foot storm surge, the difference can be significant.""

On patrol with Tunisia's coast guard: Nine boats in 24 hours,"Tethered to a small speedboat and being towed towards us was the first of nine migrant boats we would encounter during our 24-hour patrol with the Tunisian coast guard. 
More than 180 people were rescued, all wearing rubber rings, but no life jackets, as they were rescued from what is now the world's busiest migrant route into Europe. 
Within half an hour of our departure from the Tunisian coastal city of Sfax and boarding the national coast guard patrol boat, the radar had intercepted its first signal. 
Working in tandem with two speed boats, these smaller, more agile vessels were deployed first to find the migrant ship. 
Once located, their captain was ordered to turn off the engine and submit to being towed back to the larger patrol vessel where six Tunisian coastguards stood ready to assist.  
Sfax, which is less than 200km (124 miles) across the Mediterranean from the Italian island of Lampedusa, has long been a transit hub for sub-Saharan Africans wishing to travel illegally into Europe - as well as a network of smugglers seeking to profit from them. 
Many migrants used to go by road to Libya, and from there catch a boat to Greece. 
But last year, after the Libyan authorities deported thousands of migrants and intensified patrols along the coast, the preferred route for migrants wishing to travel to Europe switched to Tunisia. 
In July, the European Commission offered to contribute $115m (£90m) towards Tunisian efforts to intensify its border controls, search-and-rescue operations and anti-smuggling initiatives. 
The $115m is part of a larger aid package being offered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Tunisia has not yet agreed to the terms of how exactly the money should be spent. 
The UN reported that in the first six months of this year, 54,049 people were picked up by the Italian or Tunisian coast guard - a figure close to double the number who attempted the crossing during the whole of 2022.
It has also been an exceptionally perilous start to the year with the loss of more than 2,000 lives, according to the UN. 
The coast guards were met with a wave of anger as the 46 passengers began to disembark from the migrant boat that had been towed.
""Let me go to Italy,"" one man shouted. ""I'll only try again,"" screamed another. 
All hailing from Ivory Coast and Guinea, they told us it was their third and even fourth attempt to cross this stretch of sea.
Although we were allowed to witness everything that went on during the operation, the crew on board had been told not to answer any of our questions. Instead, their spokesman Hossam El-Din El-Jababli, spoke to us once we were back at the port.
""There are those who threaten to throw themselves back overboard. To even pour petrol over themselves and set it alight,"" said Mr El-Jababli. 
After releasing all the passengers back onto Tunisian soil, the radar soon detects another boat. 
The two speed boats are sent to investigate. 
As the second makeshift metal boat of the day pulled alongside us, all 20 people on board began begging for food and water. They tell us they have been adrift for more than 12 hours. 
The passengers, from Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Syria, describe fleeing from war zones before ending up in Tunisia. Unlike the first boat, this group appears deeply traumatised and exhausted. 
Returning to the shore, their captain is arrested by the Tunisian authorities. Charged with human trafficking, he could face a long prison sentence if found guilty. 
As for the rest of the passengers, after having their details checked by the authorities, they are free to go - no doubt to try again. 
Smugglers' prices for a place on the boat hugely vary depending on the migrant's nationality, the quality of the vessel and the time of year. 
During these past summer months, prices reported in Sfax have ranged from 1,200 Tunisian dinars ($385; £300) to 6,500 Tunisian dinars ($2,100; £1,640). Those only able to pay the lower price are offered the most unstable vessels.
But with every coast guard interception and failed attempt, many migrants fall into a spiral of debt. They pledge to try one more time, to take one more loan. Only to fail again and sink deeper into poverty. 
Sailing back out into the channel, a dozen items of clothes and shoes were seen floating in the water. Even the crew fell silent as we passed by.  
Speaking to the BBC, the city's health director, Hatem Al-Sharif, said more than 700 unidentified people, including young children, have been buried in unmarked graves on the outskirts of Sfax since the beginning of this year. 
Some blame Tunisian smugglers who, along this section of the coast, are known for using worn-out, unsuitable metal boats.
We saw dozens of these vessels, stacked high in a huge heap after being seized during a raid by the Tunisian authorities. 
The local fishermen too said they were particularly wary of these boats as they are more prone to sinking and often splice their nets. They also describe with much sadness what it feels like when they discovered a body, especially when it is a child. 
""I've seen a lot of dead bodies. I don't want the migrants to continue making this journey. Our coastline has become a cemetery,"" say Al-Jilani Kamel, a fisherman. 
Over the course of the next hour, we watched as the crew worked tirelessly, intercepting five more migrant boats in succession.
Then just as their shift was coming to a close, there was a final call. This time, it concerned a boat full of their own compatriots. 
Tunisians make up fewer than 15% of those trying to cross from the country into Europe. But as we saw, their anguish was no less intense. 
As we pulled alongside their vessel, one Tunisian man stood up and began threatening to throw his young daughter overboard - for which he was later arrested. 
Another screamed this was his fourth attempt. ""It's as if I'm already dead,"" he cried out.
As we disembarked for the final time and began driving away from the port, dozens of migrants were walking along the side of the road after being released by the coast guard. 
""We will probably spend the night here in these olive groves,"" said Abubakr, from Ivory Coast. 
""And then we will try again,"" said another young man. 
Asked if they were afraid of dying while trying to cross, a Sudanese man, Adel Adbullah, said: ""I fled from war. I don't think I will see any worse at sea than I already have. I have nothing to lose.""

Hurricane Idalia: Florida hunkers down for 'unprecedented' storm,"This video can not be played
Watch: Floridians prepare for Hurricane Idalia
People in the path of Hurricane Idalia have been warned to evacuate without delay, as the storm hurtles towards the US state of Florida.
It is forecast to hit the Gulf Coast as a major Category 3 hurricane with winds up to 125mph (201km/h) on Wednesday morning.
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned Idalia would bring ""life-threatening"" weather to the state.
Coastal areas could be deluged by a storm surge of up to 10-15ft (3-5m).  
""Very few people can survive being in the path of a major storm surge, and this storm will be deadly if we don't get out of harm's way and take it seriously,"" said Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Deanne Criswell.
The storm was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on Tuesday afternoon, with maximum sustained winds of 100mph.
Idalia is projected to strike the vulnerable coastal area of Big Bend, which has not seen such a major hurricane since the 1800s, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said.
Big Bend sits roughly where north-south portion of the state's peninsula bends toward the east-west portion of the Panhandle, curving along the Apalachee Bay.
According to the NHC, no major hurricane has tracked into Apalachee Bay in north-western Florida since 1851.
""For some communities this is probably going to be worse than they're envisioning, because so few people understand the power of a major hurricane,"" Jamie Rhome, deputy director of the National Hurricane Centre, told the BBC.
Idalia's outer bands have already brought tornado warnings in several Southwest Florida communities, including Golden Gate, Naples, Hillsborough Lafayette Lake, and Marco Island. 
Twenty-eight of Florida's 67 counties were under some form of evacuation order as of Tuesday evening, including 14 mandatory orders in counties clustered along the state's upper Gulf Coast. 
Urging people in evacuation areas to move to safety, Mr DeSantis said residents that do not leave immediately will not be able to do so until the storm passes. 
""You don't need to run hundreds of miles, just get to higher ground, get to a safe structure,"" Mr DeSantis said.
Much of Florida, including the densely populated Tampa area, is braced for severe weather. Tampa International Airport closed on Tuesday, and is expected to remain shut until Thursday morning. 
Chanel Jay, who is facing her second hurricane in a year since moving to Florida from Pennsylvania, told the BBC she wasn't taking any chances. 
She was hunkering down in an East Tampa shelter set up at a school about a 10-minute drive away from her home.""Florida weather has a mind of its own,"" she said.
Mary Wolcott Martino, 79, a travel writer in St Petersburg, a city in the Tampa Bay area, told Reuters news agency she was packing up as fast as she could on Tuesday afternoon.
She grabbed items that could not be replaced, including hard drives with family photos. 
""We're leaving in five minutes, headed out the door now,"" she said. She and her husband are not bothering to board up their home, like they have in the past, telling Reuters they are more concerned about storm surges than winds. 
""We're on the canal and just nine feet above sea level,"" she said.
Up to 12in (30cm) of rain is forecast in northern Florida, where Idalia is expected to make landfall. 
At 17:00 local time on Tuesday (21:00 GMT), Idalia was 195 miles (310 km) south-west of Tampa, Florida, according to the NHC's most recent update.
More than a dozen emergency shelters have been opened by the state, with seven in the Tampa Bay area alone - just south of where Idalia is expected to make landfall. 
Along evacuation routes, tolls were being waived and some 420,000 gallons of fuel was ready to be deployed at petrol stations, Mr DeSantis said.
Florida has mobilised more than 5,500 National Guardsmen to assist with the state's emergency response, and up to 40,000 utility workers are on standby to tackle power cuts. 
Residents in the path of the storm should expect outages, Mr DeSantis said. 
""There's going to be destruction of houses and homes and structures,"" warned David DeCarlo, director of Hernando County Emergency Management. 
Last year, Hurricane Ian made landfall in south-western Florida, wreaking more than $100bn (£79bn) in damage and killing over 100 people.
On Monday Idalia swiped the western shore of Cuba, where tens of thousands evacuated ahead of flooding and high winds.
Residents battened down homes and secured fishing boats. Brown floodwaters had swamped the small fishing village of Guanimar, south of Havana, by mid-afternoon.
""We've had two days of rain already,"" Yadira Alvarez, 34, told Reuters on Monday. She said storm water had already swelled to knee-height inside her home.
The US states of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina could see heavy rainfall as well, forecasters said. 
On Tuesday, South Carolina declared a state of emergency in anticipation of Idalia. 
Far to the east of Idalia, Hurricane Franklin, the first major hurricane of the season, has brought life-threatening rip currents to the Bermuda and the US East Coast. These conditions are expected to continue in the coming days, according to the NHC. 
As of Tuesday afternoon local time, the eye of Franklin was just west of Bermuda, moving north-east with maximum sustained winds of 125mph (201 km/h). Its current path avoids any major land mass, with the storm moving to the east of North America. 
The impact of climate change on the frequency of tropical storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes. 
As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.

Harrison Floyd: Bond agreement reached for jailed Georgia defendant,"The sole defendant in the Georgia election interference case being held in Fulton County Jail is expected to be released five days after his arrest.
It comes after a judge set a bond in his case. 
Harrison Floyd's lawyer told the BBC that his client had not been able to shower during his time in jail and was ""concerned"" for his personal safety. 
The BBC has reached out to Fulton County Jail for comment.
Mr Floyd surrendered on Thursday without a lawyer, at the time choosing to forego legal help over the cost.
Georgia prosecutors allege the 39-year-old former US Marine was part of a plot to pressure an election worker into making false claims about ballot manipulation and election fraud in the state. 
He turned himself in late last week without a pre-negotiated bond. 
At a hearing on Friday, where he represented himself, his request for bond was denied by a judge, in part because of charges he faces for allegedly assaulting federal agents in Maryland earlier this year.
According to court documents in that case, FBI agents approached Mr Floyd at his Maryland home as part of a federal criminal investigation into Donald Trump and his alleged role in the Capitol riots.
The affidavit accused Mr Floyd of physically assaulting and shouting at an agent, The Washington Post reported.
Atlanta Judge Emily Richardson also considered Mr Floyd a flight risk. 
He later retained a lawyer, who helped to negotiate the $100,000 (£79,000) bond. It is unclear when he will be released. 
An online fundraiser helping to pay for his lawyer, Chris Kachouroff, has so far raised over $270,000. 
The 18 other defendants in the case - including former President Trump and his one-time lawyer Rudy Giuliani - surrendered last week with negotiated bonds in place and were processed and quickly released.
Mr Floyd's lawyer told the BBC his client was left ""rotting in Fulton County Jail"", and argued Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis should have helped secure his release. 
Jeff DiSantis, a spokesman Ms Willis, disagreed.
""Mr Floyd has had the opportunity to work out a consent bond in the same manner as the other defendants named in the indictment, but chose not to do so until today,"" Mr DiSantis told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
Fulton County Jail is known as notoriously unsafe. Six people have died there this year. Last year, one inmate died after being found unconscious in his cell, covered in bed bugs. 
Mr Floyd is one of two black defendants of the 19 charged in the Georgia indictment and is the former leader of the conservative grassroots organisation Black Voices for Trump.
His lawyer, Mr Kachouroff said: ""I just can't get over the optics of only the black guy left in there.""
Mr Floyd is not the only Georgia defendant to raise concerns over the legal costs they face related to the indictment - he told the judge during his Friday hearing he couldn't put his ""family in that kind of debt"".  
In April, Mr Giuliani visited Mr Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence to make a ""desperate"" plea to ask the former president to help pay his legal bills, according to the BBC's media partner CBS.

Hong Kong: Closure of Cantonese language group worries residents,"A group founded to promote the use of Cantonese in Hong Kong has shut down after authorities raided its founder's family home last week.
The government cited the controversial national security law and asked the foundation to take down a three-year-old short story.
The raid is seen as another erosion of freedom of expression in the city.
The group's founder told the BBC that he decided to shut down the organisation on legal advice. 
""My biggest concern is the safety of my family members and friends in Hong Kong. I found out that if I did not shut down the organisation, they could keep using the materials online, and harass the people I care about,"" said Andrew Chan, 28, who teaches Chinese and Cantonese online.
Cantonese is a Chinese dialect spoken by an overwhelming majority of people on the island, as well as the Guangdong province in China. 
Mr Chan founded the Hong Kong Language Learning Association with the mission to protect the ""language rights of the Hong Kong people"".
Flashpoints between Hong Kong and mainland China usually revolve around language, identity, and differences in political convictions. 
The fictional essay at the centre of the political storm is titled ""Our Time"" and was submitted by an independent author to a 2020 writing competition hosted by Mr Chan's organisation and funded by the Hong Kong government. 
It tells the story about a man who emigrated from Hong Kong to the UK with his parents in 2020 - the year the national security law was imposed. After the death of his parents in 2050, the man visits Hong Kong, only to find the city's history scrubbed away by authoritarian rule. 
The article ends with a phrase, ""The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting."" It was written by the late Czech novelist Milan Kundera, whose many books usually contained themes around Czechoslovak Communism. 
The officers wanted the short story on the association's website to be taken down, failing which, they said, Mr Chan could be wanted by the national security department. 
Mr Chan said he felt threatened after he contacted the Hong Kong authorities.
""In the conversation, I found that they pretty much have knowledge of where I worked and also the activities of the Hong Kong Language Learning Association,"" he said. 
Hong Kong authorities have not addressed the matter directly. The BBC has reached out to the National Security Department for comment. 
Mr Chan, whose family remains in Hong Kong, said he did not know where he could go now. ""I am now travelling in Australia. I did not plan to stay. It was just a vacation. I still haven't figured out where I can settle as I cannot get back to my hometown,"" he said.
The closure of the Hong Kong Language Learning Association has revived some debates around whether Beijing is trying to replace Cantonese with Chinese. 
""For the Hong Kong people, the rhythm and cadence of Cantonese is theirs. Losing Cantonese would mean losing a central part of their being, in some sense becoming immigrants in their own land, "" said Norman Matloff, a professor at UC Davis who speaks both Chinese and Cantonese. 
However, Mr Chan believes the reason his organisation got into trouble is because the essay in question was shortlisted in a writing competition with funding from the government. 
""Supporting Cantonese had become an excuse for them to report us under the national security law,"" he said.

Ukraine war: Hundreds bid farewell to fighter ace Juice,"Hundreds of people in Kyiv have paid their respects to one of Ukraine's most celebrated fighter pilots, who was killed in a mid-air crash last week.
Capt Andrii Pilshchykov, who flew under the call-sign ""Juice"", and two other pilots died when two L-39 training planes collided in northern Ukraine.
Pilshchykov, 30, won fame for dogfights over Kyiv during the early phase of Russia's full-scale invasion.
He served in the 40th tactical aviation brigade.
The brigade's members came to be known collectively as the ""Ghost of Kyiv"".
Last year, as Russia launched hundreds of cruise missiles and drones at Ukraine, Pilshchykov spoke to the BBC about the pressure he felt as a pilot tasked with trying to intercept deadly weapons before they struck.
""Intercepting the cruise missiles, your mission is to save the lives on the ground, to save the city. If you are not able, it's a terrible feeling that somebody will die. Somebody will die in minutes and you didn't prevent that,"" he said.

"Sara Sharif: Cause of death not yet established, says coroner","The cause of death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif has not yet been established, an inquest heard.
Sara's body was found alone at home in Woking on 10 August, a day after her relatives flew to Pakistan.
The precise cause of death was ""not yet ascertained"" but was likely to be ""unnatural"", an inquest into her death at Surrey Coroner's Court heard.
At the opening of the inquest, coroner Simon Wickens adjourned the hearing for six months while police investigate.
Detectives launched an international manhunt following the discovery of Sara's body.
The three people who are wanted by the police are Sara's father, Urfan Sharif, 41, his partner, Beinash Batool, 29, and his brother, Faisal Malik, 28.
Mr Wickens, the area coroner for the County of Surrey, said he would not normally adjourn proceedings for such a long period, but he was doing so because of the complexity of the police investigation and the international element.
He confirmed that Sara Sharif was born in Slough in January 2013 and died in her home in Woking.
Her death was verified in the early hours of 10 August, but that was not necessarily the time of death.
She was identified by comparing her DNA with that of her mother Olga Sharif.
The court heard that at a post-mortem examination the pathologist Nathaniel Carey was unable to ascertain the precise cause of death, but said it was likely to be unnatural.
The coroner offered his sincere condolences to Sara's family and suspended the inquest until 29 February.
Nobody from her family was present at the inquest opening.
Meanwhile, Pakistan police said they were widening the search for the family of Sara.
Detectives told the BBC they had expanded the search to two more areas around the city of Jhelum - taking the total to four areas, having received new information from multiple sources.
Hafiz Hashmi, the head imam of the Shah Jahan Mosque in Woking, said the whole community was upset and wanted ""justice to be served"".
He described Pakistani police and the system in Pakistan as ""questionable"" and he said bribery was very common, but he urged Mr Sharif to contact police.
Mr Hashmi said: ""Without investigation, we can't blame anyone, we can't say anything. But as a father, it is his responsibility. It is his duty, duty of care. He should come forward and speak with the Pakistani police and the UK authorities.""
Police in the UK said Mr Sharif, 41, made a 999 call from Pakistan leading to them finding Sara's body, shortly after landing in Islamabad. 
A court in Pakistan last week said Mr Sharif's relatives in the country could not be detained for questioning on his whereabouts.
It came after Mr Sharif's family said police had illegally detained two of his brothers who live in Pakistan.

Jacksonville shooting: Audio of 911 call by gunman's dad released,"Police have released audio of a 911 call by the father of a gunman who killed three people in a racially motivated attack in Florida. 
The dad is heard telling an emergency dispatcher the 21-year-old has stopped taking psychiatric medication.
The killer used a legally purchased rifle and handgun in the attack on Saturday in Jacksonville, say police.
The three victims were Anolt Laguerre Jr, 19, Jerrald De'Shaun Gallion, 29, and 52 year-old Angela Carr.
The father called 911 at 13:53 EDT (17:53 GMT) on Saturday to express concern about his son, who he said had left the house two hours beforehand, according to the audio. 
His son had texted him at 13:18 asking his father to check his bedroom, where he had left a will, racist writings and a suicide note, according to officials. 
The text was sent minutes after the white gunman, armed with a swastika-etched AR-15 rifle, had opened fire at a Dollar General store and just before he turned the gun on himself, say investigators.
The gunman, Ryan Christopher Palmeter, shot Ms Carr, an Uber driver, in the store's car park before entering the premises just after 13:00, where he shot Mr Laguerre, a store employee, and Mr Gallion, a customer, officials say. 
The father told officials his son had tried to kill himself when he was 15 and that it appeared he had stopped taking his psychiatric medication because he had a full bottle of his prescription in his room. 
The dad told officials his son, who had no criminal history, had dropped out of Flagler college and moved home two years go. 
He said his son used to work at Home Depot, but lost the job and ""pretty much has been living in his room"". 
""He doesn't go anywhere,"" the father says.
Police tell him officers are on the way to the family home in the town of Orange Park. 
Officials have said the gunman was detained for 72 hours in 2017 under the Baker Act, mental health legislation that allows for an individual's involuntary detainment.
Authorities have said the shooter left behind a journal detailing his hatred of black people. 
Before the shooting, he drove to the car park of the historically black Edwards Waters University, where students noticed him putting on a tactical vest, gloves and a mask.
A campus security officer approached the suspect and he fled, opening fire at the store about 10 minutes later.
The US Department of Justice is investigating the attack as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism.

Number two US House Republican Steve Scalise has rare cancer,"Steve Scalise, the second most powerful Republican in the US House of Representatives, has announced he is being treated for cancer.
The House Majority leader said he had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer.
""I expect to work through this period and intend to return to Washington,"" the Louisiana lawmaker said.
The 57-year-old survived a mass shooting in 2017 and underwent an extensive recovery.
Mr Scalise said in a statement on Tuesday that ""after a few days of not feeling like myself this past week, I had some blood work done"".
""The results uncovered some irregularities and after undergoing additional tests, I was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a very treatable blood cancer,"" he said.
""I am incredibly grateful we were able to detect this early and that this cancer is treatable,"" he added. 
""I am thankful for my excellent medical team, and with the help of God, support of my family, friends, colleagues, and constituents, I will tackle this with the same strength and energy as I have tackled past challenges."" 
Mr Scalise was elected to the US Congress in 2008 and has steadily risen through the ranks of Republican leadership. 
He is currently right-hand man to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and his job is to keep the chamber's conservative majority in line.
In 2017, Mr Scalise was attending practice for a congressional baseball game when a gunman opened fire on the group, wounding five people.
Mr Scalise was shot in the hip. He underwent a months-long recovery and eventually returned to work, where he continued to serve in leadership positions.
On Tuesday, Republican colleagues noted Mr Scalise's previous recovery in messages of support.
""The same faith, family support, and internal strength that made Steve such an inspiration to others after he was shot, will bring him through this illness and once more inspire us all,"" Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said in a statement.
Multiple myeloma is relatively uncommon in the US, according to the American Cancer society, with about 35,730 cases expected to be diagnosed this year.
The cancer affects plasma cells, the white blood cells that help with the body's immune response. 
""Although there currently is no cure for this disease, it is treatable if detected early enough,"" Dr E Anders Kolb, head of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, said in a statement.  
""Over the years, countless treatment advances have proven effective in reducing symptoms, slowing disease progression and prolonging life while preserving a patient's quality of life."" 
Three other members of Congress have undergone cancer treatment since 2022.
Democrats Jamie Raskin, Dan Kildee, and Joaquin Castro all disclosed their diagnoses. 
Mr Raskin announced in April that he was in remission, and Mr Kildee said he had a ""successful"" operation this past spring.

Prigozhin buried in private funeral - Wagner chief's press service,"This video can not be played
Watch: BBC gets as close as possible to Prigozhin grave
Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin has been buried in a private funeral in St Petersburg, his press service has said.
It said the ceremony, in his home city, was held in ""a closed format"", and all those ""wishing to say goodbye can visit the Porokhovskoe cemetery"".
The mercenary chief was confirmed dead by Russian officials after genetic analysis of 10 bodies found in a crashed plane on 23 August near Moscow.
The Kremlin has denied speculation it was to blame for the crash.
But a number of Russia watchers - both in the country and abroad - have described Prigozhin, 62, as a ""dead man walking"" since an aborted armed mutiny he led back in June.
All 10 people on board - including Prigozhin's right-hand man Dmitry Utkin - died in the crash in the Tver region, north-west of Moscow.
The Wagner press service gave the information about Prigozhin's funeral in a short statement on Telegram on Tuesday.
It provided no further details.
In life Yevgeny Prigozhin had been a man of mystery. Often concealing his identity, with the help of wigs and fake beards.
Clearly the mystery didn't end with his death.
All day St Petersburg had been buzzing with rumours and speculation about where the mercenary chief would be laid to rest. There was no advance warning. No official announcement of when and where it would happen. On social media at least four different cemeteries were being talked about as possibilities.
In the end, it was none of them.
Eventually Prigozhin's representatives revealed that the head of Wagner had been buried in Porokhovskoe Cemetery on the edge of St Petersburg beside his late father.
No military honours for the mercenary chief. And reportedly only a few people attended. 
Outside the cemetery we're told that it is officially closed for the day, so we can't go in. And just to make sure that the media gathered outside doesn't try to get in, the place is pretty much in lockdown. 
There are long lines of police along the perimeter fence and throughout the cemetery. I can see sniffer dogs, anti-drone officers and riot police.
The funeral may have been low-key. The security; far from it. 
You can understand why. 
The Wagner mutiny, that Prigozhin organised, was viewed as treachery by the Kremlin. As far as the Russian authorities are concerned, the less attention the better. 
Russia's MSK1 website quoted cemetery officials as saying the funeral was held at about 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Tuesday.
""That's what [Prigozhin's] relatives wished,"" the officials said.
MSK1 also said Prigozhin was buried next to his father's grave. It added that Wagner's black-yellow-red flag could be seen at the site.
St Petersburg's Fontanka news outlet reported that metal detectors had been installed at the entrance, as the authorities were believed to be preparing for a mass pilgrimage to Prigozhin's grave.
Separately, the funeral of Prigozhin's top deputy Valery Chekalov - who was also on the crashed plane - was also held on Tuesday on St Petersburg's Severnoe Cemetery. The 47-year-old is is believed to have have been running Prigozhin's non-military business interests, which Western governments say are used to finance the mercenary group.
Earlier in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the Kremlin leader would not be attending Prigozhin's funeral, although Wagner fighters played a key part in the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Mr Putin in February 2022. 
Mr Putin stayed silent for nearly 24 hours after the crash. The following day he sent his condolences to the families of all the victims.
And he described Prigozhin as a ""talented person"" who ""made serious mistakes in life"".
In June, Prigozhin - once a Putin loyalist - led the rebellion against the top two generals of the Russian armed forces.
His mercenaries took control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, and were marching on Moscow - only halting the mutiny about 200km (125 miles) from the capital.
Mr Putin at the time described the rebellion as ""treachery"" and a ""stab in the back"", but a deal was later struck for Wagner fighters either to join Russian regular army units or move to Belarus, a Russian ally.
However, there has been frenzied speculation that Russian security forces were somehow involved in the plane crash.
US officials quoted by CBS, the BBC's media partner in America, have said that the most likely cause of the crash was an explosion on board the private jet.
Mr Peskov dismissed rumours of foul play as an ""absolute lie"".

Ministers skip UN meeting on disability rights,"The UK government declined to attend a UN review of its treatment of disabled people after an inquiry warned of ""grave"" violations of their rights.
A 2016 report by a UN committee found welfare reforms had ""adversely"" affected disabled people in the UK.
The UK government was scheduled to attend a hearing at the UN in Geneva on Monday to assess progress.
But it pulled out, saying it would meet UN officials in March 2024 instead, sparking anger from campaigners.
A government spokesperson said it had followed all of the committee's required procedures and was committed to the ""advancement of rights for disabled people in this country"".
The UK published responses to the UN's Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)'s recommendations in 2018, 2021 and 2022 and was due to give a further update this year.
After the UK delegation's no-show on Monday, the CRPD held a follow-up feedback session with British disability rights groups.
A committee spokesperson advised the group to raise the postponement of the review with the UK government.
Linda Burnip, co-founder of the Disabled People Against Cuts campaign, said the government's no-show was ""very offensive"" to the UN's disability committee.
She said her group ""has no paid staff and our main core funding is from supporters' donations, so frankly if we can meet deadlines I think it's a disgrace that the government can't too"".
Kamran Mallick, CEO of Disability Rights UK, said people from disabled rights organisations ""attended the meeting in Geneva this week despite the huge challenges of inaccessible and unfriendly flights, hotels, and transport"".
""No one from the UK government was there to hear the facts, figures and stories of increasing poverty, lack of support, inaccessible services and infrastructure that limit the life chances of disabled people,"" Mr Mallick said.
Mr Mallick said the government's failure to attend ""signals the low priority they give to disabled people and the worsening inequalities we face"".
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) was among the organisations to give evidence to the committee in Geneva.
Rachel Albinson of the EHRC said there was concern that the ""grave and systemic"" violations the committee found during its inquiry persisted, and more recent changes had exacerbated many of the issues.
A few weeks ago, the human rights watchdog accused the UK government of making ""slow progress"" in improving the lives of disabled people.
In a report submitted to the UN, the EHRC said some of the recommendations made by the 2016 inquiry had not been delivered.
The EHRC report warns that many disabled people continue to face discrimination in the UK, and the situation continues to worsen, particularly in light of current cost-of-living pressures.
In a letter to Kemi Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, and Minister for Disabled People Tom Pursglove, the EHRC said it was disappointing the UK government has postponed its participation in the UN committee's review.
The Scottish Human Rights Commission, which co-signed the letter, said the delay ""risks sending the message that disabled people's rights are not a priority"".
""The UK government must take its human rights obligations seriously and fully cooperate with the international accountability processes it has signed up to,"" said Jan Savage, executive director of the Scottish Human Rights Commission.
The government said it was ""fully committed to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities"", an international human rights treaty which the UK has signed up to.
Last month, the government launched a consultation on its Disability Action Plan.
An Equality Hub spokesperson said work had been undertaken to reform the disability benefits system and investing £2bn to support sick and disabled people back into work.

Watch: BBC gets as close as possible to Prigozhin grave,"This video can not be played
Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports from the perimeter of the cemetery where it is believed Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin has been buried.
The 62-year-old's press service has said a private funeral was held at the Porokhovskoye cemetery. 
Prigozhin was confirmed dead by Russian authorities after a plane crash on 23 August near Moscow. 
The Kremlin has denied any speculation it was to blame for the crash.

US presidential election 2024: The Republicans challenging Donald Trump,"The race for the 2024 Republican White House nomination is heating up.
Several big-name and dark-horse contenders have joined an increasingly crowded field in recent weeks. 
All are seeking to unseat the current front-runner, former President Donald Trump, who continues to dominate in national opinion polls.
The eventual winner will challenge the presumptive Democratic nominee, President Joe Biden, in the general election of November next year.
Mike Pence officially launched his campaign with a speech on 7 June, putting him on a collision course with his former boss.
The speech offered his most forceful repudiation of Donald Trump to date, accusing the ex-president of being unfaithful to the US constitution and of abandoning conservative values.
It was a far cry from his role as a loyal deputy to Mr Trump as his vice-president for four years - until 2021's Capitol riot splintered their relationship.
The son of a Korean War veteran, Mr Pence began his career in conservative politics as a talk radio host.
He was elected to the House in 2000 and served until 2013, describing himself as a ""principled conservative"" and aligning with the Tea Party movement.
He also served as governor of Indiana from 2013-17. In that role, he passed the largest tax cut in state history, and signed bills to restrict abortion and protect religious freedom. 
Mr Pence, 64, is a born-again evangelical Christian and his addition to the 2016 presidential ticket is credited with helping mobilise the crucial voting bloc on behalf of Mr Trump.
Calm and soft-spoken, he was seen as an effective surrogate to the bombastic president. But Mr Trump turned on him for lacking ""courage"" after he refused to help overturn the 2020 election results.
Pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021 and were heard chanting ""Hang Mike Pence!"". At one point, they were reportedly within 40ft (12m) of the vice-president.
The former New Jersey governor announced his candidacy on 6 June at a town hall event in New Hampshire - the state that hosts the second contest in the Republican primary race.
After his own 2016 presidential bid failed, Chris Christie allied himself with Mr Trump, leading the incoming president's transition team and preparing him for debates against Mr Biden in 2020.
But he has become a vociferous critic of Mr Trump since the US Capitol riots. 
The sharp-tongued Mr Christie, 60, previewed an attack line on Mr Trump at a New Hampshire town hall in April, saying: ""Donald Trump is a TV star, nothing more, nothing less. Let me suggest to you that in putting him back in the White House, the re-runs will be worse than the original show.""
Mr Christie served two terms as New Jersey governor from 2010-18. Massively popular in his first term, his second was overshadowed by a political scandal involving bridge lane closures - part of an alleged political vendetta against a Democratic mayor.
Before being elected as governor, Mr Christie served as New Jersey's top prosecutor under President George W Bush from 2002-08, and famously sent Charles Kushner - the father of Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared - to prison. 
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has worked hard to emulate Mr Trump, and is often viewed as the candidate most capable of defeating him in a head-to-head race.
Boosted to the governorship by Mr Trump's endorsement in 2018, he romped to re-election in last year's midterms by more than 1.5 million votes, the largest margin in the state in more than four decades. Under his tenure, Republican voters outnumber Democrats in the state for the first time.
At 44 years old, the Harvard and Yale-educated lawyer is still a relative newcomer in US politics.
He once served in the US Navy, including a tour in Iraq. He was also a little-known member of the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2018.
But Mr DeSantis has seen his star rise considerably since he became governor, a role in which he has positioned himself as an enthusiastic culture warrior.
He has backed legislation to defund diversity and inclusion programmes, ban teaching on gender identity in public schools, ban drag shows and gender-affirming care for minors, restrict abortions and loosen gun laws.  He is also mired in an escalating legal battle with Walt Disney World.
The governor has touted his record as a ""blueprint"" for conservative leadership, and supporters have touted him as a drama-free alternative to re-nominating the former president.
Mr Trump has responded by attacking him almost daily on social media.
Senator Tim Scott has a decades-long career in South Carolina politics and entered the race in May with nearly $22m (£18m) - more than his rivals - in cash on hand.
The only black man to ever serve in both chambers of Congress, the 57-year-old has represented his home state in the Senate since 2013.
Mr Scott is the grandson of a cotton field worker and the son of a single mother, and he has often spoken of how his family rose ""from cotton to Congress"" in a lifetime.
He launched his 2024 bid vowing to turn around ""a nation in retreat"" and revive America's ""culture of greatness"".
Well-liked among his colleagues, he quickly earned endorsements from two fellow senators, including John Thune, the chamber's second highest-ranking Republican.
But he's not the only South Carolina Republican to throw their hat in the ring. 
Nikki Haley announced her bid for the presidency in mid-February, becoming the first major Republican candidate to commit to taking on Mr Trump. 
Once considered one of the Republican Party's brightest young prospects, Ms Haley, 51, has seen her profile diminish in recent years.
Born in South Carolina to Punjabi Sikh immigrants, Ms Haley became the youngest governor in the country in 2009.
She earned national attention in 2015 after calling for the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Capitol.
Despite saying she was ""not a fan"" of Mr Trump in 2016, she later accepted his nomination to be the US ambassador to the United Nations, a tenure marked by her dramatic exit from a UN Security Council meeting as a Palestinian envoy was speaking.
Her campaign, which includes a call for mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old, stresses the need for ""a new generation"" of US leaders.
Vivek Ramaswamy, 37, launched his dark-horse White House bid during a late February appearance on the Fox News channel.
An Indian-American biotech entrepreneur with no previous political experience, he was a regular fixture on Fox host Tucker Carlson's daily programme, formerly the most-watched cable news show in the US.
The Harvard and Yale graduate argues the country is in the midst of a national identity crisis driven by a decline in faith, patriotism and meritocracy.
He ran a pharmaceutical company from 2014 to 2021, then co-founded Strive Asset Management, which shirks the ""divisive"" environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) framework and offers itself as an alternative to large firms like Blackrock. He is also the author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.
Following Mr Trump's federal indictment over his alleged mishandling of classified documents, Mr Ramaswamy vowed that, if elected president, he would pardon Mr Trump of any crimes and criticised the rest of the field for not following his lead.
Former two-term Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson announced his run for president during an April interview with ABC News just days after Mr Trump was indicted on criminal charges in New York.
Mr Hutchinson, 72, has said Mr Trump's legal problems are ""a sideshow and distraction"" that should prompt him to withdraw from the race.
The former attorney and businessman was the youngest federal prosecutor in the nation under the Ronald Reagan administration.
He also served two terms in the US House of Representatives, including as a prosecutor in Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, and was George W Bush's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) chief.
Presenting himself as a ""non-Trump"" candidate with experience and a record of leadership across multiple roles, he has vowed to lean into ""common sense, consistent conservatism"".
The former software executive and current North Dakota governor confirmed a run for the White House on 7 June saying: ""If you want more small-town common sense in Washington and our big cities, we'll make that happen.""
The New York Times assessed his candidacy: ""As the leader of his deep-red state, Mr Burgum has overseen a period of significant economic expansion, but he has also assented to staunchly conservative social policies, even as he has downplayed his role in them.""
Former Texas congressman Will Hurd announced he was joining the race in a June appearance on CBS News.
A former undercover CIA officer and cybersecurity executive, Mr Hurd won thrice in a majority Hispanic congressional district that sits on the US-Mexico border. But his centrist positions, particularly on immigration, put him at increasing odds with his party through the Trump years. The 45-year-old left Congress in 2021.
He has said his party cannot afford to nominate ""a lawless, selfish, failed politician like Donald Trump"" and must avoid a ""rematch from hell"" between Mr Trump and Mr Biden.
The conservative talk radio host launched an unsuccessful campaign for California governor in 2021, pledging to repeal mask and vaccine mandates. 
A lawyer who grew up in Los Angeles' South Central neighbourhood, Mr Elder, 71, has slammed Democrats' ""woke"" agenda and the idea of systemic racism. 
He announced his long-shot 2024 presidential bid by tweeting: ""America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable.""
Perry Johnson, a 75-year-old businessman who tried to run for Michigan governor last year but was disqualified, joined the presidential race in March.
He is touting a plan to reignite the economy by shaving 2% in federal spending every year.
Miami's 45-year-old Cuban-born mayor, Francis Suarez, was the only Hispanic candidate in the race.
Mr Suarez launched his bid one day after Mr Trump, who he did not vote for in 2016 or 2020, appeared in his city to face federal charges related to his handling of classified documents. Trump supporters were seen verbally berating the mayor.
He was the first to drop out of the race, on 29 August, after failing to make the stage for the first Republican debate.
A business executive from Texas, Ryan Binkley is also a Christian pastor.
He has said he ""heard calls from the Lord about what's needed"" and will prioritise ""solutions for the country"".
Glenn Youngkin: The Virginia governor, who scored an upset victory in 2021 in a state that has trended Democratic in recent years, is reportedly reconsidering a run after previously saying he was not.
Liz Cheney: The daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney was once a rising star in the party but lost her seat in the House of Representatives in 2021 over her fierce opposition to Mr Trump.
Greg Abbott: The Texas governor has routinely waded into national debates on immigration, abortion and gun rights.
Mike Pompeo: The former secretary of state to Mr Trump toured early primary states but announced he would not run in April.
Chris Sununu: The moderate Republican, who has been a popular governor for the state of New Hampshire since 2017, said he will not seek his party's nomination. 
Larry Hogan: The moderate former governor of Democrat-friendly Maryland said he did not want to be part of a crowded field that helps elect Mr Trump again.
Ted Cruz: The Texas senator placed second in the Republican primary for the 2016 presidential election behind Mr Trump but has said he will run for re-election to the Senate in 2024.
Rick Scott: The Florida senator has frequently exchanged vitriol with President Biden but says he too will run for re-election to the Senate.

Canadian 'poison seller' Kenneth Law faces more charges,"Police in Canada have brought an additional 12 charges against a man accused of supplying a poisonous chemical to people who died by suicide.
Kenneth Law, 57, from Toronto had already been charged in May this year with two counts of counselling or aiding suicide in Canada.
Police think Mr Law may have sent more than 1,200 parcels containing lethal substances to around 40 countries.
British detectives say 88 people in the UK who bought from Mr Law later died.
The latest charges, which are also for counselling or aiding suicide, relate to deaths in the Canadian province of Ontario. The dead range in age from 16 to 36.
Eleven police agencies in Ontario are now involved in what Inspector Simon James of York Regional Police said was a ""very active and very complex"" investigation.
Detectives were ""sharing information with law enforcement on a global scale"", he said, adding: ""We will not tolerate criminal actions by those who prey on vulnerable people in our communities.""
Canadian detectives said Mr Law had run a number of websites offering equipment and substances to help people end their lives.  
The charges come days after the National Crime Agency (NCA) in London said Mr Law was known to have sent packages to 272 people in the UK. 
British police said that 88 of those recipients later died, although they could not confirm that a toxic substance was the direct cause of each death.
On Friday NCA deputy director Craig Turner said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the loved ones of those who have died. They are being supported by specially trained officers from police forces.""
The agency said it was conducting an investigation into ""potential criminal offences committed in the UK"".
Tom Parfett, from Maidenhead, was 22 when he ended his own life in October 2021 after buying the chemical from Mr Law.
His father David Parfett told BBC News last week that he was angry at the failures of police to stop the trade in dangerous substances.
""It's important for families to understand what has happened and why policing worldwide allowed this scale of deaths despite clear warning signs,"" he said.
Mr Parfett said he feared there were other suppliers out there and unregulated websites promoting suicide.

Paul Whelan: US ex-marine seen in Russian labour camp video,"Paul Whelan, an American convicted of espionage in Russia who has always called himself a political hostage, has been seen in video footage for the first time in three years.
Arrested in 2018 in Moscow, where he had travelled for a friend's wedding, the former US marine was handed a 16-year sentence after a closed trial.
The US government designates Mr Whelan as ""wrongfully detained"".
The video was filmed at a labour camp by Kremlin-backed channel RT. 
However, Mr Whelan refused to give an interview. 
For his family, in the US and Canada, it's a first glimpse of him since June 2020, when the BBC filmed his final appearance in a Moscow court. 
""It was good to see him again and so see the fight remains in his eyes. It's good to know Paul remains unbowed,"" David Whelan, Paul's twin, wrote in an email. 
In the video, Mr Whelan is seen lining up with other inmates in the prison yard, stitching together industrial clothing in the prison factory and then in the canteen with a trayload of grey-looking food.  
He had previously told his parents that he was being ""badgered"" into participating in ""Kremlin propaganda"". In the video, although he seems relaxed and even smiles, he clearly tells the camera crew that he won't answer any questions. 
The video was filmed in May, but only just released. 
At the time, he said that prison staff had punished him for refusing to be interviewed, throwing his belongings on the floor and trampling on them. 
The RT crew was at the remote IK-17 camp in the republic of Mordovia not long after the arrest of US journalist Evan Gershkovich at the end of March, which led to the rapid exodus of most foreign reporters from Russia. 
Without producing any evidence, Russia accused the Wall Street Journal correspondent of espionage. The US government quickly designated him, too, as ""wrongfully detained"".
Senior officials have called repeatedly for both men to be released. 
From the moment of his arrest, Paul Whelan believed he would soon be swapped for a high-profile Russian convict in the US.
In calls to me from prison in 2020 and 2021, he explained that was why he never appealed against the guilty verdict. He was always upbeat, convinced he would be freed quickly.
But since then, former US Marine Trevor Reed and US basketball player Brittney Griner have been arrested in Russia, convicted and then released in prisoner swaps.
One of those set free by the US was notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.
The RT video hammers home the idea that Paul Whelan has been ""thrown under the bus"" by his government. The report's release, after three months, looks like Kremlin pressure on the US government to make whatever concessions Russia is seeking. 
Now in his fifth year as a prisoner, Paul Whelan has talked of feeling abandoned. 
When Evan Gershkovich was arrested, on the same charge of spying, the Whelan family felt that Paul was ""rattled like never before"", afraid he'd be overlooked again. 
Recent speculation has suggested that the Kremlin is demanding the return of undercover agents, known as ""illegals"", arrested in the US and Europe, or Russians convicted of cybercrimes.
The US and Kremlin confirm only that they are in touch. 
David Whelan told the BBC he thought the US government was moving slowly, still unsure how best to respond. 
""Unfortunately, it's not clear what the US government is waiting for - finding a concession, deciding to use a concession - nor does it help Paul that he has to wait for their action in a labour camp.""
In July, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said his government was prepared to ""do anything"" to get the two men home, but that there was, as yet, no ""clear pathway to a resolution"".

Johnny Kitagawa: J-pop talent agency boss told to quit over predator's abuse,"The late star-maker Johnny Kitagawa's niece must resign as head of the talent agency that he allegedly used to sexually abuse aspiring pop stars in Japan, investigators have said.
The agency was also told to compensate Kitagawa's victims, whose accounts featured in a BBC documentary in March.
Johnny and Associates apologised after the coverage led more people to come forward saying they had been abused.
But victims said Johnny and Associates needed to do more to make amends.
Kitagawa was arguably the most influential figure in Japan's entertainment industry. His agency has held a near-monopoly on Japanese boy bands for decades.
Allegations of sexual exploitation had dogged his career - some were proven in a civil court - but he never faced charges. He continued recruiting and training teenage boys until his death four years ago, at the age of 87.
His death was a national event - even Japan's prime minister at the time sent condolences.
Family management at the agency ""is one of the biggest causes of governance failure"" that caused the abuse to persist for decades, according to the independent investigators, who released their report on Tuesday.
Therefore, replacing Kitagawa's niece Julie Keiko Fujishima as president and CEO is ""necessary"", they said, adding this would also allow Johnny and Associates to restructure its leadership.
The panel, composed of Japan's former prosecutor general Makoto Hayashi, a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist, were appointed by the agency to investigate the allegations independently. They interviewed 41 people, including 23 victims as well as Ms Fujishima.
They found that Kitagawa abused a ""large number"" of young men ""extensively"" from the 1950s, through the 1970s when Johnny and Associates was set up, until the 2010s.
Results of a UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights released in early August likewise found that Kitagawa had molested hundreds of boys and that the working environment in Japanese entertainment enables sexual predators to act with impunity.
The BBC documentary in March detailed allegations from several teenage victims who worked for Kitagawa's all-male agency.  Since then, several other alleged victims have come forward.
There was no immediate response from the agency or Ms Fujishima to the findings of the investigation or its recommendation that she leave her post.
The panel said Ms Fujishima must have known about the abuse but did nothing about it.
""Overall, we found the statement [by Ms Fujishima] that she 'didn't know' at the time to be a lie,"" Mr Hayashi said.

As Hurricane Idalia makes its way towards Florida's Big Bend, residents are taking as many precautions as possible to shield themselves from the impact. 
Here, volunteers are seen placing hurricane shutters at the Cedar Key Fire Station ahead of the arrival of the storm.
Cedar Key is one of the regions projected to be hit with the highest storm surge - up to 15ft.
Twenty-eight counties out of Florida's 67 are under some form of evacuation order, impacting more than 1.5 million people in the Sunshine State. 
To prepare, some Floridians, like Nazih Tageddine from Clearwater Beach, spent their Tuesday afternoon wrapping cellophane around their gas pumps to prevent them from being damaged in the rain, as Idalia passes through.
Others, like Edgar Rocha (L) and Paul Xy, filled sandbags - a tool commonly used in hurricane preparations to help divert water away from homes and businesses.
The National Weather Service has given its latest update on the status of Idalia. Here's what they said:
Jamie Rhome of the National Hurricane Center has told BBC News that the seriousness of the incoming hurricane may be beyond the scope of understanding for some Floridians.
""For some communities [this] is probably going to be worse than they're envisioning, because so few people understand the power of a major hurricane,"" he said, referring to residents of the Big Bend region and cities like Tallahassee and Tampa. 
A storm surge of 10-15ft (4.5m) ""is hard for a lot of people to fathom and envision"", he says. 
Rhome, who is 6ft tall, asked BBC audiences to imagine another one or more people standing on his shoulders to get a picture of the expected depth of some floodwaters.
Idalia is not the only major system currently surging across the Atlantic. Hurricane Franklin is also out there, and is producing winds of 125 mph (200km/h)
Franklin was declared the first major Atlantic hurricane of the season on Monday. It was initially deemed to be a Category 4 storm threatening to bring heavy swells to Bermuda
and the US east coast throughout the week.
According to the National Hurricane Center, ""life-threatening surf and rip currents"" are ongoing along the US's east coast, and a tropical storm warning has been issued for Bermuda.
However, the latest public advisory issued by the hurricane centre says that the storm is expected to weaken in the coming days and has been downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane.
The National Hurricane Center warns that a storm surge could be has high as 15ft (4.5m).
To put it into perspective, that is about half the length of the famous London double-decker red buses.
If the 7ft 1in NBA hall-of-famer Shaquille O'Neal stood on his own shoulders - he would still be underwater.
A two storey house is usually about 20-25 ft tall.

Reporting from Tampa, Florida
There’s an eerie
late afternoon feeling on the streets of Tampa, Florida. 
A light rain is
falling and the wind has only just started to pick up.
Normally this would
be the start of rush hour. There are a few vehicles on the roads, but most
downtown shops have shut and the sidewalks are empty.
Idalia has caused
flooding in Cuba and is already lashing parts of Florida, but here the worst weather
is expected to come overnight into tomorrow. A potential storm surge could come
any time through Wednesday afternoon.
People here are watching and waiting.
This video shows
the incredible weather phenomenon known as St Elmo's fire.
The near-constant eruptions of purple bolts of light was filmed from a MacDill Air Force Base aircraft as it flew through the heavily charged Tampa skies.
Like lightning, St Elmo's fire emits a glowing discharge of ionised air.
The air base said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the
luminous plasma is created in an atmospheric electric field. 
The impending arrival of Hurricane Idalia has forced the mandatory
evacuation of military families and non-essential staff from MacDill Air Force
Base.
MacDill is home to two combatant commands: the US Central Command and
the US Special Operations Command.
It also houses more than two dozen other military units.
The air base
confirmed all its aircraft on site had been ""evacuated/secured""
before Idalia makes landfall.
Here's a quick recap of that update from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis:
Officials say they are concerned that some residents may not be taking the warnings seriously because it has been generations since a similar threat loomed in the Big Bend region. 
""You really
gotta go back to the late 1800s to find a storm of this magnitude that will
enter where this one looks like it's going to enter tomorrow,"" says DeSantis. 
""So we don’t
really have historical analogue in anybody’s memory, so it looks like its going
to cause a lot of damage. That’s just the reality.""
Kevin Guthrie of the Florida
Division of Emergency Management said residents should expect to see a ""historical flood surge up into the Big Bend area"".
He notes that the possibility of 15ft (4.5m) flood surge, which is 3ft (1m) higher than the predictions for Hurricane Ian at Fort Myers Beach in 2022.
DeSantis ended the press conference by once again warning Florida residents to ""be ready for impact"".
State police and transport authorities will shut down bridges to all traffic once winds hit 40mph (65km/h), says DeSantis.
At winds that high, ""those bridges will not be safe to traverse,"" the governor says. 
He also says hotels have been instructed to let guests bring their pets with them, the governor says, while each county will also have at least one pet-friendly shelter.
DeSantis says that residents that don't leave tonight, will not be able to do so until the storm passes later on Wednesday.
The major impact of the storm is expected to arrive on Wednesday morning.
""If you hunker down tonight, it's
going to be too nasty tomorrow morning"" to evacuate, he said.
Emergency rescue crews are ""not
going to be able to get there until after the storm has passed,"" he says, asking people to consider the safety of their family as they make their plan.
""You don’t need
to travel hundreds of miles away, you don’t need to outrun the storm,"" he continued, advising people to simply seek higher ground.
There are now 28 counties under evacuation orders. 
If the storm hits at high tide, the surge could reach as high as 15 feet (4.5m). 
""If you are there when that hits it's going to be very difficult to survive that,"" he says.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is at the podium for his next update.
Hurricane Idalia is now about 190 miles (305 km) southwest of Tampa and is intensifying, he says.
Forecast models are in agreement that the storm has shifted westward and will hit parts of the state that are further north.
DeSantis warns the Big Bend area is definitely going to be hit by Idalia, and could be caught in the eye of the storm.
We're expecting another news conference from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and his top officials as they brace for Idalia to make landfall.
DeSantis is currently in Tallahassee, the state capital. The city is now likely to be impacted by Idalia, with the most recent forecasts showing the hurricane has shifted westward.

Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates.
Western Cuba was
hit by the start of the storm overnight, and local authorities declared alerts
in several of the country's western provinces.
Thousands of people
were evacuated from flooded villages and damaged homes, according to reports.
A small fishing
village an hour's drive south of Havana has been soaked in brown floodwaters, the
Reuters news agency reports. In Pinar del Rio, where tobacco is produced, some
60% of the province was without power.
According to
Granma, a Cuban newspaper, preliminary data suggests that more than 4,000
people were impacted by power outages due to heavy winds caused by the storm.
Reservoirs were also reported to have been filled up rapidly in the early hours, with some reaching more than 60% of their capacity.
The Cuyaguateje river was reported to breach its banks and cut off several nearby towns.
The National Weather Service says it may issue an extreme wind warning as the forecast for Idalia's path and impact grows clearer.
Extreme wind warnings are issued when hurricane-force winds are imminent or happening now, with sustained speeds of up to 115 mph (185 km/h) or greater.
The NWS adds that those under such a warning must ""take immediate shelter in an interior portion of a well-built structure"".
Idalia is now a
Category 2 hurricane.
The National
Hurricane Center has just upgraded the storm classification.
It says a life-threatening storm
surge and hurricane conditions are expected along portions of the Gulf Coast of
Florida tonight and Wednesday.
A Category 2 hurricane travels with winds of up to 110 mph (177 km/h) that can cause extensive damage.
Franz Strasser
Reporting from Washington DC
Taking a look at
all hurricanes making landfall in the US since 1911, you can see that the
number has gone from 12 in the 1970s to 19 in the 2000s and 2010s.
But it has not been
dramatically higher recently than the 20th century average of roughly 17 per
decade.
What is happening more, experts say,
is that warming waters are leading to more hurricanes over the Atlantic
strengthening to major hurricanes, those Category 3 and higher. And not all of
them have to make landfall to have an impact on US residents living in coastal
areas.
Most of
Florida's 21 million residents, along with tens of
millions of others in Georgia and South Carolina, are under warnings
of some kind in anticipation of Hurricane Idalia.
These are pretty
sizeable figures to comprehend. But, while we wait for the storm to hit, the
majority of information we have is based on just that: numbers.
And while some are
certain and others approximate, it is important to get our heads round those
key figures. Let's break them down:
At the White House,
President Biden has said he assured Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in a phone
call last night that his state will get whatever help it needs.
“We’re worried
about the ocean surge,” Biden told reporters ahead of a bilateral meeting with
Costa Rica's president.
He said that his
team was monitoring Idalia's path ""hour to hour"".
“We’re there as
long as it takes, and we’ll make sure they have everything they need,” he added.
It marks a rare conversation between
Biden, a Democrat, and DeSantis, a Republican who is in the 2024 race for
president.
Mike Wendling
Reporting from Tampa, Florida
The word “evacuation”
brings to mind long lines of traffic and people struggling to move hundreds of
miles inland.
But that’s
not the situation here in Tampa, where large parts of this metro area of three million people are out of reach of Idalia’s
potentially deadly storm surge. 
The city is divided
into five coloured zones, but only Zone A, shown in red above and comprising low-lying
areas closest to the water, is under a mandatory evacuation order. That said, others are being encouraged to seek shelter, particularly if they live in mobile homes.
“You don’t always
know what’s safe or not, because Tampa’s so big,” said Chanel Jay, who was hunkering
down in a shelter about a 10 minute drive away from her home. 
Right now
the worst winds and storm surges are forecast to hit sparsely populated areas
further to the north. 
But things can change quickly and Chanel, who is facing her
second hurricane since moving from Pennsylvania, says she isn’t taking any
chances.
“Florida weather
has a mind of its own,” she says.
Idalia is projected to hit part of the Gulf coast that has not seen such a major hurricane since the mid-1800s.
Hurricane Idalia could bring ""catastrophic"" waves to coastal areas. A super moon could make things worse.

Police seek help identifying child's body found in German river,"Police have asked for help identifying a child, believed to be aged five to six, whose body was found in a river in Germany more than a year ago.
The boy's body was discovered in May 2022 in the state of Bavaria.
International police agency Interpol said it had published details of the case in hopes of finding the boy's name and determining ""the suspicious circumstances surrounding his death"".
""Someone, somewhere knows something about this boy,"" it said.
""Whether he was the victim of trafficking, abduction or violence,"" Interpol secretary-general Jurgen Stock said the group was determined to ""shed light on his death"". 
This article contains details some readers may find distressing.
It is the first time Interpol has gone public with a so-called black notice, seeking information about an unidentified body, for a child.
It marks a widening of a landmark campaign the organisation launched in May, dubbed Operation Identify Me, which sought information about 22 women murdered in Europe whose identities have never been discovered.
The black notices released as part of the campaign are normally only circulated internally among Interpol's network of police forces throughout the world. 
Interpol said the boy's body was found wrapped in foil in the River Danube, weighed down with a flagstone slab on 19 May 2022.  
As part of the black notice, they have published a reconstruction of his face.
Interpol told the BBC it was ""unusual to have a child's body go unidentified for this long"", and said this suggested he may have come from another country.
Members of the public have been urged to contact German police with information.
Since Operation Identify Me was launched in May, police have received more than 500 tip-offs about unidentified women murdered in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
This includes possible names of victims, and potential leads about clothing and jewellery the women were wearing.
The campaign was sparked by the unsolved murder of a woman in Amsterdam, whose body found in a wheelie bin in a river in 1999.

Biden names 10 drugs for Medicare price negotiations,"President Joe Biden has announced 10 drugs that will be targeted in government price negotiations to make them more affordable for the elderly. 
Mr Biden's Inflation Reduction Act gave Medicare - the government healthcare programme for the over-65s - the power to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers for the first time.
The negotiations mean older Americans could see cheaper drug costs by 2026.
The 10 drugs include expensive diabetes, cancer and heart medications.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Biden administration said direct negotiations between the government and drug manufacturers would allow elderly Americans to get a ""better deal"" on prescriptions. 
""For far too long, Americans have paid more for prescription drugs than any major economy,"" Mr Biden said. ""Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is delivering on another significant milestone in implementing President Biden's historic law to lower health care and prescription drug costs and ushering in a new era for American seniors.""
The move is likely to face opposition from drug companies and Republican lawmakers, who have already criticised the measure. 
A majority of adults 65 years or older - about 50 million - use Medicare health insurance for prescription drug coverage. Still, nearly a quarter of older Americans struggle to afford their medications, according to non-profit health research organisation KFF. 
The White House said elderly Americans spent $3.4bn (£2.7bn) in 2022 in out-of-pocket costs for the 10 drugs, which include blood thinner Eliquis and popular diabetes treatment Jardiance. 
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services selected the 10 drugs because they were the most costly, they do not have generic competitors, and because millions depend on them to ""treat life-threatening conditions including diabetes, heart failure, and cancer"", the White House said. 
The government will begin to negotiate prices for the drugs in 2023, with new costs set to go into effect in 2026. 
Drug price negotiations are a part of broader Biden administration efforts to lower healthcare costs for Americans. Before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed last year, the Medicare programme received discounts for some of the 10 drugs, but was not allowed to directly negotiate prices with manufacturers. 
Mr Biden is expected to deliver a speech on healthcare costs at 14:00 EDT (19:00 GMT) on Tuesday. 
Major drug manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson and Merck, have already filed lawsuits to block Medicare negotiation of drug prices, arguing they are unconstitutional. 
Several Republican politicians have also expressed opposition, claiming the talks could hamper pharmaceutical innovation because of lower incentives for drug companies. 
The public, meanwhile, largely supports the measure. According to a 2021 KFF poll, 83% of those surveyed were in favour of Medicare negotiating directly with drug makers.

Rzeszow: Legionnaires' disease kills 14 in Poland,"Fourteen people have died and more than 150 cases have been confirmed following an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in south-eastern Poland.
Many of those infected have been taken to hospital since the outbreak was detected last week. 
Nine new cases were diagnosed on Tuesday.
Authorities are still checking how the legionella bacteria, which causes the disease, got into the water supply in the Rzeszow city and its surroundings. 
The outbreak's location initially raised concerns because Rzeszow is the hub for military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine and hosts a large US military presence.
""We have not identified any information that we are dealing with sabotage,"" Stanislaw Zaryn, the Polish government's plenipotentiary for information security, told the Polsat News broadcaster.
He said the special services wanted to rule out sabotage, given the outbreak's location.
Legionnaires' disease is a serious lung infection transmitted by inhaling tiny droplets of infected water - not by drinking contaminated water. It is not contagious. 
People can become infected when taking a shower, flushing a toilet or from an air conditioning system. 
Initial symptoms can be confused with influenza, and the over-50s and those whose immune systems are compromised are particularly vulnerable to the disease. 
Legionnaires' disease is treated through a course of antibiotics.
Most of the people who died were elderly. All were suffering from other chronic illnesses including cancer. 
The investigation to determine the cause of the outbreak is continuing. Initial test samples have proved inconclusive as to the source of the bacteria.
Additional chlorine has been added to the municipal water supply system as a decontaminant, and authorities have warned residents to boil water before drinking it.
The bacterium was first identified in 1977 as the cause of an outbreak of severe pneumonia at an American Legion convention centre in Philadelphia a year earlier.

Hermoso kiss sparks sexism debate beyond football,"It has been a tumultuous week for women's football, as it deals with the aftermath of Luis Rubiales kissing Spanish national star Jenni Hermoso on the lips at the Women's World Cup final. 
The row over the Spanish football president's actions, broadcast and seen by millions, has spilled over well beyond Spain and the sport, and struck a chord with women around the world.
Spain's top criminal court on Monday launched a preliminary investigation into whether his actions amounted to a crime of sexual assault.
Rubiales has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. He has repeatedly stated that the kiss was consensual and that he is the victim of a ""social assassination"". 
Hermoso has stated there was no consent. The Spanish football federation, however, later questioned her claim and threatened legal action for ""lies"".
Teresa Parker from Women's Aid, a charity that supports women and children facing abuse, says the way the incident has played out so far has resonated with many women.

Luis Rubiales: Spanish federation president kisses Hermoso during ceremony
""This is exactly why many women do not come forward to report harassment or abuse,"" she said, adding that what had happened would seem to many to go ""beyond gaslighting"". 
""We are being asked to ignore what you can see on film, and to dismiss a woman when she says she didn't consent. It is an outrageous situation.""
Gaslighting is a form of emotional manipulation, where the victim - of any gender - is deliberately fed false information that makes them doubt their version of events. 
""What we are seeing here is powerful men closing ranks to protect one another with a deliberate and sustained campaign of gaslighting and victim-blaming on an international scale,"" claims Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project.
To many people, the presence of video footage leaves little room for doubt about what happened.
""The irony is that women are so often told an allegation is meaningless without evidence,"" says Ms Bates. 
""But what we can see from this case is that even when the evidence is iron-clad the woman is disbelieved anyway, so we really can't win.
""This happened on an international stage, witnessed by millions... and yet both Rubiales and the entire football institution told her she was wrong.""
She says the message that sent to Hermoso, and the wider world, was ""horrifying"".
""It doesn't matter who you are or what you achieve, even at the very pinnacle of your career, even with all the evidence and witnesses: we will still crush you if you dare to stand up against a powerful man.""
This video can not be played
Watch: The Rubiales World Cup kiss row... in 75 seconds
Ms Bates says other women will look at what happened and ask ""what possible chance do I have of being believed?"".
A BBC survey in 2017 found half of British women have been sexually harassed at work or a place of study. More than 60% of those said they did not report it.
""What we're seeing happening to Hermoso here on the world stage is so devastatingly familiar for millions of women,"" says Ms Bates. 
""The man who takes advantage of a work event, a Christmas party, a handshake, a photo, to lean in too close, put their hand lower than they should. 
""And then the self-doubt about whether you're over-reacting, or misinterpreting it, and the pain of other people telling you you're making something out of nothing.""
Many in Spain are standing by Hermoso, releasing statements, resigning and refusing to play. Regional leaders within the Spanish football federation have called on Rubiales to resign.
Others continue to defend Rubiales. His mother has gone on hunger strike.
Ms Bates says the more people who ""stand united in support... the greater chance we have of creating a world where this behaviour is not tolerated"".
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, football presenter and journalist Semra Hunter says she has never seen Spanish society ""come together so unanimously... and agree this was completely inappropriate behaviour"". 
""It's not just about a kiss, it's about so much more,"" she says. ""This is a reflection, as well, of wider society and how sexual abuse and sexual violence and misogyny and machismo has been normalised for far too long.""  
She says women had never felt safe enough to speak openly ""because normally they would be shamed or humiliated or wouldn't be believed"".
Rubiales faces a possible legal inquiry as well as an internal investigation. The repercussions on his career are yet to be decided.

Haiti media guide,"Radio is Haiti's key news medium. The country has more than 400 radio and TV stations, but only half operate legally.
Haiti's national radio and TV broadcaster RTNH is the primary state media outlet. Privately-owned media are heavily influenced by the interests of their owners, and tend to censor themselves. 
Newspaper circulations are small and are impeded by affordability and low literacy. However, newspaper websites are popular among Haitians abroad.
The media reflect a range of views, but the work of journalists is hampered by threats, violence and government interference, says Freedom House. 
There were 4 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 35% of the population (Internetworldstats.com). Facebook is the leading social media platform.

Haiti country profile,"Haiti became the world's first black-led republic and the first independent Caribbean state when it threw off French colonial control and slavery in the early 19th Century.
But independence came at a crippling cost. It had to pay reparations to France, which demanded compensation for former slave owners. The 19th Century ""independence debt"" was not paid off until 1947. There have been recent calls for France to repay the money.
Chronic instability, dictatorships and natural disasters in recent decades have left it as the poorest nation in the Americas.
An earthquake in 2010 killed more than 200,000 people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure and the economy. 
A UN peacekeeping force was put in place in 2004 to help stabilize the country, and only withdrew in 2017.
In July 2021, President Jovenel Moïse was assasinated by unidentified gunmen in the capital, Port-au-Prince. Amid political stalemate, the country continues to be wracked by unrest and gang violence.
Acting President and Prime Minister: Ariel Henry
Following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021 by unidentified gunmen, the interim prime minister Claude Joseph assumed control as acting president but then yielded the presidency and prime ministership to prime minister-designate Ariel Henry.
On 21 December 2022, Henry along with representatives of political parties, civil society organizations and private sector signed an agreement to hold the general elections in 2023, with the new government taking office in February 2024.
Critics have accused him of involvement with Joseph Felix Badio, one of the main suspects in the assassination of President Moïse. He has dismissed the allegations of his involvement in the killing of Moïse as ""fake news"".
Henry has stated that he was willing to hand over suspects to the United States, and stated that he supported appointing a judge from another country to oversee the case independently in Haiti.
Radio is Haiti's leading news medium and there are hundreds of local, privately-owned stations.
The media reflect a range of views but the work of journalists is hampered by threats and violence, press watchdogs say.
Some key dates in Haiti's history:
1492 - Christopher Columbus lands and names the island Hispaniola, or Little Spain. 
1496 - Spain establishes first European settlement in western hemisphere at Santo Domingo, now capital of Dominican Republic.

Kuwait media guide,"The authorities put limits on media freedom, and the law criminalises criticism of the emir and the government, or content that is deemed to insult Islam, says Freedom House. 
State TV and radio operate alongside private broadcasters. Pan-Arab satellite stations are widely watched.
The press is relatively open, but newspapers must be licensed by the information ministry. 
BBC World Service broadcasts on FM in Kuwait City (in Arabic on 90.1, English on 100.1).
Internet use is very high. There were 4.3 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 99% of the population (Internetworldstats.com).
Reporters Without Borders says a vaguely-worded cyber-crime law that took effect in 2016 poses a threat to internet users who post critical content.
Certain websites that are deemed to be immoral or politically sensitive are blocked, says Freedom House.

New Zealand birds: Takahe facing extinction find new home in sanctuary,"Two flightless takahe were released at a New Zealand sanctuary in the latest effort to stop some of the world's rarest birds becoming extinct.
The pair, Waitaa and Bendigo, sprinted out of their cages to cheers from the crowd at Zealandia in Wellington.
Last week, 18 takahe were released in mountains in South Island to try to boost a small population in the wild.
Due to predators, takahe were thought extinct at the end of the 19th Century but a small number were found in 1948.
Their discovery in remote grasslands of the Murchison Mountains on the South Island sparked conservation efforts that have raised the population to close to 500.
Takahe are plump birds with a strong red beak, stout legs and bright blue and green feathers. They grow up to the size of a large hen and can weigh as much as 3kg (6.6lb). They are often mistaken for pukeko swamp hens that are visibly thinner, according to New Zealand's Department of Conservation (Doc).
The takahe breed only once a year, raising one to two chicks, and live up to 18 years in the wild and 22 years in sanctuaries. They live on a high-fibre diet of starchy leaves and seeds.
Waitaa and Bendigo join an existing pair of takahe already released at North Island's Zealandia sanctuary, which is ringed by a predator-exclusion fence. 
New Zealand's native birds evolved before the ascent of mammals and are vulnerable to predation by land predators introduced by human settlers.
The release last week of nine breeding-age pairs at Greenstone Station in the Lake Whakatipu area was an attempt to establish a third wild population on South Island where the birds have a special cultural and spiritual significance. 
The other wild populations are in Fiordland's Murchison Mountains and in Kahurangi National Park, where takahe were first released in 2018.
""After decades of hard work to increase the takahe population, it's rewarding to now be focusing on establishing more wild populations, but it comes with challenges,"" said Doc's Deidre Vercoe after last week's release.
""Establishing new wild native species populations can take time and success is not guaranteed. If we want takahe to thrive, we need to explore new sites and learn as much as we can to protect the birds now and into the future."" 
Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, consider the takahe as being taonga - a treasure that should be protected.
Conservationists have long worked to control the populations of the takahe's predators - stoats, feral cats, ferrets and rats.
Before the most recent wildlife release in Greenstone Station, conservationists installed 45 ferret traps and 25 cat traps.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources considers the South Island takahe as endangered or three steps from extinction. It has marked the North Island takahe as extinct.

Kuwait country profile,"Oil-rich Kuwait is a tiny country nestling at the top of the Gulf. Flanked by powerful neighbours Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, its strategic location and massive oil reserves make it one of the world's richest countries per capita. 
A conservative state with a Sunni Muslim majority and a US ally, Kuwait stands out from the other Gulf monarchies for having the most open political system. 
But tensions have persisted between parliament and the cabinet, controlled by the ruling Al-Sabah family, and the government is facing increasing calls for radical political reform from the opposition. 
Emir: Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah
Sheikh Nawaf took over on the death of his half-brother Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah in September 2020.
Sheikh Sabah reigned from 2006, having previously served as a highly influential foreign minister for 40 years. He maintained Kuwait's pro-Western stance and pursued a policy of cautious reform, which Sheikh Nawaf, aged 83 when he ascended the throne, is expected to continue.
The authorities place limits on media freedom, and legislation provides for punishments for criticism of the emir and the government. State broadcasters operate alongside privately-owned outlets. Internet use is among the highest in the region.
Some key dates in Kuwait's history:
1700s - Nomadic tribes from central Arabia settle in the bay of Kuwait City, among them the Al-Sabah family whose descendants now rule Kuwait. 
1899 - British protectorate: Britain assumes control of foreign and defence policy amid fears of an expanding Ottoman Empire. 
1930s - Oil: The discovery of massive oil reserves revolutionises the country's economy.
1961- Kuwait gains independence from Britain.
1963 - British military intervention forces Iraq to abandon its territorial claims and recognize Kuwait's independence. Kuwait becomes the first Arab country in the Gulf to establish an elected parliament.
1990-91 - First Gulf War: Iraqi invasion leads to a US-led military campaign to liberate Kuwait. A US-led and UN-backed bombing aerial campaign begins in Kuwait and Iraq. By late February 1991, allied forces reach Kuwait City. Iraqi forces torch oil wells as they pull out. 
2003 - Tens of thousands of soldiers converge on the Kuwait-Iraq border for a US-led military campaign to disarm and oust Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in Second Gulf War. 
2003 - Political reform: Emir issues a landmark decree separating the post of prime minister from the crown prince.
2005 - Kuwaiti women win the right to vote and run in parliamentary elections.
2012 - Unprecedented protests call for government reforms. 
2015 - Kuwait and four other Gulf states take part in Saudi-led air strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen.
2020 September - Sheikh Nawaf takes over as emir on the death of his half-brother Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber al-Sabah.

Saudi Arabia media guide,"Saudi Arabia's tightly-controlled media offer unwavering support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and King Salman, routinely ignoring negative reporting about the kingdom
Key media owners are said to have handed over significant assets to the state during MBS's so-called anti-corruption initiative in 2017, leaving the ownership status of major outlets unclear
Although outlets are adopting a more ""modern"" approach, and more women are involved in the media on and off screen, media freedom organisations continue to note a decline in freedoms
Moves are under way to turn the kingdom into a global media hub, with the relocation of key outlets from abroad and a diversification into digital platforms
Saudis are huge consumers of social media, and the country is said to be the world's biggest user of YouTube
Religious figures are among the most followed social media personalities, despite having been sidelined by MBS in his attempt to curb the influence of hardline Salafi clerics and those affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood
Social media manipulation is rife as campaigns to defend the kingdom and rebuff criticism routinely involve influencers, inauthentic behaviour and disinformation.
There were 35 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 98% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com).

Saudi Arabia country profile,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is one of the main players in the Arab world. 
Its stature is built on its prestige as the custodian of the birthplace of Islam, and its status as an one of the world's largest oil producers.
Its importance as an oil exporter has made economic interdependence with the West - where the main consumer demand is found - a necessity. 
This, in turn, has led to strong political and military relationships that at times have been a source of awkwardness for both sides.
It stands out for its espousal of a puritan version of Sunni Islam, including harsh punishments such as public beheadings, and its restrictions on the rights of women.
In recent years, there has been a growing regional rivalry with Iran.
King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud
The Al Saud dynasty holds a monopoly of political power. King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud ascended the throne in January 2015 following the death of his half-brother Abdullah. 
He has been part of the ruling group of princes for decades, and has continued the main thrusts of Saudi strategic policy - maintaining the US alliance and working towards energy market stability.
Crown prince: Mohammed bin Salman
King Salman made his son Mohammed bin Salman heir-apparent in June 2017, and the latter now controls all the major levers of power.
There are no democratic institutions in Saudi Arabia, with the systematic repression of human rights activists, women's rights activists, journalists and political dissidents.
The crown prince was personally linked to the assassination of Saudi Arabian Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who had criticised the Saudi government. He has denied involvement in the killing.
Saudi investors are major players in the pan-Arab TV industry, but the country has one of the region's most tightly-controlled media environments.
The government openly acknowledges that widespread internet filtering takes place. It targets ""pornographic"", Islam-related, human rights and political sites.
Saudi Arabia has the highest per-capita YouTube use of any country in the world. It is reportedly home to more than 40% of all active Twitter users in the Arab region.  
Some key events in Saudi history: 
1727 - Muhammad bin Saud, founder of the Saudi royal dynasty, joins forces with religious leader Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, founder of the Wahhabi movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam.
1932 - The Kingdom of Hejaz and Sultanate of Nejd - the areas controlled by Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud, known in the West as Ibn Saud -  are unified under the name Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
1938 - Oil is discovered and production begins under the US-controlled Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco).
1960 - Saudi Arabia is a founding member of the Opec Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
1972 - Saudi Arabia gains control of 20% of Aramco, lessening US control over Saudi oil. 
1973 - Saudi Arabia leads an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the October Yom Kippur War with Egypt and Syria. Oil prices quadruple. 
1979 - Extremists seize the Grand Mosque of Mecca; the government regains control after 10 days and those captured are executed. 
1980 - Saudi Arabia takes full control of Aramco from the US. 
1981 May - Saudi Arabia is a founder member of the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council). 
1990 - Saudi Arabia condemns Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and asks the US to intervene. 
1991 - Saudi Arabia is involved in both air attacks on Iraq and the ground forces that liberate Kuwait. 
2001 11 September - 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in attacks on New York and Washington are Saudi nationals.
2005 - World Trade Organization gives the green light to Saudi Arabia's membership following 12 years of talks. 
2010 - US officials confirm plan to sell $60bn worth of arms to Saudi Arabia - the biggest single arms deal in US history. 
2012 - Saudi women athletes allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time.
2014 - Saudi Arabia and four other Arab states join with US in air strikes against Islamic State militant strongholds in Syria.
2015 - Saudi Arabia launches campaign of air strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.
2017 - Ban on women driving formally lifted.
2018 - Public cinema returns, almost 40 years after it was banned as un-Islamic. 
2018 - The killing of emigre reporter Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul causes an international outcry.

Bavarian deputy leader Aiwanger under pressure for old anti-Semitic flyer,"The deputy premier of the German state of Bavaria, Hubert Aiwanger, has been asked to explain his role in a schoolboy anti-Semitic pamphlet.
The populist conservative leader denies writing the Auschwitz pamphlet which mocked the Holocaust but he has admitted having it 35 years ago.
Conservative Premier Markus Söder has asked Mr Aiwanger to reply to 25 questions on the controversy.
Bavaria holds key elections on 8 October.
Mr Söder met the leader of his coalition partner, Freie Wähler (Free Voters), on Tuesday and called for full transparency. 
He said there was ""no place for anti-Semitism in the Bavarian government"".
The state parliament has demanded an emergency statement.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called for clarification too, after the newspaper revelations of Mr Aiwanger's schoolboy activities emerged at the weekend in the left-leaning Süddeutsche Zeitung.
The general secretary of the chancellor's centre-left party, Kevin Kühnert, made clear when Germans talked about anti-Semitism it required ""utmost vigilance and nobody should have a tactical relationship with it"".
When the story of the leaflet first broke, Mr Aiwanger's initial reaction was to claim it was just a politically motivated media campaign against him. Then he simply denied writing it, saying it was someone else. 
The typewritten pamphlet talked of a fictitious competition to find ""who is the biggest traitor to the Fatherland"", with a first prize of a ""free flight through the chimney in Auschwitz"".
The Auschwitz extermination camp was at the heart of the Nazi genocide of six million Jews in World War Two. Of 1.1 million people murdered at Auschwitz, about a million were Jews.
The deputy premier later admitted that ""one or several"" copies of the leaflet were in his schoolbag in Mallersdorf-Pfaffenberg in Lower Bavaria when he was a teenager in the late 1980s. He appeared unable to remember if he had distributed the anti-Semitic material himself but said he found the contents ""disgusting and inhumane"".
His brother, Helmut Aiwanger, said he had written the pamphlet when he was still a boy and now regretted his actions. ""I was totally furious at the time as I'd failed school and was torn apart from my circle of friends.""
Apart from vague speculation from Helmut Aiwanger that his brother was ""possibly"" trying to gather up the leaflets to minimise harm, it is still unclear why the leaflets were in the schoolboy's bag. No information about the subsequent school disciplinary procedure has been released.
Many of Germany's newspapers are asking whether the immature, schoolboy scribblings of a teenager's brother should bring down a politician decades later. But there is universal agreement the pamphlet's content is far from trivial.  
Making jokes about concentration camps is out of bounds even for the far right and can have legal ramifications in Germany, where denying the Holocaust is a crime.
Ordinarily Mr Aiwanger is eloquent and known for his fiery, populist style but in this case he has stayed tight-lipped, answering questions at one press conference simply with a brusque ""next question"". This has not left anyone with an impression of full disclosure or repentance. 
He is not known for expressing anti-Semitic views but he has flirted with rhetoric reminiscent of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), including talk of ""taking back our country"".
He is now under pressure from Bavaria's premier to respond to a situation that appears to be spiralling out of control. 
Mr Söder says he wants to remain in coalition with Mr Aiwanger's party but he is evidently furious this row has blown up so soon before key elections. At a beer-hall election rally in Bavaria he made snide jokes clearly aimed at Mr Aiwanger. 
Free Voters are set to win 11-14% of the vote in six weeks' time but if their support implodes Mr Söder's conservative Christian Social Unionwould be in trouble. 
The Bavarian leader's ambitions for one day taking on the role of German chancellor are already being dashed by poor poll numbers. Without Free Voters his party would have the tricky task of trying to win over the left-leaning Green Party, a hate figure for many Bavarian conservatives. 
With key votes in eastern German states next year and national elections in 2025, what happens in Bavaria in October's election will have a big impact in German politics.
The AfD has reached record poll numbers of more than 20% across Germany, and the conservatives in Bavaria have a difficult balancing act. 
If they stray too far into nationalist territory, as some believe Mr Aiwanger has done, centrist voters will be scared off. But many right-wingers in Bavaria clearly believe they can fight off the AfD by mimicking its far-right rhetoric.
While the political future of the Free Voters leader has come in for scrutiny, so too has the newspaper's handling of the story. 
In its headline, Süddeutsche Zeitung's website reported that the deputy premier was said to have written the pamphlet, although his denial was only carried behind a paywall for subscribers to see it.

Lebanon media guide,"Lebanon's broadcasting scene is developed and lively and reflects the country's pluralism and its divisions.
It was the first Arab country to permit private radio and TV and has become a regional media hub. News websites across the political spectrum are a key information source.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) says ""genuine freedom of expression"" exists but political parties have a ""stranglehold"" and journalism is ""a full-fledged weapon in the political conflict"".
The financial crisis and the effects of the 2020 Beirut port explosion have forced media outlets to cut their staffing and budgets. The Daily Star, Lebanon's only English-language paper, closed in 2021.
Almost all TVs and radios are privately-owned and many are affiliated with political groups. Al-Manar TV is operated by militant group Hezbollah. Take-up of satellite and cable is widespread.
Lebanese TVs are known for hosting some of the most daring cultural and social talks shows in the Middle East. There are dozens of private radio stations. BBC Arabic and Radio France Internationale are carried by partner stations.
There is no large-scale filtering of online content. However, Freedom House said in 2021 that ""the state has started to block more content, often failing to provide transparency about its decisions.""
There were 5.6 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 84% of the population (Internetworldstats.com) and around 5 million active social media users (We Are Social/Hootsuite, 2022).

Lebanon country profile,"With its high literacy rate and traditional mercantile culture, Lebanon has been an important commercial hub for the Middle East.
It has also often been at the centre of Middle Eastern conflicts, despite its small size, because of its borders with Syria and Israel and its uniquely complex communal make-up.
Shia Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Christians and Druze are the main population groups in a country that has been a refuge for the region's minorities for centuries.
President: vacant
The post is currently vacant. After Michel Aoun left the presidency in 2022, prime minister Najib Mikati said he would not be assuming the powers of the presidency, as they would be delegated to the council of ministers as a whole, as per Lebanon's constitution, which does not allow for an interim president.
Prime minister: Najib Mikati
Najib Mikati, Lebanon's richest man, returned to head the government in September 2021, having served as prime minister twice before.
His appointment ended months of political paralysis, as the country struggled with a collapsing economy and nearly two years of protests demanding wholesale political reform.
Lebanon had been without a government since Hassan Diab resigned after a massive blast destroyed Beirut port and the surrounding area in August 2020.
Lebanon's broadcasting scene is developed, lively and diverse, and reflects the country's pluralism and divisions.

Golan Heights profile,"The Golan Heights is  a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, about 60km (40 miles) south-west of Damascus and covers about 1,000 sq km. It has a political and strategic significance which belies its size. 
Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the closing stages of the 1967 Six-Day War. Most of the Syrian Arab inhabitants fled the area during the conflict. 
An armistice line was established and the region came under Israeli military control. Almost immediately Israel began to settle the Golan. 
Syria tried to retake the Golan Heights during the 1973 Middle East war. Despite inflicting heavy losses on Israeli forces, the surprise assault was thwarted. Both countries signed an armistice in 1974 and a UN observer force has been in place on the ceasefire line since 1974. 
Israel unilaterally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US Trump Administration did so unilaterally in March 2019. 
There are more than 30 Israeli settlements in the Golan, which are home to an estimated 20,000 people. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.
The settlers live alongside some 20,000 Syrians, most of them Druze Arabs, who did not flee when the Golan was captured.
Syria has always insisted that it will not agree a peace deal with Israel unless it withdraws from the whole of the Golan. 
Southern Syria and the capital Damascus, about 60 km (40 miles) north, are clearly visible from the top of the Heights while Syrian artillery regularly shelled the whole of northern Israel from 1948 to 1967 when Syria controlled the Heights. 
The heights give Israel an excellent vantage point for monitoring Syrian movements. The topography provides a natural buffer against any military thrust from Syria. 
The area is also a key source of water for an arid region. Rainwater from the Golan's catchment feeds into the Jordan River. 
The land is fertile, and the volcanic soil is used to cultivate vineyards and orchards and raise cattle. The Golan is also home to Israel's only ski resort. 
Syria wants to secure the return of the Golan Heights as part of any peace deal. In late 2003, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said he was ready to revive peace talks with Israel. 
In Israel, the principle of returning the territory in return for peace is already established. During US-brokered peace talks in 1999-2000, then Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak had offered to return most of the Golan to Syria. 
But the main sticking point during the 1999 talks is also likely to bedevil any future discussions. Syria wants a full Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 border. This would give Damascus control of the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee - Israel's main source of fresh water. 
Israel wishes to retain control of Galilee and says the border is located a few hundred metres to the east of the shore. 
A deal with Syria would also involve the dismantling of Jewish settlements in the territory. 
Public opinion in Israel has generally not favoured withdrawal, saying the Heights are too strategically important to be returned.  
Indirect talks between Israel and Syria resumed in 2008, through Turkish government intermediaries, but were suspended following the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert over a corruption inquiry. 
The Israeli government under Binyamin Netanyahu elected in February 2009 indicated that it was determined to take a tougher line over the Golan, and in June 2009 Syria said there was no partner for talks on the Israeli side. 
The US administration of President Barack Obama declared the restarting of talks between Israel and Syria to be one of its main foreign policy goals, but the advent of civil war in Syria in 2011 put paid to any progress. 
Syrian fighting reached the Golan ceasefire lines in 2013, but the resurgent Syrian government felt confident enough to reopen its Golan border crossing to UN observers in October 2018. 
In 2019, US President Donald Trump officially recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Syria criticised the move as ""a blatant attack on its sovereignty"".

Till Lindemann: Police drop investigation of Rammstein star,"Prosecutors in Germany have dropped an investigation into Till Lindemann, the lead singer of Rammstein, following allegations of sexual misconduct.
The investigation was opened in June, after several women came forward to claim they were drugged and recruited to engage in sexual activity.
Lindemann always denied the allegations. His lawyers called them ""without exception untrue"". 
Prosecutors said a lack of evidence led them to drop the investigation.
The women had said they were recruited to engage in sexual activity with the 60-year-old at Rammstein after-show parties. 
Last week, the singer's legal team said that they would ""immediately pursue legal action in response to all such accusations"".
Selby Lynn, a 24-year-old fan from Northern Ireland, told the BBC earlier this year she believed her drink had been spiked, and claimed she had been propositioned by Lindemann for sex at a backstage party in Vilnius, Lithuania.

Shelby Lynn, 24, from Ballymena, went to see Rammstein in Vilnius
She added on social media: ""I'd like to clarify again. Till did NOT touch me. He accepted I did not want to have sex with him. I never claimed he raped me.""
Her allegations prompted other women to come forward on social media with sexual misconduct allegations against Lindemann.
Some said they suspected they were pre-selected on social media for Mr Lindemann, and claimed they were invited to parties before and after the show.
In June, the Berlin public prosecution's office said preliminary proceedings had been initiated against Lindemann, adding that ""several criminal complaints [had been] filed by third parties"".
Following the accusations, the band's Berlin headquarters were vandalised. Windows were broken and graffiti was sprayed reading: ""No stage for perpetrators.""
A petition demanding Rammstein did not play scheduled tour dates in July gathered more than 75,000 signatures, but the shows went ahead.
The German industrial metal group were formed in 1993 and are known for their theatrical shows and controversial lyrics.
They reached the top three in the UK album chart with their two most recent albums, released in 2019 and 2022.

Cuba media guide,"Television, radio, and newspapers are all closely monitored by Cuba's government. Cuba remains the worst country for press freedom in Latin America, says France-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Almost all traditional media are state-controlled and journalists risk harassment and detention over coverage that is deemed to be critical of the authorities or the political system. 
The country's independent press operates outside the law, its publications are considered ""enemy propaganda,"" says US-based NGO Freedom House. 
The US tries hard to reach Cuban audiences. Washington-backed Radio-TV Marti says it provides balanced and uncensored news.
Freedom House says online access is tightly controlled. Most users can only access ""a closely monitored Cuban intranet"", it says. Havana blocks access to some independent news websites.
There were 8.3 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 74% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com).

Cuba country profile,"Cuba's Communist government has survived decades of US sanctions originally intended to topple its first leader Fidel Castro. 
It also defied predictions that it would not survive the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Since the fall of the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Cuba has been a one-party state led by Mr Castro and his successors .
Exploiting the Cold War, he was for decades able to rely on strong Soviet backing, including annual subsidies worth up to $5bn, and succeed in building reputable health and education systems. 
The US and Cuba agreed to begin a process of normalising relations in 2014. 
President: Miguel Diaz-Canel
Miguel Diaz-Canel became president in April 2018 in a handover ending six decades of rule by the Castro family.
Mr Diaz-Canel, aged 57 at the time of his inauguration, is a former engineer who was born after the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power. 
He has promised to maintain the island's one-party system after being chosen as president by parliament.
Cuba has the most repressive media environment in the Americas, says Freedom House. Almost all traditional media are state run.
Online access is tightly controlled and prohibitively expensive. Many Cubans use ""the Package"" - a digest of digital content distributed on USB sticks.
Some key dates in Cuba's history:
1492 - Christopher Columbus claims Cuba for Spain.
1511 - Spanish conquest begins under the leadership of Diego de Velazquez.
1526 - Importing of slaves from Africa begins. 
1762 - Havana captured by a British force. It is returned to Spain a year later. 
1868-78 - Ten Years War of independence ends in a truce with Spain promising reforms and greater autonomy - promises that were mostly never met. 
1886 - Slavery abolished. 
1895-98 - Jose Marti leads a second war of independence; US declares war on Spain. 
1898 - Cuba is ceded to the US after US victory in the Spanish-American War. 
1902 - Cuba becomes independent under the protection of the US.
1933 - Sergeant Fulgencio Batista seizes power in a coup.
1953 - Fidel Castro leads an unsuccessful revolt against the Batista regime. 
1956 - Castro lands in eastern Cuba from Mexico and takes to the Sierra Maestra mountains where, aided by Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, he wages a guerrilla war. 
1959 - Fidel Castro leads a guerrilla army into Havana, forcing Batista to flee. 
1961 - US breaks off diplomatic relations in response to the nationalization of US-owned properties, and later imposes a complete commercial embargo.
The US sponsors an abortive invasion by Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs; Castro proclaims Cuba a communist state and begins to ally it with the USSR. 
1962 - Cuban missile crisis. Fearing a US invasion, Castro allows the USSR to deploy nuclear missiles on the island. The crisis is subsequently resolved when the USSR agrees to remove them in return for the withdrawal of US nuclear missiles from Turkey. 
1975 - Castro sends troops to Angola to help fight rebels backed by South Africa. It is the start of 15 years of war in which 300,000 Cubans will fight.
1975-81 - Cuba sends troops to help Angola's left-wing MPLA fight opposing South African, Unita and FNLA forces. Later Cuban troops help the Ethiopian regime against the Eritreans and Somalis. 
1988 - Cuba agrees to withdraw its troops from Angola following an agreement with South Africa. 
1991 - The Soviet Union, Cuba's biggest benefactor, collapses, triggering an economic crisis.
1994 - Cuba signs an agreement with the US under which the US agrees to admit 20,000 Cubans a year in return for Cuba halting an exodus of refugees.
2002 - Prisoners taken during US-led action in Afghanistan are flown into the US base at Guantanamo Bay for interrogation as al-Qaeda suspects. 
Russia's last military base in Cuba closes.

Uganda's anti-LGBT laws: Man faces death penalty for 'aggravated homosexuality',"A man in Uganda faces the death penalty after being charged with ""aggravated homosexuality"".
His lawyer told Reuters the 20-year-old was the first to be prosecuted for the offence under tough new anti-LGBTQ legislation signed into law in May.
According to the charge sheet, he is accused of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 41-year-old man, although no further details were given.
""Aggravated homosexuality"" can involve sex with children or vulnerable people.
It can also be deemed aggravated if someone is forced to have same-sex relations, contracts a life-long infection including HIV or in cases of serial offenders.
The East African nation has among the harshest anti-LGBTQ laws in the world, and anyone convicted of engaging in homosexual acts faces life imprisonment. 
The legislation has drawn widespread criticism outside the country and prompted the World Bank to halt loans to Uganda earlier this month.
Several people have been arrested this month for allegedly engaging in same-sex activity.
The man charged with aggravated homosexuality appeared in court on 18 August in the eastern city of Soroti, Jacquelyn Okui, spokesperson for the state prosecutors, told the AFP news agency.
She told Reuters he will remain in custody until his case is heard by the High Court, given it was a capital offence.
His lawyer, Justine Balya, told Reuters she felt Uganda's anti-gay laws were unconstitutional and were currently being challenged in court. 
She gave no further details of the case, except to say it was the first aggravated homosexuality charge before the courts.
Uganda has not carried out an execution since 2005, but capital punishment has not been abolished.

Nagorno-Karabakh profile,"The landlocked mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh is the subject of an unresolved territorial dispute between Azerbaijan, in which it lies, and its ethnic Armenian majority, backed by neighbouring Armenia. 
It is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but much of it is governed by the unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, also known as the Republic of Artsakh.
In 1988, towards the end of Soviet rule, fighting between Azerbaijani troops and Armenian secessionists left the de facto independent state in the hands of ethnic Armenians when a truce was signed in 1994. 
Russian peacekeepers have been deployed since 2020 to monitor a new Moscow-brokered ceasefire, and also to ensure safe passage through the so-called ""Lachin corridor"" - which separates Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia.
While Armenia itself has never officially recognised the region's independence, it has become its main financial and military backer and the breakaway territory functions as a de facto part of Armenia. 
Talks have so far failed to produce a permanent peace agreement. Russia, France and the US co-chair the OSCE's Minsk Group, which had been attempting to end the dispute but this has been thrown into doubt by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, The EU is also seeking to aid a peaceful resolution of the issue. 
The authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh operate radio and TV services. Locals can also receive broadcasts from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia: 
Key dates in the history of Nagorno-Karabakh:
The conflict has roots dating back well over a century into competition between Christian Armenian and Muslim Turkic and Persian influences. 
19th Century - Populated for centuries by Christian Armenian and Turkic Azeris, Karabakh becomes part of the Russian empire.
early 20th Century - Acts of brutality on both sides punctuate the region's relative peace, and live on in the popular memory. 
1920s - After the end of World War One and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, the new Soviet rulers, as part of their divide-and-rule policy in the region, established the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region, with an ethnic Armenian majority, within the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan. 
1991 - With the break-up of the Soviet Union, Karabakh declares itself an independent republic, and as Soviet control loosens Armenian-Azeri frictions escalate into a full-scale war. 
1992-94 - First Karabakh war: During the fighting up to 30,000 people are estimated to have lost their lives. Armenians gain control of the region and push on to occupy Azerbaijani territory outside Karabakh, creating a buffer zone around Lachin, linking Karabakh and Armenia. 
More than one million people flee their homes during the fighting. The ethnic Azeri population - about 25% of the total before the war - leaves  Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia while ethnic Armenians flee the rest of Azerbaijan. 
1994 - Russian-brokered ceasefire is signed leaving Karabakh as well as swathes of Azeri territory around the territory in Armenian hands.
1994-2020 - A simmering stalemate prevails punctuated by armed clashes.
2017 - In a referendum, voters approve a new constitution turning the government from a semi-presidential to a fully presidential one. The territory changes its name from Nagorno Karabakh Republic to Republic of Artsakh, though both remain official names.
Karabakh is the Russian rendering of an Azeri word meaning ""black garden"", while Nagorno is a Russian root meaning ""mountainous"". Artsakh is an ancient Armenian name for the area. 
2020 - Second Karabakh war: Azerbaijan launches an offensive that recaptures territory around Karabakh. Some 3,000 Azerbaijani soldiers and 4,000 Armenian soldiers are killed in six weeks of fighting.
Russian peacekeepers are deployed to monitor a new Moscow-brokered ceasefire, and also to ensure safe passage through the so-called ""Lachin corridor"" - which separates Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia.
Armenian forces agreed to return to Azerbaijan all occupied territory outside of the former Soviet Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast.
2022 - Fighting breaks out between Armenian and Azerbaijani troops along the Armenia-Azerbaijan, with about 100 Armenian and 70 Azerbaijani soldiers killed in the clashes.
2022-23 - Armenia claims an Azerbaijani blockade on the Lachin corridor has led to a humanitarian crisis inside the territory. Baku insists the Lachin road should be open for civilians, whereas cargo deliveries should go via the Agdam-Xankandi/Stepanakert road.

Imran Khan: Pakistan court suspends former PM's corruption sentence,"Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has had his three-year sentence for corruption suspended, but it is unclear if he will be freed from jail.
The Islamabad High Court gave him bail until his appeal over the conviction is heard. 
However, another court has also ordered the 70-year-old to be kept in custody until Wednesday in a separate case.
Mr Khan's lawyers say more than 100 charges have been brought against him since his removal from power last year.
These include leaking state secrets and organising violent protests. Various arrest warrants have been issued in relation to these charges.
Mr Khan says all the charges against him are politically motivated. 
The former prime minister's lawyers are seeking a Supreme Court order to prevent him from being detained in any other case, but no date has been set to hear this petition. 
They said the Supreme Court was waiting to hear Tuesday's outcome in the High Court before they set one.  
""We are very hopeful he will be released,"" said one of his lawyers, Gauhar Khan.
""So far we have not been informed that he is arrested under any other case.""
The international cricket star-turned-politician was sentenced to three years in jail on 5 August for not declaring money earned from selling gifts he received during his time in office from 2018-2022.
The gifts - reported to be worth more than 140m Pakistani rupees ($635,000; £500,000) - included Rolex watches, a ring and a pair of cuff links.
As a result of that conviction, he was barred from contesting an election for five years. 
The so-called ""cipher case"" that Mr Khan is now being kept in jail for relates to the alleged leaking of a diplomatic cable.
In the appeal which has led to the suspension of his sentence, Mr Khan's lawyers argue that he was convicted without being able to defend himself. 
The news comes a day after another high court dismissed sedition charges against him, saying they had been improperly filed. 
Authorities deny any political motivation in Mr Khan's arrest or disqualification from running for public office. 
They have repeatedly accused the judges who gave Imran Khan relief of being politically motivated. 
Mr Khan is currently being held in Attock jail, a small facility in Punjab province with historical ties to the military, about 85km (52 miles) from the capital Islamabad. 
According to local media, a number of members of Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party have previously been held there.
Prior to his sentencing, he had managed to avoid arrest for months, with his supporters at times fighting pitched battles with police to keep him out of custody.
On 9 May, Mr Khan was arrested for not appearing at court as requested. He was released three days later, with the arrest ruled illegal.
But the arrest sparked protests across Pakistan - some of them violent and many targeting installations belonging to the military who demonstrators blamed for his downfall. Several thousand of his supporters were alleged to have been involved in the protests and were arrested.
Since then, Mr Khan and the PTI have faced a crackdown, with many of his senior leadership arrested, before announcing they were leaving the party. Many vocal supporters of Mr Khan now feel nervous to express their opinion or even have quietly deleted their previous comments.
Some of those arrested in the protests supporting Mr Khan will face trial in military courts for alleged violence, despite an outcry from human rights groups.
Mr Khan has previously said the army in Pakistan was ""petrified"" of elections which his party would win ""hands down"" and, for that reason, ""they're dismantling a democracy"".
The army plays a prominent role in Pakistan's politics, sometimes seizing power in military coups and, on other occasions, pulling levers behind the scenes.
Many analysts believe Mr Khan's election win in 2018 happened with the help of the military.
In opposition, he has been one of its most vocal critics, and analysts say the army's popularity has fallen.
Pakistan's parliament was dissolved on 9 August, leaving a caretaker government to take over in the run-up to general elections due this year, but likely to be delayed.
It is unclear if they will take place by early November, as required in the constitution.

Live worm found in Australian woman's brain in world first,"This video can not be played
Watch: Australian surgeon Dr Hari Priya Bandi describes her shock at finding the live worm in patient's brain
In a world first, scientists say an 8cm (3in) worm has been found alive in the brain of an Australian woman. 
The ""string-like structure"" was pulled from the patient's damaged frontal lobe during surgery in Canberra last year. 
""It was definitely not what we were expecting. Everyone was shocked,"" said operating surgeon Dr Hari Priya Bandi.
The woman, 64, had for months suffered symptoms like stomach pain, a cough and night sweats, which evolved into forgetfulness and depression.  
She was admitted to hospital in late January 2021, and a scan later revealed ""an atypical lesion within the right frontal lobe of the brain"".
But the cause of her condition was only revealed by Dr Bandi's knife during a biopsy in June 2022.
The red parasite could have been alive in her brain for up to two months, doctors said.
The woman, who lived near a lake area in south-eastern New South Wales state, is recovering well. 
Her case is believed to be the first instance of a larvae invasion and development in the human brain, researchers said in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal which reported the case.
The neurosurgeon who found the worm said she had only begun to touch the brain part that had shown up strangely in the scans when she felt it.
""I thought, gosh, that feels funny, you couldn't see anything more abnormal,"" said Dr Bandi.
""And then I was able to really feel something, and I took my tweezers and I pulled it out and I thought, 'Gosh! What is that? It's moving!""
""Everyone was shocked. And the worm that we found was happily moving, quite vigorously, outside the brain,"" she said.
She then consulted her colleague Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases expert, on what they should do.
""Everyone [in] that operating theatre got the shock of their life when [the surgeon] took some forceps to pick up an abnormality and the abnormality turned out to be a wriggling, live 8cm light red worm,"" said Dr Senanayake.
""Even if you take away the yuck factor, this is a new infection never documented before in a human being.""    
Researchers warn the case highlights the increased danger of diseases and infections being passed from animals to people.  
The Ophidascaris robertsi roundworm is common in carpet pythons - non-venomous snakes found across much of Australia.
Scientists say the woman most likely caught the roundworm after collecting a type of native grass, Warrigal greens, beside a lake near where she lived. The area is also inhabited by carpet pythons.
Writing in the journal, Australian parasitology expert Mehrab Hossain said she suspected the woman became an ""accidental host"" after using the foraged plants - contaminated by python faeces and parasite eggs - for cooking.  
""The invasion of the brain by Ophidascaris larvae had not been reported previously,"" writes Dr Hossain.
""The growth of the third-stage larva in the human host is notable, given that previous experimental studies have not demonstrated larval development in domesticated animals, such as sheep, dogs, and cats.""
Dr Senanayake - who is also an associate professor of medicine at the Australian National University (ANU) - told the BBC the case is a warning.
The ANU team reports that 30 new types of infections have appeared in the last 30 years. Three-quarters are zoonotic - infectious diseases that have jumped from animals to humans.
""It just shows as a human population burgeons, we move closer and encroach on animal habitats. This is an issue we see again and again, whether it's Nipah virus that's gone from wild bats to domestic pigs and then into people, whether it's a coronavirus like Sars or Mers that has jumped from bats into possibly a secondary animal and then into humans.""
""Even though Covid is now slowly petering away, it is really important for epidemiologists… and governments to make sure they've got good infectious diseases surveillance around.""

Algeria country profile,"Algeria, a gateway between Africa and Europe, has been battered by violence over the past half-century.
There are conflicting reports about the death toll during the war against France for independence in the 1950s and early 60s. French historians estimate that up to 400,000 Algerians were killed, while the Algerian government says more than one million people died.
The country later endured a brutal internal conflict after when elections that Islamists appeared certain to win were cancelled in 1992; a low-level Islamist insurgency still affects Algeria.
The Sahara desert covers more than four-fifths of the land. Algeria is the continent's biggest country, and is the world's 10th largest. 
Oil and gas reserves were discovered there in the 1950s, but most Algerians live along the northern coast.  
Abdelmadjid Tebboune won the December 2019 presidential election from a field candidates all associated with the era of Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the long-serving head of state forced out of office by mass protests in April.
The opposition boycotted the election, demanding a clean sweep of the military-dominated elite and a sustained campaign against corruption. 
Mr Tebboune has pledged to carry out the necessary reforms, but the former civil servant faces a serious challenge in winning over public trust.
Press freedom in Algeria has been further restricted following a 2023 law passed by the country's parliament. The measure tightens media ownership rules and empowers courts to force journalists to reveal their sources.
Domestic media outlets will be banned from receiving overseas funding and dual-nationals prevented from owning press or broadcasting companies.
Some key dates in Algeria's history: 
c. 600BC - Carthaginians expand settlements along the North African coast.
4th Century BC - Berbers form the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. 
241-238BC - Revolt of the Mercenaries: Berber soldiers rebel after being unpaid following Carthage's defeat by Rome in the First Punic War. 
146BC - Carthage is destroyed by Roman forces under Scipio Africanus. 
2nd Century BC - Emergence of the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania.
24AD - Berber kingdoms become part of the Roman Empire.
429 - Germanic Vandals invade North Africa and set up kingdom based on Carthage.
477-578 - Rise of the Mauro-Roman kingdom, an independent Christian Berber kingdom centred in Altava.
533-34 - Byzantine forces under Belisarius drive out the Vandals as part of the Emperor Justinian's reconquest of the Western Roman Empire.
578-708 - Kingdom of Altava is a successor state to the previous Berber kingdom. It flourishes until the conquest of the area by the Umayyad Caliphate in the seventh and eighth centuries. 
972-1148 - Zirids: a Berber dynasty from modern-day Algeria rules the central Maghreb from 972 to 1014 and the eastern Maghreb from 972 to 1148.
1050s-1147 - Almoravids: A Berber Muslim dynasty centered in the territory of present-day Morocco established an 11th Century empire  over the western Maghreb (North Africa) and Al-Andalus (southern Spain) starting in the 1050s and lasting until its fall to the Almohads in 1147.
1121-1269 - Almohads: A North African Berber Muslim empire that at its height, controls much of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa.
1235-1557 - Zayyanids: A Berber dynasty centred on the town of Tlemcen in northwest Algeria. 
1509 - Spanish conquer Oran. 
1512 - Turkish privateer brothers Oruç and Hayreddin - both known to contemporary Europeans as Barbarossa or ""Red Beard"" - operate successfully off Tunisia.
1519 - After a Spanish attempt to take Algiers, an assembly of  Algerian notables asks the Ottoman Sultan Selim to make Algiers part of the Ottoman Empire. Hayreddin Barbarossa is named Beylerbey of Algiers, or emir of emirs. The province becomes key for the Turks who see it as the spearhead of Ottoman power in the western Mediterranean.
1681-88 - French-Algerian War: part of a wider campaign by France against the Barbary pirates - mainly Muslim pirates and privateers operating from North Africa to capture slaves for the Ottoman slave trade. In addition to seizing merchant ships, they raided coastal towns and villages in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal but also in the British Isles, Netherlands, and Iceland.
1783-1784 - Following attacks on Spanish merchant shipping, the  Spanish navy and allies bombard Algiers, destroying much of its fortifications.
1815 - The Second Barbary War: between the United States and the   Barbary Coast states of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers.
1816 - Britain and the Netherlands bombard Algiers in a bid to force the local ruler to stop enslaving Europeans. However, this does not completely end until the French conquest of Algeria. 
1830 - French conquest of Algeria. France invades and quickly takes Algiers and seizes other coastal communities. Additional military forces were brought in over the following years to quell resistance in the interior, and to encourage colonists to settle and farm.
1848 - Algeria becomes a department of France, an integral part of France itself. It is a destination for hundreds of thousands of European colonists. Many Europeans settle in Oran and Algiers, and formed a majority of the population in both cities by the early 20th Century - about a fifth of the total population of Algeria.
1939-1945 - The Collapse of France and the Anglo-American occupation of North Africa during World War Two encourages hopes for independence. 
1945 - Pro-independence demonstrations in Setif. Thousands of Algerians are killed in suppression of ensuing unrest.  
1954-1962 - Algerian War of Independence. A major armed conflict between France and the Algerian National Liberation Front  or FLN which sees Algeria winning its independence from France. It is a complex conflict characterized by guerrilla warfare and war crimes. It also becomes a civil war between the different communities and within communities. Death totals vary between 400,000 and 1.5 million. Up to a million European colonists leave Algeria. 
1962 - Algeria becomes independent. 
1976 - Algerian, Moroccan armies clash over Western Sahara.  
1989 - New constitution removes the one-party state and moves country away from socialism to western capitalism.
1991-2002 - Algerian Civil War:  With the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS)dominating the first of two rounds of legislative elections in 1991, and fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities cancel the elections. They ban the FIS, triggering a civil war between Algeria's armed forces and various Islamist rebel groups. Islamist militants conduct a violent campaign of civilian massacres. More than 100,000 people are thought to have died.
1999 - Abdelaziz Bouteflika becomes president and introduces national reconciliation policy. 
2007 onwards - Islamist insurgency campaign in the Maghreb and Sahel by Al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb or AQIM, an Islamist militant organization that aims to overthrow the Algerian government and institute an Islamic state. 
2019 - President Bouteflika announces he will step down after street protests, driven by decade-long economic stagnation, unemployment, labour market segmentation and chronic corruption.

"Peru: Priest of Pacopampa exhumed after 3,000 years","A tomb which had lain undisturbed for 3,000 years has been unearthed during excavations in northern Peru, authorities say.
The occupant of the grave was dubbed the Priest of Pacopampa by archaeologists after the highland area where it was found.
Researchers dug through six layers of ash mixed with black earth to reach his skeleton, which was accompanied by two seals and other sacred offerings.
They described the find as important.
The seals indicated the presence of ancient ritual body paint used for people of elite status, Peru's culture ministry said in a statement.
Project leader Yuji Seki told Reuters news agency that the large size of the tomb, nearly 2m (2.2 yards) in diameter and 1m deep, was ""very peculiar,"" as was the position of the body lying face down with one half of his body extended and feet crossed.
""I think this was a leader in his time,"" he added.
""The find is extremely important because he is one of the first priests to begin to control the temples in the country's northern Andes,"" Mr Seki told AFP news agency.
The Pacopampa site, 2,500m above sea level, includes nine monumental ceremonial buildings of carved and polished stone.
They are estimated to date from about 700 to 600 years BC.
The excavation is a joint endeavour involving archaeologists from the National Museum of Ethnology in Japan and from Peru's National University of San Marcos.

Eminem tells Republican Vivek Ramaswamy to stop rapping his songs,"Rap star Eminem has asked aspiring Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to stop using his songs. 
The letter comes more than a week after the biotech entrepreneur delivered an impromptu performance of Lose Yourself at the Iowa State Fair.
Eminem made the request via performing rights organisation BMI in a letter dated 23 August.
Mr Ramaswamy is vying to unseat Donald Trump as the presumed 2024 Republican nominee. 
A spokeswoman for Mr Ramaswamy said he will comply with the request by Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III. 
The letter says the company ""received a communication from"" Eminem objecting to the Republican's use of his ""musical compositions"".
""BMI will consider any performance of the Eminem works by the Vivek 2024 campaign from this date forward to be a material breach"" of its licence, it adds. 
This video can not be played
Ramaswamy: 'I was clearly the winner of this thing'
Referring to an Eminem lyric, campaign spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to US media: ""Vivek just got on the stage and cut loose.""
""To the American people's chagrin, we will have to leave the rapping to the real slim shady.""
Mr Ramaswamy posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, to make light of the situation. 
""Will The REAL Slim Shady Please Stand Up? He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"" he wrote, referring to more of Eminem's lyrics.
Politicians and musicians have clashed over the use of music for decades. 
Bruce Springsteen castigated President Reagan for planning to use Born in the USA for his 1984 election campaign. Fatboy Slim furiously denounced Labour's use of Right Here, Right Now at their 2004 conference, the year after the Iraq War. And the Rolling Stones fought a long battle to prevent Donald Trump using You Can't Always Get What You Want as his walk-off music.
Legally, however, US politicians don't always need direct permission from artists. Their campaigns can buy licensing packages from music rights organisations like BMI and ASCAP, which gives them legal access to more than 20 million songs for political rallies.
However, artists have the right to remove their music from that list. The Rolling Stones have done so, and Eminem has followed suit after objecting to Mr Ramaswamy's apparently impromptu rendition of Lose Yourself.
It seems that the rapper didn't know his music was covered by the blanket licence until then - an apparent problem with the US model, which resulted in artists like Adele, Neil Young, Phil Collins and the estates of Tom Petty and Prince objecting to Mr Trump's use of their music in 2016 and 2020 after the fact.
In the UK, the situation is clearer. PPL - the body that licences the use of recorded music - requires political events like party conferences to ""obtain permission from the relevant rights holder"" before using a song.
The 38-year-old political newcomer is seen as a rising star in the campaign following a strong performance at last week's Republican debate. 
He has positioned himself as an outsider willing to develop former President Trump's ""America First"" agenda.
Politicians being sent cease and desist letters over their campaign song choices has become something of a tradition in American politics. 
Mr Trump received dozens of letters from record stars - including the Rolling Stones, Queen, Adele and Pharrell Williams - informing him he lacked permission to use their music at campaign and presidential events. 
In 2008, the Foo Fighters spoke out against Republican John McCain for using their tune My Hero during his presidential run and Jackson Browne filed suit against the campaign to force it stop using the song Running on Empty.

"What is Russia's Wagner group, and what has happened to its leader?","Russian officials have confirmed that the leader of the Russian mercenary group Wagner died in a plane crash in western Russia on 23 August.
Yevgeny Prigozhin staged a failed mutiny against Russia's military leaders in June, and had gone to Belarus afterwards with hundreds of Wagner fighters.
The group's future is now very uncertain.
Prigozhin said he founded Wagner in 2014. 
Although mercenary forces are illegal in Russia, Wagner registered as a ""private military company"" in 2022. 
Prigozhin was a wealthy businessman and convicted criminal, known as ""Putin's chef"" because he provided catering for the Kremlin.  
Wagner's first field commander was Dmitry Utkin, a former officer in Russia's special forces. He said the group was named after his radio call sign. 
Most Wagner mercenaries initially came from Russia's elite regiments and special forces, and the group was thought to number about 5,000.
However, in 2022, Prigozhin recruited prisoners from Russian jails to fight for Wagner in Ukraine, in exchange for pardons. In June, he said there were 25,000 Wagner fighters.
The group has also been operating in Syria, Mali, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Libya.
Russian aviation officials said Yevgeny Prigozhin and nine other passengers died when a private plane flying between Moscow and St Petersburg crashed in the Tver region, north of Moscow on 23 August.
Dmitry Utkin was also on board. 
The Investigative Committee said the identities of all 10 victims had been established, after genetic analysis of the bodies, and that it was conducting a criminal investigation into the crash.
UK defence sources have told the BBC that Russia's FSB intelligence agency is most likely to have been responsible.
Wagner troops were heavily involved in the battle for Bakhmut, a city in eastern Ukraine, which they captured for Russia in May 2023.
During the fighting, Prigozhin repeatedly criticised Russia's army chief, Valery Gerasimov, and defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, for under-supplying Wagner's troops, many of whom were killed or injured.
In June 2023, some 5,000 Wagner fighters staged a mutiny. They occupied the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and marched on Moscow, with the stated aim of ousting Gerasimov and Shoigu.
Prigozhin halted the advance after making a deal with Russian President Putin, which was negotiated by the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.
Putin said Wagner's fighters could either join the regular Russian army or go to Belarus with Prigozhin. 
In July, a US military spokesman said Wagner troops were no longer thought to be ""taking part in hostilities"" in Ukraine.

Russian Mercenaries: Inside the Wagner Group
The Polish government has been reported as saying it believes there are between 3,500 and 5,000 Wagner mercenaries in Belarus.
They are thought to be based at military camps in the south of the country, at Tsel and Brestsky. 
The Belarusian defence ministry says they are training the country's territorial forces.
In a speech to Wagner mercenaries in Belarus in July, Prigozhin said the group would ""set off on a new path - to Africa.""
An estimated 1,000 Wagner fighters have been in Mali, in western Africa, since December 2021.
They were hired to combat armed Islamist groups, replacing the UN and French peacekeeping forces which had previously operated there. 
Wagner forces have clashed several times with a group linked to al-Qaeda called Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin.
In a recent video recording, apparently filmed in Africa, Prigozhin said: ""We're making life a nightmare for ISIS [Islamic State] and al-Qaeda and other bandits.""
There are an estimated 1,000 Wagner fighters in the Central African Republic (CAR). 
The UK government says they operate behind a front organisation called the Officers Union for International Security.
That group's leader has said it is training soldiers in CAR to fight rebel forces, and has been helping to protect supply lines to cities. 
A Wagner company called Midas allegedly makes money from gold mining in the country.
Video evidence suggests Wagner has been in Sudan since 2017, providing military training and helping to crack down on protestors.
In 2017, Sudan's government awarded gold mining contracts to Prigozhin's company, M-Invest. In July 2020, the US imposed sanctions against the company and its subsidiary Meroe Gold.
In Libya, Wagner troops are supporting the forces of General Khalifa Haftar.
Wagner's mercenaries have also been in Syria since 2015, supporting pro-government forces and guarding oilfields.
The US Treasury says Wagner companies have made profits from oil and gas deals there.
Ukrainian prosecutors say three Wagner mercenaries killed and tortured civilians near Kyiv in April 2022, alongside regular Russian troops.
German intelligence says Wagner troops may also have massacred civilians in Bucha in March 2022.
In 2020, the US military accused Wagner mercenaries of planting landmines and similar devices in and around the Libyan capital, Tripoli. 
In July 2023, the UK sanctioned Wagner's businesses in Africa, accusing it of ""executions and torture in Mali and the Central African Republic and threats to peace and security in Sudan"".

Sara Sharif: Pakistan police widen search for family,"Pakistan police said they are widening the search for the family of a 10-year-old girl found dead at her Surrey home.
Detectives launched an international manhunt after Sara Sharif's body was discovered by police at an address in Hammond Road, Woking, on 10 August.
Her father Urfan, his partner and his brother, had travelled to Pakistan the previous day.
An inquest into Sara's death is due to open at Woking Coroner's Court on Tuesday.
Pakistan police told the BBC they had expanded the search to two more areas around the city of Jhelum - taking the total to four areas, having received new information from multiple sources.
A post-mortem examination failed to establish an exact cause of death, with Surrey Police saying further tests were being carried out.
The three people who are wanted by the police are Sara's father, Urfan Sharif, 41, his partner, Beinash Batool, 29, and his brother, Faisal Malik, 28.
Officers said Mr Sharif, 41, made the 999 call from Pakistan leading to them finding Sara's body, shortly after landing in Islamabad.
A court in Pakistan last week has said Mr Sharif's relatives in the country cannot be detained for questioning on his whereabouts. 
It came after Mr Sharif's family said police had illegally detained two of his brothers who live in Pakistan.
Surrey Police recently launched a fresh appeal for information, and said they were working to piece together a picture of Sara's lifestyle.
Det Supt Mark Chapman said the impact of Sara's death continued to be felt deeply by the local and wider community, including among officers and staff.
Sara's head teachers and neighbours have paid tribute to the Year 5 pupil who had attended St Mary's C of E primary school in Byfleet.
However, those who knew Sara have described how she had been home-schooled since April.
One mother has revealed her daughter saw Sara with cuts and bruises at school but when her daughter asked Sara what had happened, she said she had fallen off her bike.
It emerged last week that Surrey Police had previous contact with Sara, which the force described as ""historic"".
Surrey County Council also said the family were known to the authorities.

Chevron: Workers at major Australia gas facilities to strike,"Workers at two large liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants in Australia are set to go on strike from 7 September, in a move that could drive up global prices.
It follows weeks of negotiations with unions over pay and working conditions.
Chevron, the US energy giant which operates the sites, said it would ""continue to take steps to maintain safe and reliable operations in the event of disruption at our facilities"".
Fears of strikes recently pushed up wholesale gas prices in Europe.
The Wheatstone and Gorgon sites produce more than 5% of the world's LNG and about 500 workers are currently employed at the two plants in Western Australia.
The industrial action will see workers down tools for up to 11 hours a day, according to a strike plan seen by the BBC.
""While we don't believe that industrial action is necessary for agreement to be reached, we recognise employees have the right to take protected industrial action,"" Chevron said in a statement on Tuesday.
It added that it would ""continue to work through the bargaining process as we seek outcomes that are in the interests of both employees and the company.""
The Offshore Alliance - which is a partnership of two unions representing energy workers, including those at Chevron - said it had been trying to reach an agreement with the company on ""several key"" issues including pay, job security, rosters and training standards.
It added that workers had been ""consistently disappointed with the company's approach to negotiations with the union and Chevron not accepting that an industry standard agreement should apply to the work they perform for the company"".
Energy analyst Saul Kavonic said he currently expects the strike to have a limited impact on global gas prices. 
However, he warned that energy prices could surge if the industrial action was stepped up.
""In the very unlikely event of a prolonged large scale supply disruption, prices could head back towards crisis levels witnessed last year,"" he added.
Samantha Dart, senior energy analyst at Goldman Sachs, recently told the BBC: ""The problem is these facilities in Australia that produce liquefied natural gas, they are supplying the whole of Asia. 
""When Asia doesn't have enough of it, they come and buy from the Atlantic Basin so LNG that would otherwise just be delivered to Europe go to Asia because of that higher competition for supply.""
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year sent oil and gas prices soaring, leading to a sharp rise in energy bills for homes and businesses. 
Last week, wholesale gas prices in Europe jumped on concerns of a disruption to supply at Chevron and another Australian LNG plant, run by Woodside Energy.
On Thursday, Woodside said it had reached an agreement in principle with unions representing workers at its North West Shelf plant.
Together, the Woodside and Chevron plants make up around 10% of the world's supply of LNG.
Russia slashed supplies of natural gas to Europe after the start of the Ukraine war in 2022.
That pushed up prices around the world and led countries to seek out alternative sources of energy, such as LNG.
Australia is one of the world's biggest LNG exporters and its supplies have helped to cool global energy prices.
LNG is methane, or methane mixed with ethane, cleansed of impurities and cooled to approximately -160C. 
This turns the gas into a liquid and it can then be shipped in pressurised tankers.
At its destination, LNG is turned back into gas and used, like any other natural gas, for heating, cooking and power.

Toyota halts all Japan assembly plants due to glitch,"Japanese motor industry giant Toyota has suspended operations at all of its assembly plants in its home country due to a glitch in its production system.
The move has brought domestic production at the world's biggest-selling car maker to a standstill.
The malfunction has meant the firm has not been able to order components.
A spokesperson told the BBC that the firm is trying to find the cause of the problem but does not currently believe it is due to a cyber attack.
On Tuesday morning, Toyota suspended operations at 12 of its 14 assembly plants in Japan.
Later in the day a spokesperson said production at all 14 facilities would be suspended.
The company has not yet said when it plans to restart the operations or how much production is expected to be lost due to the stoppage.
In total, the 14 plants are estimated to account for around a third of Toyota's global production.
The suspension comes as Toyota's production in Japan had been recovering after a series of issues.
Its operations were hit last year after one of its suppliers was affected by a cyber attack.
The one-day disruption caused an output loss of around 13,000 cars.
Also last year, Toyota suspended operations at some of its production lines in Japan due to the coronavirus lockdown in China's economic hub Shanghai.
""Due to the impact of the semiconductor shortage, we announced our revised production plan for May,"" Toyota said at the time.
Toyota is a pioneer of the so-called ""just-in-time"" production system, which keeps costs down but can be vulnerable to problems if deliveries of components are disrupted.

Thammakaset: Thai poultry farmer loses his 36th defamation suit,"Three Thai human rights campaigners have been found not guilty of criminal defamation over social media posts. 
Poultry businessman Chanchai Pheamphon accused the women of posting comments in support of others he had sued. 
The comments were about the alleged abuse of migrant workers at his chicken processing factories. 
Mr Chanchai has lost all but one of the 37 cases he has filed, a record for Thailand where plaintiffs can sue for defamation quite easily. 
He had argued that people reading the campaigners' posts might be encouraged to go to a 107-second video, made by a human rights group, which he believed had defamed him. 
On Tuesday in court, the judge reached his verdict in less than 10 minutes. To find that video people would have to click on several links, he said. He concluded there were no grounds for convicting the defendants.
""I can't say I am happy with the verdict because I don't think I did anything wrong from the beginning, and the plaintiff shouldn't even sue me,"" said one of the defendants, Angkhana Neelapaijit, after leaving the court. 
A member of Thailand's National Human Rights Commission, she faced a jail term for up to eight years. She was cleared along with Puttanee Kangkun and Thanaporn Saleelphol. 
It took the court nearly four years since the defamation complaint was filed to reach what looks like an almost inevitable verdict. For the defendants it has been a stressful and costly ordeal. Ms Angkhana has been campaigning against injustices since her husband, Somchai, a human rights lawyer, was abducted and disappeared 19 years ago. She has been appointed to the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.
Thailand's punitive defamation laws have long been criticised for stifling free speech. They have been described by some as a legal blood-sport, used by politicians and businesspeople, in particular against journalists and activists who publish anything negative about them. 
""We've wasted four years,"" Ms Angkhana said. ""We've spent so much money on hiring lawyers or travelling costs. It's been such a trauma, it affects my mental [health] and my work. This is something that cannot be measured.
Many countries make defamation - publishing comments judged to damage a person or organisation's reputation - a criminal offence. But in very few is it used, and abused, as liberally as in Thailand. The human rights group Article 19 says Thai statistics show that 25,000 criminal defamation cases have been filed with the courts since 2015, in what the UN says amounts to judicial harassment.
Under Thai law truth is not a defence in defamation cases. Even if what the defendant has said is demonstrably true, even if the plaintiff admits it is true, the defendant can still be found guilty, unless they can show there is a public interest in publishing.
Plaintiffs do not have to convince the police or a prosecutor to take up the case - they can take their complaint directly to court, at very little cost, and Thai judges almost always take them to trial, regardless of their merits. Defendants must then take on the considerable costs of getting legal representation in cases that might last several years, and these costs are not reimbursed even if they win their case.
This particular case began in 2016 when 14 migrant workers in the Thammakaset chicken processing plant complained that they had been made to work excessively long hours and had their passports withheld. The Thai authorities upheld their complaint and ordered the company to pay the workers 1.7 million baht ($50,000) in compensation. But Mr Chanchai then started filing criminal charges - 37 of them, against 22 individuals, who had commented about the case.
""The cases filed by companies, such as Thammakaset Company Limited, are a clear example of businesses abusing the legal system in order to censor, intimidate, and silence criticism,"" says the UN Human Rights Council. ""We are deeply concerned that human rights defenders are facing prison sentences and heavy fines for exercising their right to freedom of expression.""
For his part Mr Chanchai says he is only exercising his right to defend his company's reputation with his epic litigation. He has lost every case but one, and that one case was overturned on appeal.
In a strikingly similar case, a pineapple processing company in southern Thailand filed multiple criminal and civil charges against British labour activist Andy Hall in 2013 over a report he helped research which alleged that the company had mistreated its workers. 
The trials and appeals went back and forth, alternately finding Mr Hall guilty and not guilty, sometimes overturning these verdicts, for seven years, eventually forcing the activist to leave Thailand because he said the endless court appearances were preventing him from working. 
When asked why he kept going, the elderly owner of the pineapple processing company told the BBC he could not stop because he felt he had lost face. 
There have been many appeals made to Thailand by the UN, by human rights groups and by many Western governments, to find a way to curb the number of criminal defamation prosecutions. Quite apart from the damaging impact on people and freedom of expression, these thousands of cases clog up the Thai courts and slow down an already sluggish judicial system even further.
In 2018 the Thai criminal procedure code was amended to allow judges to dismiss similar cases filed repeatedly by the same plaintiff, or which are filed in bad faith. The 37 Thammasaket cases would appear to meet that criteria. The lawyer representing the three women had asked the judge to dismiss their case on these grounds, but he refused. The International Commission of Jurists says it is not aware of any case in which this amendment has been invoked to reject a criminal defamation complaint. 
Strict laws against criticising the judiciary deter legal experts from explaining publicly why this is the case. But privately some have told the BBC that Thai judges are often young - you can be a judge at 25 years old - inexperienced, and trained in too literal an interpretation of the law to have the confidence to dismiss even transparently opportunistic criminal complaints. 
They also said a Thai cultural norm, which places a higher value on protecting reputations than on freedom of expression, may play a role here.
""I am more careful about what I post online now. My social media is normally set to private, and even where I comment publicly, I am very careful about what I say. At some level I feel I am self-censoring,"" says Sutharee Wannasiri, another human rights campaigner, who won the case filed against her by Thammakaset in 2020.
She won again last year when the company appealed against that verdict. But as Thammakaset has taken the case to the Supreme Court, it could take another year before she can finally be free of all legal proceedings. 
""It is really frustrating,"" Ms Sutharee says. ""It feels like an obstruction of our work, our fundamental right to communicate human rights issues without fear of retaliation.""

G20: Putin tells India PM Modi he will not attend Delhi summit,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he will not attend the G20 Summit in Delhi next month. 
India is hosting this year's summit, which will be held in the capital Delhi from 9-10 September.
Mr Putin rang Mr Modi and told him that Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would attend the summit on his behalf.
The two leaders also discussed several ""regional and global issues of mutual concern"", India said in a statement.
A Russian government spokesperson had said last week that Mr Putin would not attend the summit as he had a ""busy schedule"".
The G20 includes the world's 19 wealthiest countries plus the European Union. India currently holds the G20 presidency, which rotates annually between members.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine is expected to be a talking point at the summit in Delhi, where world leaders including US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will be present.
Last week, Mr Putin attended the Brics summit - Brics is an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - held in Johannesburg by video link to avoid the risk of possible arrest by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC has issued a warrant for Mr Putin's arrest, accusing him of war crimes in Ukraine.
In its statement on Monday, India said that Mr Modi expressed ""an understanding for Russia's decision"" and thanked Mr Putin for supporting Delhi's initiatives while it held the G20 presidency. 
Russia's statement did not mention Mr Putin's absence at the G20 summit but said that the two countries had agreed to ""closely collaborate in the context of Russia's BRICS chairmanship"", which starts on 1 January next year.
""The discussion also touched on current issues of Russian-Indian relations, which are developing progressively in the spirit of a specially privileged strategic partnership,"" it added.

'Dying by the dozens every day' - Ukraine losses climb,"There has been a dramatic rise in Ukraine's number of dead, according to new estimates by unnamed US officials. The BBC's Quentin Sommerville has been on the front line in the east, where the grim task of counting the dead has become a daily reality.
The unknown soldiers lie piled high in a small brick mortuary, not very far from the front line in Donetsk, where 26-year-old Margo says she speaks to the dead. 
""It may sound weird… but I'm the one who wants to apologise for their deaths. I want to thank them somehow. It's as if they can hear, but they can't respond.""
At her cluttered desk outside the mortuary's heavy door, she sits, pen in hand. It is her job to record the particulars of the fallen. 
Ukraine gives no official toll of its war dead - the Ukrainian armed forces have reiterated that their war casualty numbers are a state secret - but Margo knows the losses are huge.  
The figures remain classified. But US officials, quoted by the New York Times, recently put the number at 70,000 dead and as many as 120,000 injured. It is a staggering figure, from an armed forces estimated at only half a million strong. The UN has recorded 9,177 civilian deaths to date.
On Margo's inside right arm is a small tattoo of a mother and child, with the birthdate of her son recorded. Her manicured nails are painted in Ukrainian colours. She wears a black T-shirt with the words ""I'M UKRAINIAN"" on the front. 
""The hardest is when you see a dead young guy who hasn't even reached 20, 22 years old. And realising they didn't die their own death,"" she says. ""They were killed. They were killed for their own land. That's the most painful. You cannot get used to this. It's now getting to the point where it's just about [helping] the boys reach home.""
The most difficult day of her life, she says, was when her common-law husband was brought into the mortuary on the day he died. Twenty-three-year-old Andrii was killed in battle on 29 December 2022.
""He died while defending his motherland,"" she says. ""But then, for the umpteenth time, I've convinced myself that I should be here, I should be helping the fallen."" 
The job has made her hard - like steel, she says. And no matter how painful it is to see the bodies being brought into the mortuary, she says she never cries in public.
""I keep all of this inside me [until] the evening when I come home. No-one sees my tears.""
As recently as April, leaked estimates from the Pentagon put Ukrainian deaths at the much lower figure of 17,500. The alleged jump to more than 70,000 can be partly explained by the counter-offensive in the south. In its early days it was especially hard on Ukrainian infantry - ""worse than Bakhmut"" one brigade commander who is fighting there told me. The city in Donetsk fell to Russia in May in one of the bloodiest battles of the war so far. 
Ukraine has now changed tactics there, but the beginning of the push to breach Russia's occupation defences in June was costly, for young newly trained soldiers in particular. They were dying ""by the dozens"" every day, one senior sergeant fighting around the Donetsk village of Velyka Novosilka told me in June.
At the mortuary, one of a number along the front line, they work to put names to the unknown soldiers, who come direct from the battlefield. 
Body bags are brought outside, one at a time, and the search for clues begins. Inside the first body bag is the corpse of a young man, his eyes still open, his hands folded carefully across his lap. His face is cut, and there is a gash on the side of his leg. Another body is brought out, the fingers missing on the right hand, blood and battlefield mud stain his uniform.
Their pockets are cut open by mortuary staff, still full of the artefacts of everyday life - keys, a mobile phone, a wallet with family snaps. In death, these items are now clues that might reunite the unidentified with their families. 
Written in black marker pen on another body bag, the word ""Unidentified"" is scored out and replaced with a man's name and army company details.  
More body bags emerge, but reporting restrictions don't allow me to say how many. 
A group of soldiers - commanders of various ranks - arrive in an army pick-up truck and pace outside the mortuary, smoking cigarettes. They inspect one body, to see if the soldier is from their platoon, company or battalion. It looks like he was killed in an artillery strike - part of his head is missing and the wounds to his body are severe, even worse when he is turned over. 
""This is difficult. Unpleasant. But it's needed, part of our job. We have to give the boys a proper send-off,"" says a deputy battalion commander who goes by the call sign ""Avocat"".
More men from his unit will be brought to aid in the identification of the body, he says. 
The reality of the scale of casualties is laid bare in Ukraine's cemeteries.
In the late afternoon sun around Krasnopilske cemetery in Dnipro, the heads of the sunflowers hang heavy - an honour-guard for the freshly dug graves that spread ever closer to the perimeter. 
At one such graveside, 31-year-old Oksana weeps alone. Pictures of her dead husband Pavlo gaze down on her. The bearded and brawny junior sergeant was a power-lifting champion and personal trainer. He was killed during Ukraine's previous counter-offensive, near the city of Izium in November when a missile from a Russian helicopter struck his convoy.  
""He voluntarily went to defend our country,"" Oksana says. ""He was a warrior at heart - freedom loving. He was the embodiment of our Ukrainian spirit.""
It took time to identify Pavlo's body - he, along with others in the car, was badly burnt. Eventually he was recognised by a tattoo. 
The yellow and blue of Ukrainian flags whip above each grave in the gentle breeze - there are hundreds of them. Each is a marker in the great tide of loss that sweeps daily across eastern and southern battlefields, filling cemeteries in towns and villages the length and breadth of Ukraine. 
A year and a half into this war, few families here have been left untouched by grief.
But still, there appears to be no slackening in the will to fight. If anything, the losses have, for now, galvanised the determination for victory.  
Oksana and Pavlo made a wartime pact that if he died, she would join the military. For the past two months she's been serving as part of an aerial surveillance drone unit, on the outskirts of Bakhmut. 
A week after we met in the cemetery, Oksana is in full body armour and heading to a forward position in search of a Russian anti-tank unit which is targeting Ukrainian forces. When we get there, the sound of artillery, almost entirely outgoing fire, is deafening. 
I ask her why she put herself in harm's way? It is her moral duty, she says, as she plays with the silver wedding ring on her right hand. 
She says: ""I just need to continue what he started. So, all his efforts were not in vain. Volunteering and donations are all good, but I want to be a part of it, a part of our victory in the future.""
Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar earlier released a statement warning that those who release casualty numbers would be liable to criminal prosecution. 
""Why is this data secret?"" she asked rhetorically. ""Because during the active phase of the war, the enemy uses the number of dead and wounded to calculate our likely further actions… If the enemy has this information, they will begin to understand some of our next steps.""
The toll of the war hangs heavy on the men of the 68th Jaeger Brigade, who are fighting to stop Russian advances on the eastern front, near the town of Kupiansk. 
In 35C-plus temperatures, we sought some shelter under camouflage netting, away from the midday heat and the ever-present danger of Russian drones. A deputy battalion commander who goes by the call-sign ""Lermontov"" was in a reflective and dark mood. Over freshly brewed coffee, he predicted a long war. 
The Russians won't stop, he said, ""you can't negotiate with them"". The West doesn't understand this. Young soldiers who expected to be home in a year realise now, he said, they will be gone longer. 
He is a veteran of the fight in Donbas, he's been fighting Russia and its proxies since 2014. How long then did he expect this war to last? ""Another 10 years,"" he replied. 
His grim mood was understandable. On 1 August, the brigade's sergeant major and two other sergeants were killed in a single Russian mortar strike. ""He was a legend,"" Lermontov said. The dead man's car was parked where he had left it, a few feet away. His personal belongings still inside. 
As we spoke, Lermontov's phone buzzed. It was the mother of a soldier killed the week before. She wanted to know why young men with guns were being sent to attack Russian trenches if Ukraine had been gifted so much modern Western weaponry. But on this 600-mile front line many brigades lack the latest armoured vehicles or long-range guns. The reality is that in many of the trenches, Ukrainian soldiers have to make do. ""I don't have an answer for her, she doesn't understand… we don't have everything,"" he told me. 
At a medal ceremony, in the garden of a house which serves as a company base, I meet the brigade's commander, Colonel Oleksii. He had just returned from the sergeant major's funeral. 
He told me: ""We had two big [Russian attacks]. I think we were very successful, we found around 35 bodies. So I think basically we demolished one company.""
Overall Russia's casualties are far greater, some 120,000 dead according to the latest US estimate. But its army, and population, is far larger. Ukrainian soldiers at the front line say Russia's ability to absorb pain appears limitless. 
I ask Colonel Oleksii what he tells the families of the fallen. 
""I just ask for forgiveness that I have not provided enough safety. Maybe I was a bad leader, bad planning. And I thank them for what they gave for this fight.""

Aircraft crash: US marines killed in Australia identified,"Three US marines who were killed in a fiery aircraft crash during a military drill in Australia have been identified.
The MV-22B Osprey came down on a remote island north of Darwin on Sunday.
Captain Eleanor LeBeau, 29, Corporal Spencer Collart, 21, and Major Tobin Lewis, 37, were killed and the 20 other people on board - all US marines - were injured. 
The cause of the crash remains under investigation.
In a statement on Tuesday, the commanding officer of the Marine Rotational Force Darwin said the force was ""deeply saddened"" by the loss of such ""respected and beloved"" marines.
Capt LeBeau - originally from Illinois - was piloting the Osprey and had served in the marines for five years, while Cpl Collart - from Virginia - enlisted in 2020. 
Maj Lewis - from Colorado - was a highly decorated leader with over 15-years' experience in the marines, and was the executive officer on board the aircraft.
""Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families and with all involved,"" Col Brendan Sullivan said, adding that his team remained focused on ongoing recovery and investigative efforts.
The aircraft had been participating in Predators Run, a training exercise involving 2,500 troops from the US, Australia, the Philippines, East Timor and Indonesia, when it crashed on Melville Island. 
Soon after, air traffic control were heard discussing a ""significant fire"" at the site, according to audio obtained by local media.
All 20 marines who survived the crash were taken to hospital. One remains in a critical condition, and another two are in hospital but stable.
The incident is the second fatal air crash during joint exercises in northern Australia in less than a month.
On 29 July four Australian soldiers died after their 45 MRH-90 Taipan crashed off the coast of Queensland while participating in Exercise Talisman Sabre, the largest bilateral military training exercise between Australia and the US.
The latest incident is one of several recent crashes involving an Osprey - a helicopter and turbo-prop plane hybrid.
Four marines were killed in a crash in Norway last year, and three others died in 2017 when their aircraft clipped the back of a transport ship off northern Australia.

Three hanged for Iraq bombing that killed more than 300 people,"Iraq has hanged three people convicted of involvement in a vehicle bombing in Baghdad that killed more than 300 people and injured hundreds in 2016. 
The bomb exploded as people were enjoying a night out during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
It was the deadliest single bombing in Iraq since the US-led invasion in 2003.
The Islamic State group (IS) has admitted carrying out the attack. IS has been defeated and lost control of territory, but still remains active.
The executions were carried out on Sunday or Monday, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani's office said. It did not name those executed. 
A government source told AFP news agency that Ghazwan al-Zawbaee, held to be the IS mastermind behind the attack, was among those put to death. Zawbaee had been captured and returned to Iraq in 2021.
The prime minister informed victims' families that ""the rightful punishment of death sentence"" had been carried out against ""three key criminals found guilty of their involvement in the terrorist bombing"", his office said.
On 3 July 2016 a vehicle filled with explosives was blown up next to a crowded shopping centre in Karrada, a mainly Shia Muslim area of the Iraqi capital.
Many of the victims were killed by a fire that ripped through the building after the bomb blast.
Interior Minister Mohammed Ghabban resigned in the wake of the blast.
The then-Prime Minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, accused Zawbaee of being the ""primary culprit"" behind that attack and ""many others"".
IS, a Sunni Muslim group, once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from eastern Iraq to western Syria and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people.
Despite the group's defeat on the battlefield in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later, it is estimated that thousands of militants remain active in both countries.
In March, the UN estimated that IS still had ""5,000 to 7,000 members and supporters"" across Iraq and neighbouring Syria, ""roughly half of whom are fighters"".

Salif Keïta: 'Golden Voice of Africa' supports Mali's coup leaders,"Shock. Bafflement. Scepticism. These were some of the reactions among a group of music fans when Mali's much-beloved Salif Keïta - known as the Golden Voice of Africa - was appointed as a special adviser to coup leader Col Assimi Goïta.  
 The 73-year-old might be in semi-retirement and eclipsed nowadays by Afrobeats stars, but he was one of the pioneering giants of a generation that put African music on the global map.   
After 50 successful years in the music industry, he remains influential, admired and well-known. 
Keïta mixes traditional Mandé music with jazz, blues and Western music styles and was nominated several times for a Grammy for his infectious melodies and powerful voice. 
He has albinism - and he has campaigned tirelessly against discrimination.   
In 2005, the musician set up the Salif Keïta Global Foundation to raise awareness of the condition and speak out against a perception in some African countries that albinism is an ill omen. 
People with albinism are often shunned and bullied - as Keïta was as a child - and in some countries, like Burundi and Tanzania, they are killed or body parts cut off and used in rituals.  
Keïta's dream as a child was to be a teacher - but he was denied the opportunity and told he ""would scare the children"".
Keïta has raised funds from his concerts and donated proceeds of his record sales to his foundation to help with medical assistance of people with albinism - who are more prone to skin cancer and poor eyesight because of their genetic condition.   
So why would Keïta take on such a role as special adviser on cultural affairs to a man who has led not one but two coups - the first in August 2020 and the second in May 2021?
Three years ago, there was significant popular support for Mali's military junta when it seized power after mass protests against then-President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, who is no relation to the musician. 
People had had enough of feeble leadership, corruption, economic hardship and chronic insecurity caused by an Islamist insurgency. 
The musical mega-star was one of them - Keïta had been very outspoken in his criticism of IBK, as the ousted and late president was known.  
In 2019, a video of Keïta, speaking in the Bambara language and addressing IBK directly, went viral. 
He demanded that the president stand up against the former colonial power, France, which then had troops in Mali fighting the militant Islamists. 
Keïta dismissed France's President Emmanuel Macron as a ""kid"" - and falsely accused France of financing the jihadists. 
He has also expressed doubts about Western-style democracy working in African countries.  
""Democracy is not a good thing for Africa,"" he told the UK's Guardian newspaper in 2019. ""To have a democracy, people have to understand democracy, and how can people understand when 85% of the people in the country cannot read or write?"" 
Keïta suggested that African people needed ""a benevolent dictator"". 
His views are out of step with most Africans - almost 70% of people in 30 African countries say ""democracy is preferable to any other kind of government"", according to a survey published by research group Afrobarometer in May. 
In Mali, however, 82% of people trust the military ""somewhat"" or ""a lot"". 
So Keïta appears to be in tune with the public mood in the West African state by supporting the junta. 
He also served in the interim parliament - the National Transitional Council (NTC) - set up in December 2020 by the coup leaders as part of what they called a transition to civilian rule. 
""This is a decisive time for Mali,"" Keïta told Bloomberg news agency at the time. 
""It's very important that we correct the mistakes that have been made in the past."" 
In what the junta would see as a success, the World Bank said in July that Mali's economy has proved ""resilient"" despite high food inflation, cotton production being affected by a parasite infestation and  sanctions imposed by the West African regional bloc Ecowas imposed to force the coup leaders to give up power. 
But little progress has so far been made in achieving stability, with the monitoring group Acled saying violence in 2022 reached the highest levels it had ever recorded. 
Soldiers dominate the interim parliament, and the presence of the Russian mercenary group Wagner has undermined the junta's claim that it stands for Mali's sovereignty and that it will be more effective than the French troops that have now left and a UN force that is winding down its operations. 
On 31 July, Keïta stepped down from the NTC - he cited ""purely personal reasons"" while reiterating that he would remain an ""unquestionable ally"" of the soldiers, but did not mention Col Goïta.
His decision fuelled speculation in Mali that he was trying to distance himself from the junta, especially as it had just adopted a new constitution that entrenched the military's grip on power. 
But on 11 August Keïta accepted what was in effect a promotion -  the post of special adviser on cultural affairs. 
Col Goïta appeared to have appointed him to the post in an attempt to boost his popularity ahead of elections due to take place by February next year. There is intense speculation that the young and charismatic junta leader will transform himself into a civilian politician,  and run for the presidency. 
Musicians around Africa have often spoken out against military takeovers, oppressive regimes and democrats who turn into autocrats. Often at a great personal cost. 
Zombie was a huge hit in 1978 for Nigeria's Fela Kuti - it is a passionate rallying cry against the brutality of the then military regime, which detained and beat him. 
Angélique Kidjo had to flee Benin in 1983 - because she refused to praise the work of the country's then communist regime. She could not speak to her parents for six years because their phone was tapped. 
But other musicians have aligned themselves with authoritarian rulers. 
In the late 1970s, Mobutu Sese Seko - the-then ruler of Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo - paid the country's biggest star Franco - the Sorcerer of the Guitar - and his TPO OK Jazz band to perform at huge propaganda concerts. 
Franco's ""tightrope tango"" as the New African magazine described his relationship with the authoritarian leader Mobutu ""saw him alternate veiled criticism of the regime with outright paeans"" or praise songs. 
But mostly Franco was a praise-singer - and he became very powerful as a result. Mobutu gave him a nightclub and the country's largest record-pressing factory - Franco proceeded to prioritise his own albums. 
It was Guinea's music-loving first President Ahmed Sekou Touré who in 1958 started the state sponsorship of bands in West Africa. 
Touré was determined to help ensure a modern African music thrived - by paying for musical instruments, equipment and musicians' salaries. Out of that came Bembeya Jazz - one of Guinea's most successful bands.  
Modibo Keïta, Mali's first president, followed suit.  
When he was overthrown in a coup in 1968, the plug was pulled on state sponsorship. 
But the ex-president's brother-in-law, Djibril Diallo, was a huge music fan - and the director of Mali's national railway, which owned a hotel. 
Diallo set up a band at the railway-owned hotel, in effect continuing the state sponsorship. The Rail Band was born in 1970 - from where Salif Keïta launched his career. 
In the 1970s Keïta had to flee the political unrest in Mali for Ivory Coast. 
Touré, still in power in Guinea, was a huge Keïta fan. In 1976 he bestowed a Guinean national honour on him. 
In return, Keïta composed the track Mandjou - a praise song for Touré, even though by that stage he had become a brutal and bloody ruler. Keïta performed rearrangements of Mandjou throughout his musical career. 
Now, as the Golden Voice of Africa takes up his role as special adviser to Col Goïta, the question is: will Keïta be a praise-singer or will he provide the sage and critical counsel that we have come to expect of the relentless anti-discrimination campaigner?

Saudi Arabia's multi-billion dollar football powerhouse bet,"Al Hilal club is Saudi Arabia's most decorated football team having won 66 trophies. They have also won the AFC Champions League a record four times, making the Riyadh-based club the most successful team in Asia.
Despite its impressive history, for many supporters, 19 August 2023 marked the beginning of a new era for the club when Neymar Junior was unveiled in front of more than 65,000 ecstatic fans. 
A volley of fireworks, followed by a drone show projecting Neymar's face, lit up Riyadh's sky as the Brazilian forward walked onto the pitch wearing the club's traditional dark blue kit.
""It is a very special day for us. Neymar is a mega star. He will bring in a lot of fans to Al Hilal. I think the whole of Brazil will support us now. The club will be known everywhere,"" Al Hilal fan Abdullah Almutawa told the BBC, who came to witness the ceremony.
The ambitious project to make Saudi Arabia an international football hub started with the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo at Al Nassr in January on a two-and-a-half-year deal said to be worth over $400m (£318m or 370m euros) in wages. 
This opened the floodgates for a jaw-dropping summer transfer window with the Saudi league snapping up some of the biggest names in the sport. Karim Benzema was the next big signing in June when he moved to Jeddah-based Al Ittihad from Real Madrid. 
Since then, a host of prominent names including Sadio Mane, Riyad Mahrez, Jordan Henderson, N'Golo Kante, have swapped European leagues for the Saudi Pro League.
During the summer, the Saudi Pro League spent more than $900m on transfer fees to acquire foreign players, making it the second-highest spender after the English Premier League. The figure does not include the eye-watering salaries offered to lure players primarily from top European leagues.
And this is not a one-off splash, according to the league's chief operating officer, Carlo Nohra. The Saudi Arabian government has given a commitment to financially back the league until it achieves its goal of becoming one of the top leagues in the world in terms of revenues and quality. 
The Saudi Pro League aims to compete with the likes of the English Premier League, and La Liga. 
Mr Nohra says they will continue spending big to attract foreign players until the league achieves its objective, but it is also simultaneously working towards unlocking the commercial value that's on offer.
""While we have the commitment of getting support until however long it takes to achieve our goals, it is important for us to make ourselves commercially viable so that we are responsible for our own financial growth and not completely dependent on government capital,"" Mr Nohra told the BBC.
The world's biggest oil exporter has invested billions of dollars in sport, including revamping the Saudi Pro league, Formula One and the lucrative LIV Golf. Some critics have described it as ""sportswashing"" to distract people from its poor human rights record.
But some experts believe that managing image and reputation is not the only reason behind Saudi Arabia's strategy. According to Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport and Geopolitical Economy at Skema Business School in Paris, ""nations across the world used sports and entertainment as a policy tool to project soft power"". 
""It's one element of a policy armoury that Saudi Arabia is currently deploying. We are talking about a contest between nations to win the hearts and minds of people globally. Britain, the United States, France, India and so many other countries have implemented this policy. Now the Saudis are doing the same,"" adds Prof Chadwick
The second key objective behind Saudi Arabia's spending spree is that it is part of a broader push to reinvent its economy before oil revenues start dwindling. Currently, they make up for more than 40% of the Saudi gross domestic product, or GDP.
Sports is one of the main pillars of the government's Vision 2030 project driven by the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The economic diversification programme is focused on reducing the country's reliance on fossil fuel revenues by building new industries and generating jobs.
""One of the objectives is to deliver entertainment for the Saudi population as part of Vision 2030 and at the same time, also develop local talent that would enhance the level of the Saudi Pro League in the long run,"" says Mr Nohra.
Saudi Arabia is a football loving nation with 80% of the population either playing, watching, or following the sport. It is still early to judge whether these bold investments will pay off, but the strategy has demonstrated the Gulf nation's strong desire to become a football powerhouse.

Why some right-wing activists zeroed in on the Jacksonville shooting,"In the hours after a racially motivated shooting in Jacksonville, Florida over the weekend, parts of the fringe right and far-right of American politics were quick to compare it with a previous mass shooting - alleging a politically motivated cover-up and conspiracy. But their claims run counter to facts laid out by police and extremism experts.
The messages began just a short time after news broke of the murder of three black people by a white man in his 20s. 
One typical post from one influencer on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, was seen at least 1.4 million times by Monday evening - and just one of hundreds of similar posts.
They all claimed or implied that the documents left by the Jacksonville gunman were publicly released by authorities, and compared the situation to a shooting at a Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee in March. That assault left three children and three adults dead before the attacker was killed by police. 
No documents or manifestos written by the attackers have been released in either case. 
Some fringe accounts and far-right activists claimed that the Nashville shooting was motivated by gender ideology or hatred of Christians and hinted at a politically motivated cover-up to hide the truth.
But this narrative doesn't fit the facts, according to experts and law enforcement statements. 
Although police initially cited journals and other writings left by the Nashville shooter, officials later clarified that the documents did not amount to a ""manifesto"" - a clear statement of ideology and intent describing the motivations behind such a horrific crime. 
Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director David Rausch later told news outlets that describing the documents as a manifesto was a ""mischaracterisation"".
""Ideological expressions - none of that has surfaced in these writings,"" Mr Rausch told a religious news site. ""It's really unfortunate mental health issues that you can see as you read through the journals.""
He also told a meeting of sheriffs in April that the shooter had no clear motive or ideology. 
There's another factor which has so far prevented the release of the journals. 
""In the case of the Nashville shooting, the families of the victims are fighting a legal battle against releasing the killer's writings,"" says Sara Aniano, a disinformation analyst at the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism.
In the Jacksonville case, law enforcement officials said they saw clear evidence of motivation in the murderer's writings. 
""He targeted a certain group of people, and that's black people,"" Sheriff TK Waters said in a news conference after the attack.

Watch: Jacksonville shootings: 'He hated black people'
Photos of the guns used in the shooting, which police say were purchased legally, showed crude drawings of swastikas and slogans painted on the firearms. 
Contrary to many of the tweets claiming the two cases were handled differently, the Jacksonville writings - like the Nashville documents - have not been publicly released. 
Nor is there evidence that the Florida shooter posted them online prior to his murder spree. Extremism experts and journalists have been unable to find copies online.
Ms Aniano says that despite the lack of clarity about motive, the Nashville mass shooting has been a fixation of some activists online because of reports that the killer, a former student at the school, was a transgender man.
""Calls to release the manifesto on the far-right have been pervasive since it happened,"" she says. ""It's based on the hope that the manifesto somehow proves that so-called gender ideology is dangerous. That's why they so badly want to see it.
""Of course it's natural and understandable for people to want insight into what might cause someone to do a mass shooting,"" Ms Aniano notes, but experts say it's not always a good idea to release such documents, for fears they will glorify killers and inspire other mass shootings. 
The response by some activists to the Jacksonville murders is part of a larger pattern of attempts to deflect attention away from white supremacist and neo-Nazi motives. 
When a man with a swastika tattoo opened fire at a mall in Texas in May, killing eight people, activists tried to cast doubt on reports that the killer might have been motivated by far-right beliefs. 
They claimed - without evidence - that the shooting was somehow part of a ""psychological operation"" or that the killer's social media accounts were ""fake"".
While such rumours seem fringe and scarcely believable, they spread to millions and were even repeated by Elon Musk. 
In the Jacksonville case, Ms Aniano says, ""they don't want the young white male to be demonised, because these same activists believe that young white males are the ones under attack"". 
And even if the Nashville documents were to be released and indicated a lack of clear motivation - as authorities have said - Ms Aniano says fringe influencers will still find ways to spin them to fit their narrative.

Jacksonville shooting: DeSantis booed at vigil for victims of racist attack,"This video can not be played
Watch: Ron DeSantis is booed at a vigil after a racially-motivated shooting in Jacksonville
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been loudly booed at a vigil for victims of a racially motivated shooting.
The Republican candidate for president was heckled in Jacksonville, where hundreds gathered on Sunday to remember the three victims of the attack.
He was forced to step back from the microphone before a member of the city council asked the crowd to listen.
""It ain't about parties today,"" Ju'Coby Pittman said, adding: ""A bullet don't know a party.""
Mr DeSantis, 44, who has loosened gun laws in the state and faced criticism from civil rights leaders for targeting what he calls ""woke ideology"", eventually spoke and called the gunman a ""scumbag"" which prompted applause from some of the crowd.
Around 200 people attended the vigil, which took place in a predominantly black area just yards away from the Dollar General shop where the shooting happened the previous day.
Twenty-one year old Ryan Christopher Palmeter fired eleven rounds at 52 year-old Angela Carr who was sitting in her vehicle, before entering the shop and shooting another two people dead.
Anolt Laguerre Jr, 19, worked at the Dollar General and was killed as he tried to flee.
Jerrald De'Shaun Gallion, 29, was shot dead as he entered the premises. Another woman was chased but managed to escape.
As police arrived, the attacker turned a gun on himself and died at the scene. An AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and a Glock handgun, both legally obtained, were used in the shooting.
Police have said the gunman was motivated by racist hatred. 
""He knew what he was doing. He was 100% lucid,"" Sheriff T K Waters told reporters. ""Finely put: this shooting was racially motivated and he hated black people.""
He left behind racist messages, police said, which read like ""the diary of a madman"".
The gunman was detained for 72 hours in 2017 under mental health legislation that allows the involuntary detainment of an individual for treatment. He was released after the examination, police said, which is why it did not appear on his background checks when purchasing the guns.
Mr DeSantis said financial support would be provided to bolster security at the historically black Edward Waters University, near to where the shooting happened. 
The gunman first went to the university campus, where he was asked to identify himself by a security officer. When he refused, he was asked to leave. He was then seen putting on a bullet-resistant vest and a mask before leaving the area.
""What he did is totally unacceptable in the state of Florida,"" Mr DeSantis said. ""We are not going to let people be targeted based on their race.""
Bishop John Guns, referring to Mr Gallion, told the crowd: ""In two weeks I have to preach a funeral of a man who should still be alive. I wept in church today like a baby because my heart is tired. We are exhausted.""
The shooting fell on the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for civil rights, where Dr Martin Luther King Jr gave his famous 'I have a dream' speech. 
President Joe Biden, during remarks on the anniversary on Monday, called the shooting an ""act of domestic violence extremism"".
""Domestic terrorism rooted in white supremacy is the greatest terrorist threat we face in the homeland,"" Mr Biden said. 
The president also renewed calls for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. 
US Attorney General Merrick Garland earlier said the shooting was being investigated as a hate crime.

India Club in London: Iconic restaurant to shut after 70 years,"The place is nondescript; if you don't look for it, you may not find it. And yet, for over 70 years, many Indians in London have sought it out, looking for familiar flavours and faces - a taste of home abroad.
The India Club - an iconic lounge-cum-restaurant and bar - that sits inside the Hotel Strand Continental on a busy stretch of road in central London, has been a historically and culturally significant space for the South Asian community in the city for decades.
It was set up in the 1950s as a place for early Indian immigrants to meet and connect, but now the India Club is set to shut down as the owners of the building it is housed in want to demolish a part of the structure to set up a more modernised hotel. 
Many patrons say they are saddened by the news as the closure of the Club will lead to the city losing a part of its history.
The Club has been battling against closure for years. A couple of years ago, its owners - Yadgar Marker and his daughter, Phiroza - won their battle against the demolition after their campaign to save the place received thousands of signatures.
But last week, they told the press that 17 September would be the last day the Club would remain open.
The news has come as a blow to many as the place is steeped in history. Located on the first floor of the Hotel Strand Continental, the India Club was started by the members of the India League - a Britain-based organisation that campaigned for India's independence in the 1900s. India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru is said to have been among the Club's founding members. The Markers bought the lease to the property in the 1990s.
Reports say that India's freedom activists initially used the Club as a meeting space, but later it became a place for people from the South Asian community to forge friendships over shared meals and events.
""In the 1950s and 60s, it was the only place Indians could go to meet people who spoke their language and ate their food,"" says Kusoom Vadgama, a historian who regularly visited the Club after she moved to the UK in 1953. 
""The India Club helped all of us feel a little less alone in our new home,"" she said, adding that people would often meet there to celebrate birthdays, weddings or even Indian festivals like Diwali - the Hindu festival of lights. 
Ms Vadgama grew up under colonial rule in East Africa and moved to the UK to study. Many people from India had also immigrated to the UK in the years following the country's independence, but there were hardly any cultural establishments for the Indian diaspora in London back then, she said.
The India Club filled this gaping hole for the community. It served up dishes that were familiar to the Indian palate, such as south Indian staples like dosas (a pancake made from fermented rice) and sambhar (a lentil gravy seasoned with spices); north Indian delicacies like butter chicken (chicken cooked in a buttery curry); Indian street food like pakoras (vegetable fritters) and, of course, coffee and masala chai (milk tea infused with spices).
Even the interiors of the Club were designed to mimic the coffee shops of pre-independence India, where people met to chat about culture and politics over cigarettes and cups of chai. The chandeliers, Formica tables and straight-backed chairs of the Club have remained largely unchanged since it was set up more than 70 years ago.
In an ode to its rich socio-political history, the walls are lined with portraits of prominent Indian and British personalities who visited over the years, such as Dadabhai Naoroji, the first British Indian MP, and philosopher Bertrand Russell.
Over the years, the Club became a popular ""watering hole"" for not just immigrants, but people from all walks of life, including journalists and for various India-British groups and associations.
Journalist and author Shrabani Basu remembers frequenting the restaurant with fellow journalists in the 1980s. ""It was one of the few places that served affordable Indian food in central London,"" she says, adding that the India Club is like the city's ""hidden secret"", and she loves taking friends and family who visit from India there.
Smita Tharoor, a motivational speaker, says her father Chandan Tharoor, who was one of the Club's founding members, had a lot of fun stories about the place which he frequented as a bachelor, including one about ""a bar lady who would refuse to serve drinks to men she thought were drunk"".
When he came to visit her in London years later, her father took her to the Club. Since then, Ms Tharoor has become a regular visitor too. ""After my father passed away, I held an event at the India Club in his honour. I also held my husband's 50th birthday there,"" she says. ""The India Club has a very special place in our hearts, and it's sad to see it go. Now, only the memories remain,"" she says.

Terry Gou: The Taiwan iPhone billionaire who wants to be president,"Terry Gou, a 72-year-old billionaire and founder of iPhone maker Foxconn, has become the latest to join the race for Taiwan's presidency. 
Mr Gou is a charismatic businessman with a great rags-to-riches story, pots of cash, and serious name recognition. Observers in Taipei say if he was the only candidate standing against the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Mr Gou would have a good shot. But he isn't.
Instead, his candidacy will split the opposition vote three ways in the January 2024 presidential election. 
In a winner-takes-all presidential system, when there are already two opposition candidates vying to unseat the incumbent party, adding a third probably isn't going to make the task easier. 
The scenario is a classic case for the ""law of holes"", which says that if you are in a hole and it's difficult to get out, the first thing to do is stop digging.  And Taiwan's opposition appears to be digging its own electoral grave. 
That is exactly what happened on Monday when Mr Guo announced his candidacy for an election that has profound consequences well beyond Taiwan. The self-governed island will elect a new president amid growing threats from Beijing, and an increasingly militarised region.  
Like another charismatic businessman across the Pacific, Mr Gou first attempted to get himself made the candidate of Taiwan's main right-of-centre party, the old nationalist KMT (Kuomintang). Unlike in the United States, he failed. 
The KMT chose another candidate, and Mr Gou quit the party in disgust. But the KMT isn't Mr Gou's only problem.
Taiwan has another opposition party, called the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), and it is led by another charismatic populist called Ko Wen-je. Mr Ko is the former mayor of Taipei city and is currently running second in polls. He is doing particularly well among younger Taiwanese voters.
Mr Gou's main selling points are not just his wealth and business success. It is his experience working in and with China. 
Foxconn, or Hon Hai industries, became the world's biggest electronics manufacturer by pioneering the model of combining Taiwanese engineering knowhow with skilled Chinese labour. In the 1980s and 90s Mr Gou built huge manufacturing campuses in southern China and recruited tens of thousands of young Chinese to work in them. 
The model was so successful he eventually persuaded Apple to outsource much of the manufacturing of MacBooks and iPhones to Foxconn. It made Foxconn Taiwan's biggest company and Mr Gou one of its richest entrepreneurs.
Now Mr Gou says he can use that same experience of investing and working in China to protect Taiwan's security. Terry Gou says he wants to prevent Taiwan from ""becoming another Ukraine"". Announcing his candidacy, he said he would lead Taiwan ""back from the abyss of war with China"". 
He is not the only one who sees the threat from China as increasingly perilous. In the last year Beijing has hugely increased its military operations around the island. 
Last week the People's Liberation Army released a highly produced propaganda video showing Chinese troops practising for what looked very much like an invasion of Taiwan's beaches.
China and Taiwan: A really simple guide
The difference is who Mr Gou blames - not Beijing, but Taiwan's own President Tsai Ying-wen. 
He says it is the incumbent DPP's hostility to Beijing that has led Taiwan to the edge of this ""abyss"". Mr Gou says he would return Taiwan to a previous status quo negotiated between Beijing and Taipei back in 1992 and further, he says, he would seal an agreement that would bring peace to the island for the next 50 years.  
There are many here who are deeply sceptical of whether such an agreement is attainable. 
But that is not Mr Gou's biggest challenge. Instead, it is the electoral maths. What Mr Gou is proposing is just not that popular with Taiwan's electorate. 
Opinion polls here show most Taiwanese do not believe it is their government that is to blame for the growing tensions with Beijing. They are not in favour of making concessions to Beijing on sovereignty in order to secure peace. A large majority of Taiwan voters now identify themselves as Taiwanese, not Chinese, and say they would be prepared to fight to defend the sovereignty of their home. 
Opinion polls also show that around 40% of voters are strong supporters of the DPP. That means the ruling party can be beaten. But to have any chance the opposition would have to unite around a single candidate. 
Mr Gou clearly thinks that should be him. He says the three opposition candidates are like ""the three little pigs"" who must unite to defeat the ""big bad wolf"" of the DPP. 
But there is no sign of that happening. Rather, despite his wealth and fame, Mr Gou's candidacy is more likely to divide the opposition vote further. 
And that means, even with just 40% of the vote, William Lai from the DPP is still the most likely candidate to become Taiwan's next president.

Jacksonville shooting: Mourners honour victims of racist attack,"A fun-loving young father, a caring mother and a teenage cashier - all black - were killed in a racially motivated weekend shooting in Florida.
Officials have identified the three victims as Jerrald De'Shaun Gallion, 29; Angela Michelle Carr, 52; and, Anolt Joseph ""AJ"" Laguerre Jr, 19.
Police said there was little logic to the white gunman's violent actions but that he clearly ""hated black people"".
The attack in Jacksonville is being investigated as a federal hate crime.
""We have three people who are dead because they are black,"" Democratic state lawmaker Tracie Davis said at a vigil the next day.
""The division has to stop, the hate has to stop, the rhetoric has to stop,"" Mayor Donna Deegan told fellow mourners. ""We are all the same flesh, blood and bones and we should treat each other that way.""
The suspect, armed with a Glock pistol and an AR-15 type rifle, shot at shoppers and employees at a Dollar General store in a predominantly black area of Jacksonville, the most populous city in the state.
Surveillance footage shows the gunman firing 11 rounds into a black Kia sedan parked in front of the store before he walks into the premises.
Here's what we know about the victims:
Ms Carr was an Uber driver who had just dropped off a friend at the shop, her son said.
""She would give her shirt off her back for people,"" Chayvaughn Payne, 30, told the New York Times. ""This is really hard to process. To lose a mother for nothing.""
Mr Payne said his mother was the kind of person who would invite others to cookouts and other family events.
Another son, Vaughn Blanco, shared the news of his loss in a series of emotional Facebook posts over the weekend.
""My momma gone man she was robbed of her life man robbed,"" he wrote in one.
""I know we going through things with our parents but call me them make sure they good man you never know how you're last conversation maybe,"" read another.
Police say Mr Laguerre, the gunman's second victim, was shot as he tried to flee the Dollar General store.
His father told vigil attendees the young man had recently graduated from high school and was working at the store as a cashier.
""He hasn't even lived his life yet,"" Anolt Laguerre said.
In a statement, Dollar General confirmed the younger Laguerre had been an employee. 
""There is no place for hate at Dollar General or in the communities we serve,"" the retailer said, adding it was ""focused on providing support, counseling and resources to our teams and their loved ones"".
Mr Gallion, the third victim, was shot and killed as he walked through the retail store's front door with his girlfriend.
The young father had planned to spend the weekend with his four-year-old daughter.
""My heart melted for my grand-daughter,"" said Sabrina Rozier, his mother-in-law. ""She was his world and he was her world.""
""And now we're trying to figure out how to tell her, because we haven't told her yet,"" she added. ""We don't know yet.""
Mr Gallion's sister, Latiffany, recalled his sense of humour and work ethic. ""My brother shouldn't have lost his life,"" she said, ""A simple day of going to the store, and he's taken away from us forever.""
The restaurant manager attended the local St Paul Missionary Baptist church, according to its senior pastor.
""In two weeks, I have to preach a funeral of a man who should still be alive,"" Bishop John Guns said Sunday.
""He was not a gangster, he was not a thug — he was a father who gave his life to Jesus and was trying to get it together. I wept in church today like a baby because my heart is tired. We are exhausted.""
More than 28,000 Americans have died in gun violence this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive not for profit.
Saturday's attack coincided with the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington, a pivotal demonstration in the black civil rights movement.

A muddy reveal for mysterious West Point time capsule from 1820s,"This video can not be played
Watch: The first peek into a mysterious time capsule at a US military academy
Staff and students at West Point, the famed US military academy, gathered on Monday for what was supposed to be a historic moment: the opening of a mysterious 1820s time capsule, discovered months ago at the base of a campus monument. 
The event was live-streamed, starting with pre-recorded remarks from academy historian Jennifer Voigtschild, inviting the audience to ""literally uncover a piece of West Point history"". Cadets were filmed offering their own predictions for what was inside the nearly 200-year-old lead box: an American flag, boots, or maybe a class ring. 
But instead, there was mud. 
For the 30 minutes prior, an auditorium full of cadets had watched as Ms Voigtschild led the school through the breathless build-up, inviting some of West Point's top brass on stage to celebrate the exciting moment. 
In front of them, centre stage, was the grey box - 12in by 12in by 13in (30cm by 30cm by 33cm) - and two school employees, standing by with purple rubber gloves and white masks, prepared to unveil its contents. 
The box had been found a few months earlier, during the removal of a bronze statue of war hero Thaddeus Kosciuszko. Underneath the marble face of the monument the box was discovered, apparently placed there during the completion of the statute in 1829.
""We're guessing that it's an artefact, or what we would call today a time capsule, put there when the monument was completed in 1829,"" Ms Voigtschild said from stage. 
But they were just guessing, she explained, because West Point researchers could find no reference to a box, artefact, time capsule or any other object being placed inside the base of the Kosciuszko statue. And because the box was made of lead, an x-ray of the suspected time capsule showed only some ""anomalies"" in the interior - taken a sign of something, though no one was sure what. 
The auditorium fell quiet when the box was eventually opened, the lid carefully pried open with a metal tool. The camera of the livestream zoomed close, capturing the painstaking efforts. Once safely opened, one employee took a tiny flashlight, scanning the box's contents. 
He found nothing. 
""We're not sure if it's soil or mud or dust,"" he said, adding later: ""The box didn't quite meet expectations.""
Still, maintaining hope that West Point's ancestors didn't actually leave a box of dirt to be found centuries later, the silt will be carefully inspected for any special contents. 
""I am sure some in our audience have questions for our various experts up on stage?"" Ms Voigtschild said after the mud was found. 
There were none.

Trump faces 4 March 2024 trial just a day before Super Tuesday,"Donald Trump, seeking a return to the White House in 2024, already had a crammed political calendar. Now, with multiple legal dramas set to unfold, it is approaching the point of pure chaos.
A federal judge has scheduled the trial for his alleged effort to overturn the 2020 election for 4 March, the day before Super Tuesday, the biggest voting day in the Republican race.
That trial - in Washington DC - would pull Mr Trump off the campaign trail for a pivotal stretch of his campaign, when he could be securing himself as the Republican standard-bearer or engaged in an extended struggle with one or more remaining rivals.
Mr Trump's lawyers have already vigorously complained about proposed trial schedules conflicting with the presidential campaign, which the former president and his supporters have branded ""election interference"" by his enemies. 
Mr Trump has vowed to appeal the trial date ruling. In a post on his social media site, he derided the judge as ""biased"" and ""Trump hating"" and said the timing was ""just what our corrupt government wanted"".
Mr Trump's legal team had initially proposed an April 2026 date for the federal trial - a timeline the judge said was unacceptable.
While the first presidential nomination contest, in Iowa, isn't until January, the Republican presidential race has already begun in earnest. The party has started holding monthly debates for qualifying candidates. The first took place in Wisconsin in August - and Mr Trump stayed away, saying an appearance was not necessary given his large polling lead over his rivals. 
The schedule, however, provided an early indication of how his legal concerns could factor into his political calculations. The former president appeared in an Atlanta jail the day after the debate, where he was formally booked on charges of interfering in the Georgia 2020 election.
While much of Mr Trump's legal - and political - drama will take place in 2024, there's already one trial scheduled for later this year. On 2 October, New York state's civil fraud lawsuit against Mr Trump and his business empire is scheduled to go to trial. Mr Trump is not required to appear in court, but it still could be a distraction - and it comes just five days after the second scheduled Republican primary debate.
When the calendar flips to 2024, things start to really heat up. The Iowa caucuses - the first Republican presidential selection contest - are scheduled for 15 January, the same day a defamation trial against Mr Trump begins. It is the second case brought by writer E Jean Carroll, who has already won a $5m (£3.9m) judgement from the former president after a jury found he sexually assaulted and defamed her.
Mr Trump's New York hush-money case is scheduled for trial in late March, a few weeks after the federal 6 January trial is currently on tap to begin in Washington, DC. The federal case involving mishandling classified documents is set for May. That will be after many of the key Republican primaries have taken place. But preparation for those cases, including pre-trial hearings and depositions, will begin well beforehand.
Then there is the Georgia indictment, which is yet to be scheduled.
Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis has said she wants her sprawling racketeering case against Mr Trump and 18 co-defendants to reach trial within six months, but that timeline is also ambitious, given that one defendant is requesting the proceedings be moved to federal court and a second is calling for an earlier trial.
All the presiding judges in these cases will take into consideration Mr Trump's legal concerns, as well as the campaign timeline, and attempt to work out a schedule that best accommodates all the competing interests.

Watch: Trump surrenders at Georgia jail...in 74 seconds
In the second half of 2024, those interests include a Republican national convention that is slated for mid-July, and the traditional series of presidential debates that take place in early autumn. At some point the possibility of a trial in the shadow of November's presidential election - or even after it - becomes a real possibility.
The trials - and any pre-trial hearings, depositions and other various legal proceedings - will take up weeks if not months of Mr Trump's time. He will have to schedule his campaigning, including his beloved mass public rallies, around them. He could have judges issuing orders to limit what he can publicly say - and sanctioning him if he does not comply.
Then there's the massive financial drain that supporting multiple teams of lawyers to contest the criminal charges against Mr Trump and his associates presents. A Trump-affiliated political committee has already spent more than $40m on legal fees just in the first half of 2023, with the first criminal trial still months away.
Those numbers will only go up - and they will continue to limit the amount of money the former president can direct to the nuts and bolts of his campaign, such as grass-roots organising, television and online advertisements, and staff and infrastructure investments.
It is a daunting burden for any candidate - even one who has shown Mr Trump's remarkable political durability.

Zambia-Egypt plane seizure: The cash and fake gold that no-one is claiming,"A private plane found with more than $5m (£4m) in cash, fake gold, guns and ammunition on board is at the centre of a deepening investigation in the Zambian capital, Lusaka.
Everyone knows the aircraft flew from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, and landed a fortnight ago in Zambia, but that is where the certainties stop. So far nobody in Egypt or Zambia admits to chartering the plane or owning its contents. 
With so many questions unanswered rumours have been swirling. 
Could those involved be high-level Egyptian or Zambian political or military figures? Was this a one-off flight or the first out of hundreds to finally be rumbled? 
What is known so far is that five Egyptians aboard the aircraft and six Zambians appeared at a magistrate's court in Lusaka on Monday. 
Both the Egyptians and Zambians have been charged with smuggling and corrupt practices. The Zambians also face espionage charges. Among the Zambians appearing in court was an official at State House, the official residence and office of the president. None were asked to enter a plea.
The world might have remained oblivious to it all were it not for a journalist whose fact-checking website, Matsda2sh, accused officials in Egypt of involvement in the incident.
Soon after that Egyptian plainclothes security forces raided Karim Asaad's Cairo home in the dead of night and arrested him.
At first he just disappeared. Nobody knew where or why Mr Asaad had been taken. 
Then independent Egyptian journalists published documents over social media purportedly taken from the Zambian police investigation into the cash-filled aircraft. 
These reportedly named three Egyptian military officers and a senior police officer among those arrested, backing up Mr Asaad's allegations.
A barrage of protests on social media, many of them from fellow journalists, led to his release two days later. What exactly he had been arrested for remains another mystery.
The Egyptian authorities would only say that the aircraft mentioned on Mr Asaad's website was privately owned and merely transited through Cairo. In other words, the country and its officials had nothing to do with the case. 
Soon after that the spotlight shifted to Zambia after the plane touched down at Lusaka's Kenneth Kaunda Airport. 
Somehow, it seems, a Zambian man carrying bags of what looked like gold was allowed to stroll through security and meet the newly arrived Egyptians on the plane. 
Nobody appears to know who authorised this but, according to Zambian media reports, a few cash handouts had helped ease his path.
After he climbed aboard the man allegedly sold a portion of the supposed gold he was carrying to the men on the plane. They then asked him for more. 
What is not clear is if they managed to discover that what he was selling was actually counterfeit before security staff arrived to search the aircraft. 
The arrest, it seems, was not straightforward. 
Several of the officers who entered the plane are now being investigated for allegedly receiving up to $200,000 each from the Egyptian nationals aboard the plane. It is claimed this was their reward for allowing the plane to take off without arresting anyone. 
When word somehow got out that wads of money on the plane were allegedly changing hands, another group of security staff charged on to the aircraft and arrested those inside. 
Presumably the suspects had trouble explaining what they were doing with millions of dollars in cash, several pistols, 126 rounds of ammunition and what looked like more than 100kg of gold bars. 
The gold bars were particularly puzzling. 
It turned out that, as well as gold, they were made from a mixture of copper, nickel, tin and zinc. All that glitters is clearly not gold. 
It seems the Egyptians aboard the plane may have been saved from a very bad deal. 
The Zambian lawyer acting for one of the 10 arrested men said another mystery was why the security forces seemed so bad at maths. 
Makebi Zulu told the BBC that at first police said they had found $11m in cash. This, he went on, was later downgraded to around $7m before finally settling on the sum of $5.7m.
One possible explanation could lie in reports that nearly half of the money had been taken off the plane before the arresting team arrived. If true that would mean those involved staggering through the airport with more than $5m - a little hard to do discreetly.
Mr Zulu is also perplexed about the disparate treatment of the men since their arrest.
He says that while the Zambian and three other foreigners were sent to jail to await their day in court, the six Egyptians were put up in a guest house. Have, he suggested, VIPs in Cairo been leaning on the Zambian authorities? 
The man who allegedly carried the bags of fake gold on to the plane has since turned whistleblower and is reported to be helping Zambian police get to the bottom of all this. 
Over the last couple of days several more Zambian nationals have been arrested at a makeshift fake-gold processing plant, and more arrests may well follow. 
As interest in the case around the world has grown, so has speculation. 
A think-tank called the Egypt Technocrats, made up of independent Egyptian professionals living around the globe, claims there are more than 300 secret companies inside Egypt involved in money laundering operations.
Some say vast amounts of money may have been smuggled out of the country since President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi came to power nine years ago. If true, could this flight be just one of hundreds that have made similar trips? 
The theory being advanced in some circles is that senior military officials and businessmen in Egypt, fearful that President Sisi's regime could collapse, have been desperately trying to get their money out of the country.  
Though as with everything to do with this mysterious case, nobody can be sure how much of all this is true.
The hope is that when a trial finally takes place many of the questions raised will be answered. 
The danger is, however, that it might just lead to even more questions.

Abkhazia profile,"Situated in the north-western corner of Georgia with the Black Sea to the south-west and the Caucasus mountains and Russia to the north-east, Abkhazia was once known as a prime holiday destination for the Soviet elite.
The region fought and won a war of secession with Georgia in 1992-93, and formally declared independence in 1999. Its independence has gained little international recognition, most countries regard it as a part of Georgia.  
After the Georgian-Russian war in 2008, Moscow recognized the region as an independent state. Georgia responded by declaring Abkhazia ""occupied"" by Russia.
Abkhazia's economy depends overwhelmingly on tourism from Russia and in recent years it has drifted closer to Russia. In 2009 Moscow signed a five-year agreement with Abkhazia to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper, while in 2014 Russia and the region signed a ""strategic partnership"" agreement.
President: Aslan Bzhania
Aslan Bzhania was elected with around 59% of the vote in Abkhazia's March 2020 presidential elections.
In December 2021 opposition protesters clashed with police in the capital Sukhumi. The opposition accused the authorities of failing to deal effectively with Covid-19 and of failing to manage Abkhazia's energy network properly.
Russian TV and Abkhazian state TV are the main sources of news. Major Russian stations are relayed in the territory. The only private TV, Abaza TV, is licensed to cover the entire region.
There is little or no access to Georgian TV, other than by satellite.
The Abkhaz government publishes newspapers in Abkhaz and Russian. Several private papers publish alongside official titles.
Internet usage is growing fast.
Some key dates in Abkhazia's history:
756 - Independent kingdom formed.
985 - Becomes part of Georgia, later regaining independence.
1578 - Comes under Turkish rule.
1810 - Russia declares Abkhazia a protectorate.
1864 - Russia annexes Abkhazia.
1918 - Independent Georgian state - including Abkhazia - declared in wake of Russian Revolution.
1921 - Red Army invades, Georgia absorbed into emerging Soviet Union. Abkhazia becomes a separate soviet republic, with the ambiguous status of a treaty republic associated with the Georgian soviet republic.
1931 - Soviet authorities incorporate Abkhazia into Georgia. 
1991 - Georgia declares independence.
1992-93 - Georgia-Abkhazia War: Georgia sends troops to Abkhazia to halt moves for secession. Fierce fighting ends with Georgian forces being expelled from Abkhazia. Up to 30,000 people are killed. Before the war Georgians make up nearly half of Abkhazia's population, but up to 250,000 Georgians and others are expelled, virtually halving Abkhazia's population.
1994 - Ceasefire agreed, peacekeepers arrive, nearly all Russian. 
1999 - Abkhazia declares independence. Few countries recognise this.
2008 - As war between Russian and Georgian forces breaks out in South Ossetia, Abkhaz forces clash with Georgian troops in the Kodori Gorge in Abkhazia. Russia sends in troops to support the Abkhazians. Georgian forces and civilians evacuate the last part of Abkhazia under Georgian government control
Russia formally recognises Abkhazia's independence, following the Russian-Georgian war over South Ossetia.
2014 - Russia and Abkhazia sign a ""strategic partnership"" agreement. Georgia accuses Moscow of seeking to annex Abkhazia.
2020 - Raul Khadzhimba becomes second president in six years to be forced from office by public protests.

South Ossetia profile," South Ossetia seceded from Georgia in 1992 and proclaimed itself an independent republic. Georgia and the vast majority of UN countries do not recognize this independence. 
Both Georgia and international organisations often refer to the area informally as the Tskhinvali region.
South Ossetia saw a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008. Moscow subsequently recognised South Ossetia as an independent state, and began a process of closer ties that Georgia views as effective annexation.
South Ossetia is inhabited mostly by Ossetians, who speak a language distantly related to Persian. Most ethnic Georgians have been displaced from the region by the two conflicts. They had accounted for about a third of the population prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
South Ossetia is separated from Russia's North Ossetia region by a border running high in the Caucasus mountains.
President: Alan Gagloev
Gagloev became president of South Ossetia following the April 2022 presidential elections. One of his first acts was to cancel a referendum on unification with Russia, which had been planned for July 2022 until consultations with Moscow were complete.
During his election campaign he said his priority would be the development of the region's economy. In his inauguration speech he said that allied relations and integration with Russia would be ""the main vector of our republic's foreign policy.""
There is little media activity in South Ossetia beyond the state broadcaster and state news agency.
Moscow-based TV and radio channels are relayed extensively. A handful of private newspapers publish only sporadically.
Some key dates in South Ossetia's history: 
18th/19th Centuries - Russian empire expands southwards into the Caucasus.
1920s - Ossetians ally with the Bolshevik forces that occupy Georgia. The USSR divides the area into two administrative regions.
1980s/90s - Nationalist leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia comes to power in Georgia, separatist sentiment grows in South Ossetia.
1990-92 - After several outbreaks of violence, South Ossetia declares its intention to secede from Georgia and proclaims independence in 1992. Sporadic violence involving Georgian irregular forces and Ossetian fighters continues until agreement on the deployment of Georgian, Ossetian and Russian peacekeepers is reached.
2008 - Tensions between Georgia and Russia escalate into a full-blown military conflict after Georgia tries to retake South Ossetia by force following lower-level clashes with Russian-backed rebels.
Russian forces counter-attack and push Georgian troops out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After five days of fighting, the two sides sign a French-brokered peace agreement. Russia recognises both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states - very few other countries do. 
2009 - Russia bolsters its position in South Ossetia by signing a five-year agreement to take formal control of its frontiers with Georgia proper, as well as those of Abkhazia.
2015 - Russia signs an ""alliance and integration agreement"" with South Ossetia that abolishes border checkpoints. Georgia views this as a closer step towards Russian annexation of the region. Russian forces push the border fence 1.5km further into Georgia proper - a short distance from Georgia's main west-east highway.
2017 - Region votes to rename itself the State of Alania. Alania was originally a medieval kingdom in the central North Caucasus, but there is a dispute in the region over who are the historic heirs of this kingdom.
2022 - South Ossetia announces it will open checkpoints with Georgia for 10 days a month.

Chechnya profile,"The southern Russian republic of Chechnya has long been a boiling point for conflict with Moscow in the restive North Caucasus.
After a decade of unsuccessfully fighting for independence, the autonomous region is now firmly under the control of its Russian-appointed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, although separatist groups continue low-level guerrilla attacks. 
In addition, jihadist groups, including those aligned with Islamic State terrorist organization, exist in the region. 
Oil-rich Chechnya has enjoyed a period of relative stability under Mr Kadyrov. But critics have accused the pro-Moscow leader and his government of suppressing media and other freedoms, as well as human rights violations including kidnappings and torture.
President: Ramzan Kadyrov
Ramzan Kadyrov, son of assassinated President Akhmad Kadyrov and a former rebel fighter, was nominated for the Chechen presidency by Russian President Vladimir Putin in spring 2007.
He has become one of the most powerful and most feared men in Russia, and the Kremlin relies on him to maintain order in Chechnya - a republic he rules like a personal fiefdom.
With the centralisation of political power in Russia under President Putin, Kadyrov is one of the few leaders of a constituent republic to have retained a sizeable measure of political independence.
Human rights groups have criticised him for allowing serious human rights violations to flourish in the republic. The United States has imposed financial sanctions on Kadyrov, accusing him of a systematic campaign of repression. 
He has defended himself against critics, insisting that iron rule is required to bring stability.
Reporters Without Borders includes President Kadyrov on its list of ""Predators of Press Freedom"". Chechnya has no opposition media. TV is the most popular medium and local broadcasts fall under state control. 
The Chechen government has taken steps to tighten online control. Mr Kadyrov is an enthusiastic social media user. 
Some key dates in Chechnya's history:
1858 - After decades of violent resistance, Chechnya is conquered by Russia following the defeat of Imam Shamil and his fighters, who had aimed to establish an Islamic state.

Dagestan profile,"Dagestan, which translates as ""land of the mountains"", is situated in Russia's North Caucasus with Chechnya and Georgia to the west, Azerbaijan to the south and the Caspian Sea to the east. It is one of 22 republics that are part of Russia.
So high are its peaks in some places that certain areas are accessible only by helicopter. The republic is also famed for its ethnic and linguistic diversity, being home to more than 30 languages.
Several dozen Muslim peoples have settled among the high valleys over the centuries.
The Avars form the largest ethnic group and account for about a fifth of the population. A further substantial proportion is made up of Dargins, Kumyks and Lezgins. About 10% are ethnic Russians. There are also Laks, Tabasarans and Nogai, to name but a few of the other significant groups. It is Russia's most ethnically diverse province.
The republic has oil and gas reserves and also the fisheries potential offered by a share in the resources of the Caspian sea. However, it is prey to organized crime and regional instability. 
Television is the most popular source for news and entertainment. Local relays of Russian networks are widely available.
Independent journalists have faced repeated legal action against them, as well as threats of violence and attacks for their work.
Some key dates in Dagestan's modern history: 
19th Century - Dagestan is the birth place of Imam Shamil, who spearheads fierce resistance by tribesmen of Chechnya and Dagestan to the spread of the Russian empire. His name is still revered by many in both republics.
1920s - As the USSR seeks to enforce control in the Caucasus in the early 1920s, Dagestan becomes an autonomous Soviet republic within the Russian Federation. 
During the Stalinist period, its peoples escape the mass deportation inflicted on their Chechen neighbours and many others.
1991 - After the fall of the Soviet Union, the republic's authorities stay loyal to Russia but the region became infamous for its lawlessness and corruption.
1990s - Separatist warlords from neighbouring Chechnya lead armed operations in Dagestan on several occasions
1995-1996 - Chechen-led seize hundreds of hostages in hospitals in the Dagestani towns of Budennovsk and Kizlyar. Scores die in the attacks.
1999 - An Islamic body declares an independent state in parts of Dagestan and Chechnya, and calls on Muslims to take up arms against Russia in a holy war. Chechen fighters cross into Dagestan in support, but Russian forces suppress the insurrection within weeks.
2007-2017 - Islamist insurgency in North Caucus breaks out between Russia and militants associated with the Caucasus Emirate and, from 2015, Islamic State groups. Incidents are mostly concentrated in the North Caucasus republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.
2010 - Russia accuses Dagestani militant Magomed Vagabov of being behind a Moscow metro attack by two female suicide bombers from Dagestan, in which 39 people die. Russian forces kill Vagabov in Dagestan shortly afterwards. 
2015 - Aliaskhab Kebekov, leader of the Caucasus Emirate militant group is killed by Russian security forces. The group aims to establish an independent Islamic state in the region.
IS says it is behind a gun attack on the historic fortress of Derbent in which one person is killed and 11 are injured.
2017 - Russia's FSB internal intelligence agency says last insurgent underground group in the North Caucasus has been eliminated
2022 - Over 100 are arrested in clashes in Makhachkala with police in protests against Moscow's call-up of military reservists for the war in Ukraine and against the large number of servicemen from Dagestan who have been killed in the war.

Niger coup: France defies ultimatum for ambassador to leave Niamey,"France's ambassador has remained in Niger despite being given a 48-hour deadline to leave the country last Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed in a defiant speech.
Ambassador Sylvain Itte had been ordered to go amid rapidly deteriorating bilateral ties.
But hours after the coup leaders' deadline had passed, the president said he ""applauds"" Mr Itte for staying put.
The junta overthrew Niger's elected president last month.
In a major foreign policy speech to ambassadors gathered in Paris as well as others listening remotely, Mr Macron said: ""France and its diplomats have faced particularly difficult situations in some countries in recent months, from Sudan, where France has been exemplary, to Niger at this very moment.
""I applaud your colleague and your colleagues who are listening from their posts.""
Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum was toppled on 26 July in a coup that has been condemned by France and many of Niger's neighbours, including the West African regional bloc Ecowas.
Ambassador Itte had refused to meet Niger's new leaders after the coup, the junta said on Friday, as it announced the French ambassador had 48 hours to leave.
Thousands of Nigeriens in favour of the coup demonstrated on Sunday near the French military base in the capital, Niamey. 
Some held signs demanding the departure of French troops, while footage posted on social media appears to show local Muslim imams leading prayers outside the base.
In Monday's speech, Mr Macron defended France's military presence in Niger, stating that without intervention from Paris, the country would ""no longer exist"" with its ""existing borders"".
Neighbours Mali and Burkina Faso would also have suffered the same fate without France, Mr Macron said.
France carried out a decade-long operation to fight Islamic insurgents in Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania - all former French colonies - up until last year.
At its high point, around 5,500 French soldiers were stationed in the African countries.
However, anti-French sentiment and protests in the region intensified recently, with some opponents complaining France's intervention was a modern form of colonialism.
Others noted that the troops have not been able to overcome the threat from jihadists, whose deadly attacks on communities continue.
Amid this insecurity, soldiers in Mali, Burkina Faso and more recently Niger launched coups, saying a change of leadership was necessary to tackle the jihadists.
Mali's military government has called on the Russian mercenary group Wagner to help fight the Islamist militants. It is suspected that the mercenaries could be active in the wider region.

Ingushetia profile,"Ingushetia in the North Caucasus shares land borders with Georgia to its south and the Russian republics of North Ossetia-Alania and Chechnya to its west and east. It is one of the republics that make up Russia. 
The overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim and clan links are an integral part of society.
The Ingush and Chechen peoples have close historical, cultural and linguistic ties, although the Ingush have not shared in the fierceness of the resistance to Moscow put up by the Chechens over the past 200 years.
Part of the Russian empire since the early 19th Century, Ingushetia was formally joined to Chechnya under Soviet rule in 1936 when it formed around one-fifth of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Republic within Russia.
The authorities are accused of stifling media freedom and of silencing opposition. The meagre local media scene consists almost entirely of official outlets.
Ingushetia is ""a lawless zone where enemies of the press can attack journalists with impunity"", says the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
Key events in the modern history of Ingushetia:
1944 - Like the Chechens, the Ingush, despite their history of relative loyalty to Moscow, are deported to Central Asia towards the end of World War Two by Stalin who accuses them of collaborating with the Nazis. 
1957 - The exiles are only allowed home once Khrushchev is the Soviet leader.
1991 - When Dzhokhar Dudayev comes to power as Chechen leader and declares a Chechen sovereignty, the Ingush resist. A brief conflict ensues, and the Ingush subsequently vote in a referendum to form a separate republic within the Russia Federation.
The Ingush and North Ossetians have a history of rivalry. Ingushetia lays claim to the neighbouring Prigorodny district which was included in the Russian Republic of North Ossetia when Stalin deported the Ingush in 1944. For many years after their return, the district had a substantial Ingush population.
1992 - Violence between the two sides breaks out. The North Ossetians say it is sparked by Ingush radicals seeking to include Prigorodny in the newly formed Republic of Ingushetia. The Ingush say the North Ossetians attacked first and they acted in self defence.
Hundreds are killed in the clashes. Moscow sends troops to establish order. The Ingush population is expelled from the district, causing a refugee crisis in Ingushetia.
1999 - Thousands of Chechens flee into Ingushetia when Russian troops return to Chechnya.
2000s onwards - An Islamist insurgency in North Caucus breaks out between Russia and militants associated with the Caucasus Emirate and, from 2015, Islamic State groups. Incidents are mostly concentrated in the North Caucasus republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.
During this period militant attacks became a frequent occurrence in Ingushetia.
2004 - Several dozen people, including the acting Ingush interior minister, are killed in attacks reported to have involved hundreds of gunmen. These clashes prompt the Kremlin to order a change of leadership in a bid to reduce the level of violence.
2009 - A renewed spate of attacks, including a suicide bombing at a police station that killed at least 25 people - the deadliest attack in the republic since 2005 - and an attempt on the life of the then-President Yunus-Bek Yevkurov.
Moscow reacts by announcing another overhaul of security in the republic.
2010 - Security forces announce the arrest of a leading militant linked to the assassination attempt, and several other attacks.
Mr Yevkurov says militants have killed more than 400 members of the security forces and wounded more than 3,000 civilians since 2005. 
2017 - Russia's FSB internal intelligence agency says that the last insurgent underground group in the North Caucasus has been eliminated.
2023 - Three police officers are killed and eight others wounded in a shootout in northern Ingushetia. Two gunmen are also killed in the operation to arrest the group, following earlier shootings in the most significant upsurge in violence in Ingushetia since 2012.

North Ossetia profile,"One of Russia's smallest republics, ethnic Ossetians and Russians make up most of the population of North Ossetia. 
Rich in resources - including unexploited oil and gas reserves - North Ossetia is the most industrialised and urbanised republic in the North Caucasus. It also has tourism potential. 
During the early 21st Century, the republic was affected by the instability afflicting other parts of the region and the spill-over from the conflict in nearby Chechnya. 
Most media outlets are owned by, or under the influence of, the republic's government. Observers say TV, radio and press news content is dominated by official information. 
Key events in the history of North Ossetia:
Ossetians trace their identity and language back to the Iranian-speaking medieval kingdom of Alania - a fact reflected in the republic's formal name, ""Republic of North Ossetia-Alania"".
8th Century - Kingdom of Alania founded
9th/10th Century - Adopts Christianity.
1236-1330 - Caucasus region conquered by the Mongols.
17th Century - Under the nominal rule of Safavid Iran. 
1722-23 - Russo-Persian War: Russian gains territories in the Caucasus at the expense of Safavid Iran.
1774-1806 - Ossetia is incorporated into the Russian Empire, which  founds a military outpost at Vladikavkaz and splits the region into a northern and southern half.
1920s - The territory is part of the USSR's short-lived Soviet Mountain Republic - made up of six districts including Chechnya and Ingushetia. 
1936 - North Ossetia becomes an autonomous Soviet republic. 
1989-92 - Ossetian-Ingush conflict. Amid the collapse of the Soviet Union, an inter-ethnic conflict in the eastern part of North Ossetia develops into a brief war between local Ingush and Ossetian paramilitary forces. Up to 600 people were killed, and up to 60,000 Ingush were were forced to flee North Ossetia for Ingushetia. 
1990s - Thousands of South Ossetians flee from Georgia to North Ossetia amid ethnic tensions and violence. North Ossetia maintains strong ethnic links with the territory. 
1994 - North Ossetia changes its name to the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania.
2000s onwards - An Islamist insurgency in North Caucus breaks out between Russia and militants associated with the Caucasus Emirate and, from 2015, Islamic State groups. Incidents are mostly concentrated in the North Caucasus republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.
2004 - Armed attackers storm a school in the town of Beslan. In the violent end to the siege 330 people are killed; more than half of them children. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin says the attackers are terrorists with links to Chechen separatists and funding from al-Qaeda. He accuses them of seeking to unleash violence across the North Caucasus in order to strike at Russia's south. 
Ousted Chechen separatist president Aslan Maskhadov - killed just six months later - condemns the seizure of the school but blames Russian policy in Chechnya, describing the attackers as ""madmen"" seeking to avenge the Chechen people for atrocities carried out by Russians. 
2008 - War breaks out in the South Ossetia region of Georgia, just over the border from North Ossetia. Russian forces drive Georgian troops out of the region.
2010 - A bomb blast blamed on Islamist insurgents kills 17 people in the regional capital Vladikavkaz.
2017 - Russia's FSB security service kills four IS militants in a counter-terrorism operation south of Vladikavkaz near the border with Georgia.

Kabardino-Balkaria profile,"The Russian North Caucasus republic of Kabardino-Balkaria has low living standards, high unemployment, corruption and has had its share of violence, kidnappings and organised crime to contend with.
The economy relies heavily on subsidies from Moscow. It is home to the highest mountain in Europe, Mount Elbrus, (5,642m).
The population is made up of mainly-Muslim Kabardins, as well as minorities of Turkic-speaking Balkars - around 10% of the people - and Russians. 
There is friction between the Kabardins and the Balkars, and in 1992 the Balkars voted for secession.
During the early 21st Century, the republic was affected by the instability afflicting other parts of the region and the spill-over from the conflict in nearby Chechnya. 
Most of the republic's newspapers are state-owned. There are three local TV services in Nalchik, which broadcast via federal networks.
Key events in the modern history of Kabardino-Balkaria:
17th-19th Centuries - The area is contested by the Russian and Ottoman empires, until it finally comes under Russian control. 
1921 - Following the Bolshevik revolution, the Kabardino Autonomous Region is formed, with the Balkar district added a year later. 
1936 - The region becomes an autonomous republic within the USSR.
1944 - Accused by Stalin of collaboration with the Nazis, the Balkars are deported to Central Asia during World War Two and their name is dropped from the republic's title. 
1957 - Under Khrushchev, the Balkars are allowed to return from exile and their name is restored to the republic's title.
1991 - The region becomes a federal republic of Russia following the collapse of the USSR.
2000s onwards - An Islamist insurgency in North Caucus breaks out between Russia and militants associated with the Caucasus Emirate and, from 2015, Islamic State groups. Incidents are mostly concentrated in the North Caucasus republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.

2005 - Militants stage a large-scale, armed assault on government buildings in Nalchik. Russia deploys hundreds of troops and special forces with orders to shoot to kill. Many dozens are reported dead, including militants, civilians and Russian forces.
Yarmuk, a local militant Islamic group with Chechen links, says its fighters had been involved as part of a Caucasus Front. The Caucasus Front against Russia was decreed in May 2005 by the late Chechen rebel leader Abdul-Khalim Saydullayev, in a bid further to widen Chechnya's conflict with Russia.
2010 - The region's top Muslim cleric is shot dead, in an attack blamed on militants.
2011 - Suspected Islamists attacked ski resorts in what Russia sees as preparations for assaults on the 2014 Winter Olympics in nearby Sochi.

Karachay-Cherkessia profile,"The Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia lies in the northwest of Russia's North Caucasus region.
The Karachay and Cherkess are two separate Muslim peoples. The Cherkess are ethnically and culturally related to the Kabarda and Adygey peoples and the Karachay to the Balkars. 
The republic is also home to Abazin and Nogay minorities. Ethnic tensions flare sporadically. 
Although it has not experienced the levels of violence seen elsewhere in the North Caucasus, the republic lives in the shadow of the troubles which have plagued the region. 
Russian forces have mounted numerous security operations and reported foiling intended attacks by Islamist militants. 
The region is economically poor. 
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, almost all independent media have been banned, blocked or declared ""foreign agents"" or ""undesirable organisations"", says the NGO Reporters Without Borders (RSF). All others are subject to military censorship.
Key events in the modern history of Karachay-Cherkessia:
19th Century - The region is absorbed into the expanding Russian Empire. 
1922 - The USSR carries out divide-and-rule tactics to weaken resistance to Soviet rule by splitting related groups and joining unrelated ones in shared administrative units. As part of this pattern, the Karachay-Cherkessia autonomous region is first created.
1926 - The region is divided into Karachay and Cherkess halves.
1943 - The Karachay autonomous region is abolished, the Karachay people are accused of collaborating with the invading Nazis and subsequently deported to Central Asia. Of almost 80,000 people deported, over 43,000 die.
1957 - After Stalin's death, Khruschev allows the Karachay to return, and the Karachay-Cherkess autonomous region is recreated. 
1992 - Karachay-Cherkessia gains republic status following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Soviet-era Communist leader Vladimir Khubiyev is re-appointed as president by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
1999 - The republic's first direct presidential elections. Vladimir Semyonov, a Karachay and former commander of Russian ground forces, defeats Stanislav Derev, a Cherkess businessman. The vote is followed by furious protests and allegations of fraud. 
2004 - Seven businessmen are killed in controversial circumstances. The former son-in-law of then President Mustafa Batdyyev is later convicted of organizing the murders. 
2007 - Russia's FSB security service kills Rustam Ionov, also known as Abu-Bakar, the head of the Karachaevo Jamaat or assembly, along with his wife.
2022 - Russian senator Rauf Arashukov and his father Raul - a local Gazprom official - are given life sentences for the 2010 killings of Fral Shebzukhov, an adviser to the then-president of Karachay-Cherkessia, and youth movement activist Aslan Zhukov. Investigators say the Arashukovs were part of an organized crime network in the republic.

Chris Parry: Parents of killed aid worker arrive in Ukraine,"The family of a man killed in Ukraine as he helped to rescue civilians has arrived in the country to deliver aid.
Chris Parry, 28, from Truro, died alongside fellow volunteer Andrew Bagshaw in January.
Mr Parry's mother, father and sister crossed the border into Ukraine earlier after setting off in an aid convoy from Cornwall on Saturday.
The group is delivering aid to help with humanitarian work in the country, invaded by Russia in February 2022.
The family is in a four-vehicle convoy of volunteers from the group Driving Ukraine, which is carrying medical supplies and generators to Ukraine.
Their destination is Lviv in the west of Ukraine, where the vehicles will be handed over to aid workers.
Mr Parry's mother Christine told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""Driving into Poland yesterday I did feel quite emotional because I thought 'am I literally following the footsteps of Chris?'
""I'm constantly thinking of him and what it was like for him at the start of the war.
""It must have been complete chaos.""
She added: ""The journey has been incredible, a complete and utter whirlwind.
""It's full-on, we have been driving for two full days now.""
Mr Parry and Mr Bagshaw were believed to be attempting to rescue a woman in Soledar when their car was hit by an artillery shell.
Mr Parry had spent months rescuing people trapped on the front line and bringing them to safety.
His father Rob made a visit to Ukraine at the end of July and has returned with his wife and their daughter, Kate.

Hello and welcome to our live stream of the opening of a newly-found
time capsule which has been lost for nearly 200 years.
The lead box was found at the West Point military academy in
the US during recent renovations.
It dates back to the 1820s, when future Confederate general Robert E. Lee was a graduate at the academy.
What is inside is a mystery, so watch along as we find out.

Palestinian fears grow amid rising Israeli settler attacks,"There's been a dramatic rise in violence carried out by extremist Israeli settlers against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank this year, with more than 100 incidents reported a month according to the UN. It warns that some 400 people have been driven from their land since the start of 2022.
Smashed cars and homes and shops set ablaze. Recent months have seen some of the worst ever scenes of settler violence in the occupied West Bank.
Some have turned deadly.
Posters in remembrance of 19-year-old Qusai Maatan, showing him astride his white Arabian horse, now surround a small roundabout in the village of Burqa, set among olive trees in the rolling hills north-east of Ramallah. 
""He had a deeply caring nature. He'd always greet me warmly and check on me in a thoughtful way,"" says his grandfather, Abdul Moneim Maatan, his voice cracking. ""His absence leaves a huge void.""
On the evening Qusai was shot dead by an armed settler, his family say he had gone for a picnic with friends at the edge of the village. Locals describe how a confrontation with radical Israelis living nearby escalated quickly. Stones were thrown and at least one settler opened fire. In an unusually strong rebuke, Israel's closest ally, the US, described what happened here as ""Jewish terrorism"".
Two Israeli settlers and at least five Palestinians were arrested by Israeli security forces, who say they are still investigating the incident.
Settler attacks have become more common, says a young relative of Qusai, who is afraid to give her name.
""No-one knows who the next Qusai is going to be,"" she adds. ""No-one is going to protect us. If, God forbid, there are any other confrontations or attacks, our government can't legally do anything.""
While the Palestinian Authority (PA) governs in big Palestinian cities, Israel retains near exclusive control of 60% of the West Bank (known as Area C), presiding over law enforcement, planning and construction. An estimated 370,000 Palestinians live in Area C, which includes Burqa, and half a million Israeli citizens. Israel's new government, its most right-wing and nationalist to date, has openly declared its intention to double the number of settlers to one million.
Most of the world sees settlements as illegal under international law, though Israel disagrees. 
Already 2023 has set an all-time record for settlement construction in the West Bank and for the legitimisation of outposts, according to settlement watchdog Peace Now. Outposts are often set up with a wink and a nod from Israeli authorities but without official permission.
In recent months, the Israeli government - which includes long-time settler activists in key cabinet posts - has completed or begun to legalise 15 settler outposts that were previously illegal under Israeli law, Peace Now says.
What looks like an official signpost leads me to the settler outpost of Oz Zion in an olive grove on a hilltop above Burqa. It was built on privately owned, officially registered land belonging to Palestinians in the village. There is a collection of white, prefabricated buildings, a rudimentary play area for the young children of six families which I am told now live here, and a pen of sheep.
""Our vision is that all of the land of Israel will be settled with Jews. It's our basic right. Our right is in the Bible,"" says Yehuda Lieber, a 26-year-old father of two. He is encouraged by the fact that some of those in government share his ideology and believes that eventually Israel will retroactively authorise his outpost.
""We have an expectation from the government that was elected by right-wing votes to settle the land, expand the settlements, and not hurt them,"" he says. 
With a series of new outposts recently set up, he tells me the settlers' strategy is to block Palestinian statehood. Creating an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, is a long-time goal of the internationally backed two-state solution to end the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict.
""What we're doing here and in other places that exist is to halt the establishment of the Palestinian state, which is being built in practice without asking anyone,"" Mr Lieber says.  
Anti-occupation groups argue that as settlers have become emboldened by the current Israeli coalition government, settler attacks on Palestinians and their property have risen to a record high. The trend comes against the background of a surge in tensions in the West Bank this year, with near-nightly Israeli military raids and a spate of Palestinian assaults.   
It has been the deadliest year for Palestinians and Israelis here for nearly two decades. More than 180 Palestinians have been killed in the territory - mostly fighters, but also many civilians, according to figures collated from PA sources. On the Israeli side, some 32 people have been killed, nearly all civilians - about half in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem.
Some deadly Palestinian militant attacks have led to violent rampages carried out in revenge by settlers, as seen in Huwara in February, following the shooting of two brothers from a nearby settlement, and Turmus Ayya in June, after four settlers were killed outside a petrol station. Both of those assaults left a Palestinian dead. The top Israeli military spokesman recently commented that the spike in settler attacks, which he called ""nationalist terrorism"", was in turn driving Palestinians to attack Israelis. 
Official figures from Israel's internal security agency registered a 15% increase in individual Palestinian attacks on civilians and soldiers across Israel and the Occupied Territories in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period last year. In 2022, the agency counted 1,317 uses of fire or pipe bombs, shootings, arson, and stabbings compared to 1,522 in 2023.
Israeli security forces have come under increased scrutiny with the rise in settler violence. They are often criticised for failing to intervene effectively and sometimes for apparently supporting acts of harassment.
The UN's humanitarian agency (OCHA) says it has registered over 700 incidents this year where settler violence has resulted in Palestinian casualties, damage to property or both. The number is the highest since it began recording such acts in 2006.
""Just to give you an idea, in 2021 there was an average of one incident of settler violence a day that we were recording. In 2022, there were two incidents of settler violence and in 2023 we have an average of three incidents of settler violence a day,"" says Andrea De Domenico, head of OCHA in the occupied Palestinian territory.
Mr de Domenico warns that Palestinian Bedouin and other herding communities in Area C are particularly vulnerable.
""We're seeing more and more pressure on Palestinian communities to leave their land,"" he tells me. ""Recently there are three communities that have been completely removed.""
At the start of August, the remaining families from al-Qabun, a herding community in the central West Bank, dismantled their homes and sheep pens to move to safer places. A total of 89 people were forced away, blaming Israeli demolition threats and settler intimidation.
""They used to stop outside our house at midnight and honk their car horns or send kids to harass us. They would scare the sheep and block them in, or empty out our water tank,"" says Ammar Abu Alia. 
He worries for the future as he squeezes more than 100 of his flock into a pen on land which he is only able to rent temporarily. ""What will we do?"" he asks. ""We'll be forced to sell. We'll have no livelihood.""
Like the rest of her extended family, Nida Abu Alia - Ammar's sister - is now living in cramped accommodation in a village close to the land they lived on for generations. The mother of nine is bitter about the relative lack of attention paid to her community's plight.
""People said that this is Area C, but that's not right. It's the land of Palestine,"" she says. ""Our displacement is a great loss. People must realise what's happening. If they don't, we will lose a lot.""
Human rights groups warn that the forced transfer of Palestinians from their homes on occupied land could amount to a war crime by Israel, if it is proven that official steps amount to coercion.
At the same time, settlers and their supporters in the Israeli government are seeking to take advantage of the new political reality. Huge investment is planned to expand settlements and improve their infrastructure, cementing a Jewish presence in the West Bank and changing the landscape.
With their own leaders too weak to effect a serious change in course and a sense that settlers enjoy impunity, Palestinian anger and resentment is growing. 
The ongoing developments only look set to deepen bitter hostilities.

Faroe Islands profile,"The Faroes, an archipelago of 18 islands in the North Atlantic, are a self-governing nation under the external sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark.
While the islands' rugged coastlines and extensive bird life are a draw for some, the Faroes also offer the prospect of major offshore reserves of oil and gas. 
These potential resources have given extra weight to the argument for full independence from Denmark. But a planned referendum on the issue was shelved in 2001 after Denmark said it would halt aid within four years if voters favoured the independence proposals. 
At present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
A local parliament - the Loegting - looks after the islands' affairs, although Copenhagen is responsible for defence and foreign relations.  The Faroe Islands are not part of the European Union.
Queen: Margrethe II of Denmark
Prime minister: Bardur a Steig Nielsen
Bardur a Steig Nielsen became prime minister in September 2019, leading a coalition government between the Union Party, People's Party, and Centre Party.
There are two national dailies in the Faroe Islands. The main national radio and TV services are publicly-funded.
There were 48,400 internet users by July 2022, comprising 98% of the population, while Facebook is the leading social media site with 47,000 users (Worldinternetstats.com).
The Faroes were first settled by Irish monks in the 6th century AD. The first Norse settlers were farmers. 
The islands became part of the Kingdom of Norway in the 11th Century and came under Danish control in the 14th Century when Norway joined the Kingdom of Denmark. Under the 1948 Home Rule Act the islands became self-governing. 
The islanders' traditional hunt for pilot whales has attracted international attention. Supporters of the hunt say whale meat is an important source of food over the winter. Animal rights activists have called for the cull to be banned. 
Fishing is the main economic activity on the islands, and Danish subsidies remain an important source of income. Copenhagen has said it will review the subsidy agreement should the Faroes profit from offshore energy reserves. 
Some key dates in the Faroe Islands' history: 
circa 600 AD - Irish monks settle on the islands.
circa 800 - Norwegian farmers arrive. 
circa 1000 - Christianity introduced under the king of Norway's rule.
1035 - Islands become part of the Kingdom of Norway.
1380 - Along with Norway, the Faroe Islands become part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
1655 - Faroe Islands are presented to the von Gabel family. Their oppressive feudal rule ends in 1709 when the Faroes come under direct Danish rule.
1816 - Faroe Islands become a Danish county.
1849 - Under the Danish constitution the Faroes are given representation in both houses of the Danish parliament.
1856 - Danish trade monopoly ends.
1872 - Purchase of the first seafaring fishing vessel heralds the growth of the islands' main economic activity.
1906-09 - First political parties are formed, representing divisions over home-rule issue.
1940 - World War Two: British forces occupy the Faroes while Denmark is under German occupation.
1946 - Narrow vote for secession from Denmark in referendum. Danish king dissolves Faroese parliament.
1948 - Home rule act is passed. The islands become an autonomous, self-governing region of the Kingdom of Denmark.
1973 - Territory opts not to join the European Community with Denmark.
2001 - Planned referendum on independence is cancelled after Denmark says a pro-independence result would lead to a halt in annual subsidies.
2006 - The islands start importing whalemeat from Iceland, despite a UN ban on the trade
2022 - Faroe Islands agrees to provisionally limit its controversial dolphin hunt to 500 animals, after receiving widespread criticism over 2021's cull, where more than 1,400 were killed.

Greenland profile,"Greenland is the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish dependent territory with self-government and its own parliament.
Though a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe - in particular the two colonial powers, Norway and Denmark - since the 9th Century.
Denmark contributes two-thirds of Greenland's budget revenue, the rest coming mainly from fishing. Potential oil, gas and rare earth mineral reserves have attracted prospecting firms. 
Greenland enjoys perpetual daylight for two months each year. Over 80% of the island is covered by a permanent ice cap 4km thick in places. Global warming is causing this to melt but has also increased access to Greenland's mineral resources. 
The US has long seen Greenland as strategically important and established a radar base at Thule at the start of the Cold War. 
Head of State: Queen Margrethe II of Denmark
Prime Minister of Greenland: Mute Bourup Egede
Mr Egede took over in April 2021 after his left-wing Inuit Ataqatigiit party won parliamentary elections on a platform of halting a rare metals mining project on environmental grounds.
Disagreement over the project led to the collapse of the previous government earlier in the year, paving the way for snap elections.
Broadcasting in Greenlandic and Danish is the main source of news and entertainment.
There are no daily newspapers. The major titles - a weekly and a bi-weekly - publish in Greenlandic and Danish. 
Some key dates in Greenland's history:
982 - Greenland discovered by the Norwegian, Erik the Red, who calls his discovery ""Greenland"" to make it more attractive. In 986 he returns with settlers.
14th-15th Centuries -  Norse settlements disappear, perhaps at the onset of the Little Ice Age as temperatures fall significantly.
1721 - An expedition led by Danish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede sees new Danish colonisation. A new settlement is established near present-day capital, Nuuk.
1940 - Denmark is occupied by Germany during World War Two. 
1941-1945 - United States occupies Greenland to defend it against a possible invasion by Germany.
1950 - Denmark agrees to allow the US to regain the use of Thule Air Base which is greatly expanded between 1951 and 1953 as part of a Nato Cold War defence strategy. 
1953 - Greenland becomes an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
1968  - A USAF B-52 bomber carrying nuclear weapons crashes near Thule.  Decades later, a BBC report says that despite earlier US claims to the contrary, searchers were only able to locate three of the four hydrogen bombs.
1979 - Greenland attains home rule following a referendum. 
1985 - Greenland leaves the European Economic Community (EEC) over disagreement with EEC commercial fishing regulations and an EEC ban on seal skin products.
1999 - Danish High Court rules that Inuit were illegally exiled from their land in northern Greenland in 1953 to expand US airbase at Thule but denies them right of return.
2008 - Greenlanders vote in referendum for more autonomy, greater control over energy resources and granting Kalaallisut or Western Greenlandic status of official language in place of Danish.
2010 - Greenland's ice sheet is shrinking faster and making a bigger contribution to rising sea levels, a study in the journal Science confirms.
2013 - Greenland ends the territory's 25-year ban on the mining of radioactive materials such as uranium, leading to a boom in mineral resource exports.
2021 - Greenland bans all new oil and gas exploration in its territory. Government officials say the environmental ""price of oil extraction is too high"".
Rain falls on the summit of Greenland's ice cap for the first time in recorded history, which scientists attribute to climate change

Czech Republic country profile,"Part of Czechoslovakia until the ""velvet divorce"" in January 1993, the Czech Republic or Czechia, has a robust democratic tradition, a highly-developed economy and a rich cultural heritage.
It emerged from over 40 years of Communist rule in 1990, and was the first former Eastern Bloc state to acquire the status of a developed economy. It joined the European Union in 2004.
Communist rule had lasted since 1948, when the restored pre-war democratic system was overthrown in a Soviet-backed coup. The ""Prague Spring"" of 1968, when Communist leader Alexander Dubcek tried to bring in liberal reforms, was crushed by Warsaw Pact tanks.
In 1989, as the curtain was coming down on communism in the Kremlin, the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel emerged as the figurehead of the country's ""velvet revolution"" and became the first president of post-communist Czechoslovakia.
President-elect: Petr Pavel 
Retired Nato general Petr Pavel has won the January 2023 presidential election after seeing off his populist challenger Andrej Babis. The ex-general will replace Milos Zeman, whose second term ends in March. 
Mr Pavel has backed keeping the Czech Republic anchored in the European Union and Nato and has come out strongly in favour of further military aid for Ukraine to fight against Russia's invasion.
In the Czech Republic, the role of president is a mostly ceremonial but still influential post. The presidents choose prime ministers and central bank bosses, as well as having a say in foreign policy. 
Prime minister: Petr Fiala
The populist ANO party suffered a surprise defeat at the October 2021 elections, after four years in power, at the hands of the centre-right Spolu coalition led by Petr Fiala.
The poor health of President Zeman delayed the appointment of the new government until the end of November. 
ANO leader Andrej Babis's time in office was overshadowed by fraud allegations, the collapse of a major energy provider, and public criticism of his response to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Private radio and TV stations provide stiff competition for their public rivals.
Public broadcaster Ceska Televize runs several networks, including a 24-hour news channel. 
Media freedom organisations have raised concerns about the concentration of media ownership.

Czech Republic media guide,"A lively commercial broadcasting sector provides stiff competition for public service outlets.
Public Ceska Televize (CT) operates several networks, including 24-hour news channel CT24. Public radio, Cesky Rozhlas (CRo), runs national and local stations.
The leading private TV channels Nova and Prima broadcast nationally. There are scores of privately-owned radio stations, including Impuls and Frekvence 1. 
The media operate relatively freely and without undue government curbs, says Freedom House.
But in recent years, the country has experienced several corruption scandals and political disputes that have hampered normal legislative activity. Illiberal rhetoric is increasingly visible, says the civil liberties group.
Freedom House also says there are concerns about the concentration of media ownership among wealthy business figures and the ""potential impact of this on journalists' ability to investigate commercial interests"".
There were 9.3 million internet users by July 2022, comprising some 87% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com). Facebook is the leading social media platform.

'Stolen' totem pole prepared for return to Canada,"This video can not be played
The totem pole is being carefully prepared for a 4,200-mile journey.
On the ground floor of the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, one of its biggest displays is being carefully prepared for a 4,200-mile journey to its original home.
A 36ft (11m), one-tonne totem pole will be returned to the Nisga'a Nation, one of the indigenous groups in what is now known as British Columbia on the west coast of Canada.
The totem pole has been in Scotland for almost a century since it was sold to the museum by Canadian anthropologist Marius Barbeau.
However, Nisga'a researchers say it was stolen without consent while locals were away from their villages for the annual hunting season.
The museum believes it acted in good faith but now understands that the individual who ""sold"" it to Barbeau did so ""without the cultural, spiritual, or political authority to do so on behalf of the Nisga'a Nation"". 
Last year it was agreed that the pole should be returned.
The totem pole was carved from red cedar in 1855 and is made almost entirely from a single piece of wood, with a small cap on top which can be separated
It originally stood in Ank'idaa village on the banks of the Nass River before it arrived in Scotland in 1929.
The totem, which features carved animals, human figures and family crests, tells the story of a Nisga'a warrior who was next in line to become chief before his death.
Dr Amy Parent, who is the Canada research chair in indigenous education and governance at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, has led the move to return the pole.
Dr Parent, who has the Nisga'a cultural name Noxs Ts'aawit, said: ""Within the pole itself we have crests that are carved - often represented by animals or humans - and within our particular pole there are two carved ravens as well as some other animals and then the chief sitting at the top.
""The ravens themselves represent the name Ts'aawit. He was an ancestral relative who passed away. He had lost his life defending our nation. He was a warrior and part of my name is attached to the name Ts'aawit.""
On Monday, a group of Nisga'a people, including Noxs Ts'aawit (Dr Parent), carried out a private spiritual ceremony in front of the pole in Edinburgh before scaffolding is erected and it is encased in a protective cradle for its epic move. 
Over the next month it will be manoeuvred out of a museum window and then flown across the Atlantic by the Royal Canadian Air Force.
For the museum it is a painstaking operation.
Dr John Giblin, keeper of global arts culture and design at the National Museum of Scotland, said: ""To prepare the pole to be able to leave the building we first needed to clear out entire galleries.
""We need to construct a scaffold around the pole, a cradle to have it lowered very carefully and it needs to be moved through the building.
""We need to close a road then it will be moved off to an air base.""
It's the first time a national museum in the UK has returned a belonging of this type.
""I'm really pleased that the pole will be returning to its home where its spiritual, cultural, historical significance is most keenly felt,"" Dr Giblin said.
The memorial totem is due to arrive in British Columbia in late September and will then be driven to the Nass Valley where it will be showcased in a Nisga'a museum with more than 300 objects that have been returned from around the world.
Noxs Ts'aawit said: ""We are starting to feel really excited. Our hearts are at peace knowing we are doing the right thing and that we are re-establishing a new relationship with Scotland and with the museum.
""We are also in some ways still grieving and recognising that we have had many generations of family members, especially our matriarchs and our chiefs, many of whom have wanted to bring this pole home and we're not able to within their lifetimes.
""We are recognising that these people in our family won't be present, unfortunately they have passed away into the spirit world, and they have many children and others who will be feeling that grief. 
""At the same time we're feeling very uplifted and feeling like this is going to be a very historic moment for our nation and for Scotland.""

Imaan Mazari-Hazir: Lawyer who called Pakistan army 'terrorists' re-arrested,"A prominent Pakistani human rights lawyer who criticised the powerful military has been re-arrested hours after a court granted her bail.
Imaan Mazari-Hazir was due for release on Monday night until she was detained on a second terrorism charge.
She was placed in custody a week ago, prompting widespread criticism.
Analysts say a crackdown has increased after military installations were attacked in May by crowds protesting at the arrest of former PM Imran Khan.
""There has been a gross over-reaction to the events of 9 May. But the establishment doesn't want to be seen as only focused against Mr Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf [PTI] party. So, now they are targeting different segments of the society,"" prominent journalist Cyril Almeida told the BBC.
The basis for the second charge against Ms Mazari-Hazir was not immediately clear. Video footage shows her being arrested outside Adiala jail in Islamabad, where she has been held on judicial remand.
Her lawyer, Zainab Januja, said police had provided neither a copy of the charges against her nor an arrest warrant. 
""They only informed us that there is another case against her at a different police station,"" she told the BBC. ""The police will present her in court within 24 hours to get remand. We do not know why and in which case she has been arrested now.""
A number of PTI members have also been re-arrested after posting bail in recent weeks. 
Ms Mazari-Hazir was detained two days after a rally organised by the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) rights group  in Islamabad on 18 August. Videos widely shared on social media show her making a speech in which she strongly criticises the military for alleged abductions, a charge the army has always denied.
""You are being stopped, as if you are terrorists while the real terrorists are sitting in GHQ [Pakistan's military headquarters],"" she told the rally.
Moments before she was first taken into custody, Ms Mazari-Hazir posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) that ""unknown persons"" were breaking down the security cameras in her home and that the gate to her house was ""jumped over"".
Her mother, Shireen Mazari, alleged that security officials disregarded arrest warrants and legal procedures.
Ms Mazari, who served as the country's human rights minister under Imran Khan, posted on X that the police had barged in, ransacked her daughter's room, confiscated her phone and laptop, and forcibly took her away. 
""They did not even let her change out of her night clothes,"" she told the BBC the next day. 
Ali Wazir, co-founder of the PTM rights group and a former lawmaker, was also detained by police in Islamabad. 
The two were later presented in an anti-terrorism court on charges of sedition and terrorism. Police have accused them of propagating anti-state messages.
Just before her transfer to prison, Ms Mazari-Hazir rushed to her visibly distressed mother and gave her a long hug. 
Murtaza Solangi, the federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting, told the BBC that Ms Mazari-Hazir's speech was a ""condemnable act"". 
""I can't even imagine the result of such speeches. Pakistan is a nuclear state. How can someone say that the commander or chief of the army, sitting in the Headquarters is involved in terrorism?""
But many observers perceive these arrests as part of a larger effort to suppress voices critical of the military. 
Human Rights Watch, in a statement last Thursday, labelled the arrests as an attempt to ""suppress dissent, emphasizing the importance of upholding due process"".
""In arresting Imaan Mazari and others, Pakistani authorities are using vague, overboard anti-terrorism laws to stifle dissent. The government should uphold the right to due process,"" the statement added. 
Social media users also reacted strongly.
Nida Kirmani, a sociology professor and human rights activist, was among those who spoke out against the ""harsh"" arrests.
She said both Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Wazir had been ""unfairly targeted for exercising their freedom of speech"".
""Sadly, I am not shocked,"" she told the BBC, referring to Ms Mazar's re-arrest just after being granted bail. 
""The security state is hyper-paranoid and insecure at the moment, which is increasing their capacity for human rights abuses as well. The tolerance for dissent was already low, but at the moment, it is non-existent.""
Mr Almeida says the situation in Pakistan now is ""just as bad as some of the worst times"". 
Like many others, he thinks that tactics used to supress dissent in areas like Balochistan province and formerly federally administered tribal regions are now being applied ""more centrally"".
The increasing crackdowns coincide with a period in which Pakistan is being governed by a caretaker government widely perceived to have strong affiliations with the military establishment.
The last two years in Pakistan have been full of great political turmoil, economic instability and rising security concerns. 
Amidst all these crises, people were looking forward to a new election to bring some stability. 
But the polls, which were due to take place this autumn, are now likely to be postponed, leaving many concerned about Pakistan's democratic future.
Is Imran Khan's political future over now he is in jail?

Denmark media guide,"The internet is the media platform most used by Danes. Audiences for linear TV broadcasting and print media are declining.
Public broadcaster DR runs national TV networks and national and regional radio stations. 
In 2018, the then centre-right government cut DR's budget by 20% and moved to phase out the licence fee which provides much of the broadcaster's funding.
DR responded by announcing plans to cut or streamline some of its services.
TV 2, a government-owned national commercial broadcaster, operates regional outlets and is available by subscription.
Private TVs broadcast via digital terrestrial, satellite and cable platforms. Swedish, American and German companies are major players in broadcasting.

Denmark country profile,"The Kingdom of Denmark has, despite its relatively small size, punched above its weight internationally.
Vikings raiding from Denmark and the other Nordic nations changed the course of 9th and 10th Century European history; in the Middle Ages, the Union of Kalmar united all of Scandinavia under Danish leadership.
In more recent times, Denmark has developed a highly-competitive service-based economy with high employment levels and a generous social security system.
The Social Democrats led coalition governments for most of the post-war period until the 1980s, consolidating the country's liberal reputation, although concerns at high taxation levels and tension over immigration have put the centre-right in office for several long periods since then. 
Queen: Margrethe II
Queen Margrethe became monarch only because a change in the law in 1953 allowed a woman to ascend to the throne. She succeeded on the death of her father, King Frederick IX, in 1972.
The queen is a skilled artist, clothes designer and translator. She speaks English, French and German, in addition to her native Danish, and her work as an illustrator has been widely published. Prince Henrik died in 2018.
Prime Minister: Mette Frederiksen
Social Democrat leader Mette Frederiksen led her party back to power in the June 2019 general election, ending four years of centre-right rule.
She campaigned on a combination of traditional centre-left calls for stronger welfare policies, combined with a promise to be tough on immigration. 
She took over the party leadership in 2015, when her predecessor and Denmark's first woman prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, lost power.
Taking office at the age of 41, she is the youngest prime minister in Danish history.
Public Danmarks Radio (DR) runs national TV networks and national and regional radio.
TV2 is a government-owned commercial station. The main privately-owned TVs broadcast via digital terrestrial, satellite and cable.

Notting Hill Carnival: Storytelling at heart of Mas,"""Playing Mas isn't just about dressing in costumes, it's about telling a story.""
That's according to Symone Williams, the artistic director of the Genesis Mas Band, which has been parading at Notting Hill Carnival since the 1980s.
The band was established by her father Vernon ""Fellows"" Williams, who was also a founding member of the carnival itself in the 1960s.
Ms Williams, along with her family, are continuing his work of keeping the Mas stories and traditions alive for future generations. 
Mas, an abbreviation of masquerade, has its origins in the Caribbean, in particular to the emancipation of black slaves in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1800s, Ms Williams said. 
""'Playing mas' means to play in costumes,"" she explains. ""Costumes were used to tell a story of what was going on at the time and that all started in Trinidad.
""Whatever was preserved was kept as a traditional element of ritualistic of storytelling through masquerade, masks and costumes.""
Ms Williams added: ""They were sort of like newspapers, in costume form.""
Notting Hill Carnival is seen by many as a street party, but Ms Williams wants more people to recognise the history behind the costume, as well as the modern day struggles represented in their art. 
Ms Williams said: ""Traditionally, costumes were used to tell a story, they were used to resist, they were used to unify and empower.""
An example of the event's links links to the Caribbean are the characters portrayed at the carnival. 
One of these characters was the ""fancy drunken sailor"", Ms Williams said. ""That tells the history of when the US occupied Trinidad and how all of the American sailors used to come and take over.
""What Caribbean people tend to do is turn things around and mock and make something light hearted or something serious.""
Mas was introduced to the UK in the 1960s when Trinidadian Mas camps became popular with the diaspora community seeking a flavour of home. 
Mas camps are when designers come together to create their costumes in the months and weeks before a carnival. Approximately 15,000 bejewelled, feathered costumes are made each year, according to a Notting Hill archive piece.
It formed a foundational element to what has become the biggest street carnival in Europe. 
The artform has developed beyond its Trinidadian origins with influences from other Afro-Caribbean cultures and those of Latin America.
""I've seen the development of more skimpy fashionista-style, and very beautified costumes where they're very pretty, and really well made and very elaborate and a lot of feathers. The influence of that is from Brazil,"" Ms Williams said. 
She said she finds it difficult to strike the right balance between incorporating traditional elements with current trends. 
""I want to hold onto the tradition but also keep it modernised,"" Ms Williams said. 
Ms Williams is the executive producer of a documentary on Masquerade and its place within the carnival to help expose the tradition behind the costumes to more people. 
""As well as showcasing the people who make these costumes, Mas Resistance will also show the artistic element of why we do it, and where the history of costumes come from, why they exist.""
She said this year's theme is about empowerment and freedom. 
""Women are empowered by wearing what they want at carnival and I think the message is that we're not whispery, we're not inhibited. It's an empowerment tool, especially for women,"" Ms Williams said.

Children have right to clean environment - report,"Children have the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and governments must urgently act to ensure this, the United Nations says.
In a new report, the UN Child Rights Committee says that climate change is affecting children's rights to life, survival and development.
It says young children are among the most vulnerable, yet their voices are rarely heard in climate change debates.
Tuesday's report outlines new guidance for governments to follow.
Drawn up with the help of young people, it includes phasing out fossil fuels and switching to renewable energy.
UN countries will also be required to take measures to protect children from the harmful effects of climate change, such as monitoring air quality, regulating food safety and tackling emissions and toxic lead exposure.
Countries should also address the ""clear emerging link"" between climate change and children's mental health, identifying eco-anxiety and depression as conditions that are on the rise.
And the UN says that young people must be included when drawing up new guidance.
Governments are responsible not just for protecting children from immediate harm, the report says, but from the future effects of climate change. They can be held accountable for environmental damage both inside their own borders and beyond them.
The report was compiled following two rounds of consultations with participating countries, national human rights institutions, international bodies, experts, and an advisory committee made up of 12 young climate change advisors.
The committee received 16,331 contributions from children in 121 nations, who shared the effects of environmental degradation and climate change on their lives and communities.
Ann Skelton, who leads the committee said in a statement that the guidelines could have ""great and far-reaching legal significance"" because it makes clear the obligations governments have to protect children from environmental harms.
""Children are architects, leaders, thinkers and changemakers of today's world. Our voices matter, and they deserve to be listened to,"" said 17-year-old Kartik, a climate and child rights activist from India and one of the committee's child advisers.
Scientists and politicians say we are facing a planetary crisis because of climate change, and scientists say that there is no doubt that the particularly rapid climate change seen over the past century is caused by humans.
Impacts so far include:

All times stated are UK
We're still waiting to hear from the Spanish FA (RFEF) which has been holding its ""extraordinary and urgent"" meeting to discuss the crisis over its president Luis Rubiales, who sparked a huge row when he kissed midfielder Jenni Hermoso on the lips after Spain won the Women’s World Cup.
What's happened so far today?:
We're pausing our live updates for now - but we'll be back if there are big developments later.
On 20 August, Spanish fans were revelling in the success of their national women's team, who had just won their first World Cup. Today, the headlines couldn't be more different. Here's a brief timeline of how we got here...
Sunday 20 August - World Cup final

England midfielder Georgia Stanway says the Lionesses have all wanted to show their ""love and support"" for the Spanish women's side.
This morning she spoke to BBC Breakfast about the reasons why the England team put out a statement saying they stood by Jenni Hermoso.
In their statement, the Lionesses jointly condemned the ""unacceptable actions
allowed to happen by a sexist and patriarchal organisation"".
Stanway wants the Spanish football federation ""to do what's right"" and for the Spanish team's World Cup victory to return as the main focus.
Victor Francos, the president of the Spanish Sports Council, has just been speaking to reporters. 
He says he's still waiting for the outcome of the meeting of the Spanish FA (Rfef), which is in talks over what steps, if any, to take in the case of Luis Rubiales.
He hasn't spoken to any FA members, saying it's only fair to wait, and respect the discussions.
Asked about people at Friday's RFEF meeting, where Rubiales was applauded by some as he refused to resign, Francos said ""I really didn't like the applause"".
He also expressed concern about impact of the controversy on the way Spanish football is seen.
Spain's Football Federation has been meeting this afternoon to discuss what happens next with Rubiales.
Outside the building, the president of the Las Palmas Football Federation Juan Jose Arencibia spoke to the media, and said he had expected Rubiales to resign on Friday.
""I came to the last meeting thinking that he would resign and it was clear to me that in this kind of issue, the values and the morals are above everything else, despite the fact that he's a good guy,""  Arencibia said.
""I couldn´t be flexible with this,"" he added, and said the Federation ""needs to take action"".
Paco Diez, the Madrid Football Federation president also stopped for a word to journalists, and said ""things need to change radically"".
We're still waiting for news on the outcome of the meeting - stay with us.
Spanish football journalist Danae Boronat has just been speaking to the BBC about how the incident is being talked about in Spain.
She says the controversial kiss has overshadowed what would otherwise be victory celebrations.
""It is a shame, but the truth is we are not talking about the winning of the World Cup,"" Boronat says.
At the last World Cup, it was ""unthinkable to dream of winning,"" she says, but now ""no time has been dedicated to the sporting success of this team"".
Guillem Balague
Spanish football expert
This is the Spanish MeToo moment.
It's an opportunity to focus everybody's attention on the treatment of women in football - and on the frustration at what many see as systemic blindness at the top of an elite organisation, the Spanish football federation (RFEF).
Jenni Hermoso is being backed not just by female players, but male players too - although perhaps not as much as hoped. 
It's caused a storm in football, which has turned into a social tsunami. It feels like wherever you are, everyone is talking about it, and in Spain it's the number one story every day. 
One week ago, we were celebrating a historic World Cup victory. That has quickly soured, some say. It's been a whirlwind of success and recrimination, of holding to account - and of sheer defiance.
But there is one thing people on every side agree on: this is one of the most important weeks for Spain in living memory.
Read the full article here.
Guy Hedgecoe
Reporting from Madrid
While
outside the HQ of the national sports tribunal (TAD), which is meeting to
discuss possible proceedings against Luis Rubiales, three separate motorists - all male - shouted abuse aimed at the suspended president in the space of half
an hour. 
It's not a scientific survey, by any means, but it does seem to
reflect how strongly many Spaniards feel about this issue.
And it also shows how conspicuous
support for Luis Rubiales is, by its absence.
New to this story? We’ve made a video summing up the controversy, what Jenni Hermoso and Luis Rubiales have said, and how Spanish players are reacting.
Get up to speed in just over a minute:
We've been hearing today from Yolanda Diaz, who is Spain's labour minister and also the second deputy prime minister.
Reuters is reporting her comments that male chauvinism is ""systemic"" in the country.
Following the meeting of the Spanish FA, Rfef, on Friday, where Luis Rubiales refused to resign, Diaz said:
""On Friday we saw the worst of Spanish society, of the structural machismo of this country.""
""They clapped and humiliated and made fun of a person they had the obligation to protect under the sports law and far from doing that, they inflicted more damage, more pain, more vexation."" 
However she says Spanish society is predominantly ""feminist"" and ""an example in the world"".
 ""That's why these behaviours are much more shocking,"" she told reporters following a meeting with the footballers' union Futpro.
Guy Hedgecoe
Reporting from Madrid
The members of the national sports tribunal
(TAD) are meeting to evaluate the Spanish government's request for disciplinary
proceedings to be brought against Luis Rubiales. 
The TAD is linked to the
government, but its members are independent legal experts. 
If it decides to open
proceedings against Rubiales, that could potentially lead to his removal.
Separately, Víctor Francos, the head of the government's Higher Sports Council
(CSD) and secretary of state for sport, is due to give a press conference in
Tarragona at 1730BST to explain measures he plans to take in relation to the
Rubiales crisis.
Luis Rubiales' cousin has hit out at what she describes as the ""campaign of harassment and destabilisation"" against the football federation boss.
Vanesa Ruiz Béja was speaking to reporters in the town of Motril in Granada in Spain.
""His mother, who is a very religious person, has taken refuge in God and has gone on hunger strike. She does not want to leave the church,"" she said.
""His family is suffering a lot for him. We don't think it's fair what is happening.""
""We want them to leave us alone, we want justice to be done and this woman to tell the truth. Jenni, we want you to tell the truth.""
As we have been reporting, Jenni Hermoso says she did not consent to the kiss - though Rubiales says it was ""mutual, euphoric and consensual"".
If you are
just joining us, we’ve had a series of significant updates to this story in the past few hours.
It all began after Spanish football federation
president Luis Rubiales kissed midfielder Jenni Hermoso on the lips when Spain won the
Women’s World Cup earlier this month.
Despite increasing pressure, Rubiales
has refused to resign and says the kiss was consensual - a claim  Hermoso strongly
denies.
Here are the latest updates:
Stay with us, we'll bring you more as we get it.
Here's a little bit more from the press conference earlier - we heard from Labour minister Yolanda Diaz, and also from Amanda Gutiérrez Dominguez,
the head of football players' union Futpro.
Gutiérrez Dominguez said what happened at the World Cup was “very sad”
and things must change “internally”.
She said the union did not only want to concentrate on the Rubiales incident, but to make clear that ""this is a cultural problem... social problem of our country in general"".
She went on to criticise the pay gap between male and female footballers.
Gutiérrez Dominguez also said there should also be a focus on Spain’s victory in the Women’s World Cup
final.
A bit more on that investigation now.
According to a statement received by the AFP news agency from the Spanish national court, ""prosecutors from the national court have opened a preliminary investigation to look into the facts, which could constitute an offence of sexual assault"".
The statement indicated the court would offer Hermoso a chance to file a lawsuit.
We've just hearing that Spanish prosecutors have opened a preliminary investigation into Rubiales' kiss of midfielder Jenni Hermoso on the lips. We'll bring you more as we get it.
Yolanda Diaz has been saying that Spain is not a country that practices discrimination.
""We need a real, very thorough reform of the sporting associations and organisations,"" she said.
""They have been threatening, and have the wrong tone - and they are basically supporting the behaviour of Mr Rubiales,"" she says.
Here's a bit more from Yolanda Diaz, Spain's labour minister and also the second deputy prime minister.
She tells reporters: ""We are in a country of systemic machismo and are not only talking about the personal responsibility of Mr Rubiales but also the massive discrimination in Spain against women.""
""This is damaging sport in our country,"" she says.
Spain's labour minister Yolanda Díaz is currently speaking to the media.
She says the applauding of a man who is ""accused of sexual aggression"" is ""unacceptable"".
""We have to protect the victim and not applaud the perpetrator,"" she says.
The coach of Spain’s women’s team Jorge Vilda has criticised the actions of Luis Rubiales, calling the moment he kissed Hermoso “inappropriate and unacceptable”.  
The pair had been allies, with Vilda seen applauding the now-suspended Spanish football chief when he was defending his actions on Friday.
But in a statement released on Saturday night, Vilda said he regrets that the “victory of Spanish women's football has been harmed by the inappropriate behaviour” of the team’s “until-now top leader”. 
Since the kiss, Vilda's entire coaching staff have resigned in protest against Rubiales, but Vilda himself has not stepped down.

Protests erupt in Libya over contact with Israel,"Libya's PM has suspended his foreign minister after she met with her Israeli counterpart.
Libya - a strong backer of the Palestinian cause - does not recognise Israel, and the meeting has sparked protests in the majority Arab state.
Israeli FM Eli Cohen said the ""historic"" meeting was ""the first step"" in establishing relations with Libya.
Israel is working to build closer ties with Arab and Muslim-majority countries which do not officially recognise it.
However Libya's presidential council, which represents its three provinces, said it was illegal to normalise relations with Israel. 
The Speaker's Office in parliament accused Najla Mangoush of grand treason, and Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah has referred her for investigation.
The announcement by Israel that talks had taken place was surprising given that it was not known to be courting Libya, a staunch foe and champion of the Palestinian struggle, especially under former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. 
The statement was also unusual in its level of detail, perhaps intended to offset any anticipated denial from the Libyan side - also by identifying and acknowledging Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani for hosting the meeting in Rome. 
On Monday, an Israeli official told the BBC that the meeting was planned in advance and was not a chance encounter, like Libya's foreign ministry had portrayed it. 
The official stressed that the two sides agreed what would be emphasised in the published statement, which he said had been due to be published on Monday but was released on Sunday after the story was leaked to the Israeli media. 
Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid accused the Israeli foreign ministry of being ""amateurish [and] irresponsible"" and having committed ""a serious failure of judgment"".
Another opposition leader, Benny Gantz, accused the Israeli government of doing ""everything for PR and headlines, with zero responsibility and forward thinking"".
In his statement on Sunday, Mr Cohen said he met Ms Mangoush last week on the sidelines of a summit, and that they discussed ""the great potential for the relations"" between Israel and Libya.
He said they talked about Israeli aid in humanitarian issues, agriculture, water management and the importance of preserving Jewish heritage in Libya, including renovating synagogues and cemeteries. 
Libya's Jewish community was one of the most ancient in the world. However it was persecuted by Nazi occupiers in WWII, and tens of thousands fled to Israel in the wake of antisemitic riots and policies in the decades that followed. Gaddafi repressed the tiny community of Jews which remained until there were none left in Libya by the turn of the century.
Contradicting Mr Cohen's statement, Libya's foreign ministry said Ms Mangoush had rejected a meeting with representatives from Israel, and what had taken place was ""an unprepared, casual encounter during a meeting at Italy's foreign affairs ministry"". 
A statement also said the interaction did not include ""any discussions, agreements or consultations"" and the ministry ""renews its complete and absolute rejection of normalisation"" with Israel.
Protests broke out in the capital Tripoli and some other cities following news of the meeting. Roads were blocked, tyres burnt and demonstrators waved the Palestinian flag, though the protests appear to have been relatively small.
Libya has been in turmoil for years, with the country split between the interim, internationally recognised government in Tripoli and a rival one in the east.
Should any deal between Israel and Libya be brokered, it would be complicated by that political division, which emerged following Gaddafi's overthrow 12 years ago. 
Gen Khalifa Haftar of the Libyan National Army (LNA) runs the rival government in the eastern coastal city of Tobruk.
In recent years, Israel has pursued formal ties with Arab League countries with which it does not have official relations - from moderate states to historical foes.
Since 2020, it has signed US-brokered agreements known as the Abraham Accords normalising relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. The agreements have been met with outrage by the Palestinians, who have accused the Arab signatories of betrayal. 
On Sunday evening, Libya's Presidential Council requested ""clarification"" from the government over what had happened. The Presidential Council carries out the functions of head of state and is in charge of the country's military.
A letter from the body said the meeting between the two foreign ministers ""does not reflect the foreign policy of the Libyan state, does not represent the Libyan national constants and is considered a violation of Libyan laws which criminalise normalisation with the 'Zionist entity'"". 
It also asked Mr Dbeibah ""to apply the law if the meeting took place"".

Germany country profile,"Germany is Europe's largest economy and the most populous country in the European Union. 
Achieving national unity later than other European nations, Germany quickly caught up economically and militarily, before defeats in World War One and World War Two left it shattered, facing the difficult legacy of Nazism and divided between Europe's Cold War blocs.
After 1949, West Germany rebounded to become the continent's economic giant and a prime mover of European cooperation. Franco-German cooperation was central to European economic integration in the 1980s and 1990s.
With the end of the Cold War, the two parts of the country were once again united, although the economy of the former east continues to lag behind the rest of the country.
Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the European Union, signing the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 and co-founding the Eurozone.
Chancellor: Olaf Scholz
The 63-year-old former finance minister defied earlier expectations by winning the September 2021 election. 
He formed a coalition with the Greens and business-friendly Free Democrats in December, becoming the first Social Democrat chancellor since 2005. 
He took over from the Christian Democrat Angela Merkel, Germany's first female chancellor, who governed for 16 years in coalition with either the Free Democrats or the Social Democrats. 
Mr Scholz was her vice-chancellor as well as finance minister in 2018-2021.
Despite having a much more restrained and cautious response than that of other Western countries to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Scholz oversaw an increase in Germany's defence budget, weapons shipments to Ukraine and a discontinuance of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. 
Scholz set out the principles of a new German defence policy in his ""Zeitenwende"" speech to parliament immediately after the invasion.
Scholz described the attack as a ""historic turning point"" and announced that in response his government would use a €100bn fund to significantly increase military spending, reversing Germany's previously cautious defence policy.
President: Frank-Walter Steinmeier
Former foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was elected federal president in February 2017, succeeding Joachim Gauck.
He was reelected in February 2022 for a second five-year term as Germany's president. Although largely ceremonial post, he has been seen as a symbol of consensus and continuity.
His lenient policies toward countries such as Russia and China have earned him criticism both in Germany and internationally.

Germany media guide,"Germany's competitive television market is the largest in Europe, with more than 38 million TV households.
The many regional and national public broadcasters - organised in line with the federal political structure - vie for audiences with powerful commercial operators. Each of Germany's 16 regions regulates its own private and public broadcasting.
The national public broadcasters are TV networks Das Erste and ZDF, and Deutschlandradio. Public TV and radio are funded by a ""broadcasting contribution"" paid by each household. Deutsche Welle (DW) is Germany's international broadcaster.
Germany is home to some of the world's largest media conglomerates, including Bertelsmann and the publisher Axel Springer. The top free-to-air commercial TV networks are operated by RTL Group and ProSiebenSat1 Media.
Germans are avid newspaper readers and the non-tabloid press is a trusted news source. There are several national newspapers, but the press is strongest at the regional and local level. Bild tabloid is the best-selling daily.
Media freedom is enshrined in the constitution. While the press and broadcasters are free and independent, the display of swastikas and statements endorsing Nazism are illegal.
There were 79.1 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 94% of the population (Internetworldstats.com). The leading social network is Facebook, with more than 46 million users.

Evergrande: Shares in the crisis-hit Chinese developer plunge by 80%,"Shares in embattled Chinese property developer Evergrande have fallen almost 80% in their first day of trading in Hong Kong for a year and a half.
The shares have lost more than 99% of their value in the past three years as Beijing cracked down on property firms.
Evergrande is at the centre of a real estate market crisis threatening the world's second largest economy.
On Sunday, the firm posted a 33bn yuan ($4.5bn; £3.6bn) loss for the first six months of the year.
However, that was an improvement on the 66.4bn yuan loss it reported for the same period a year earlier.
The company's directors ""have taken a number of measures to improve the liquidity position and financial position of the group,"" Evergrande said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The firm added that its revenue for the first six months of this year had jumped by 44% to 128.2bn yuan from a year earlier. However, its stockpile of cash fell by 6.3% over the same period.
Evergrande's shares had been suspended from trading since March last year.
""The key for policymakers at this moment is to prevent financial contagion and limit spillover into the overall financial system,"" Qian Wang, chief Asia Pacific economist at investment firm Vanguard told the BBC.
""Policymakers will need to provide further liquidity and credit support to the economy and the real estate sector,"" she added.
Problems in China's property market have added to concerns about the post-pandemic recovery of the world's second largest economy.
Also on Monday, China halved a 0.1% tax on stock trading to ""invigorate the capital market and boost investor confidence"".
Major share indexes in Hong Kong and mainland China rose after the news.
The move came days after the country's central bank cut one of its key interest rates for the second time in three months, in the face of falling exports and weak consumer spending.
Last month, Evergrande revealed that in 2021 and 2022 it lost a combined total of 581.9bn yuan.
Earlier this month, Country Garden, which is also one of China's biggest property developers, warned that it could see a loss of up to $7.6bn (£6bn) for the first six months of the year.
Rating agency Moody's downgraded the company's rating, citing ""heightened liquidity and refinancing risks"".
China's real estate industry was rocked when new rules to control the amount of money big real estate firms could borrow were introduced in 2020.
Evergrande, which was once China's top-selling developer, had racked up debts of more than $300bn as it expanded aggressively to become one of the country's biggest companies.
The firm missed a crucial deadline in 2021 as it failed to make interest payments on around $1.2bn of international loans.
Evergrande has been working to renegotiate its agreements with creditors after defaulting on debt repayments.
Earlier this month, the company made a Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection filing at a court in New York.
Chapter 15 protects the US assets of a foreign company while it works on restructuring its debts.
Evergrande's financial problems have rippled through the country's property industry, with a series of other developers defaulting on their debts and leaving unfinished building projects across the country.

Alexandra Paul: Canadian Olympic figure skater dies in crash,"Canadian Olympic figure skater Alexandra Paul has died in a car accident aged 31.
She was killed when a truck crashed into a number of stationary vehicles in Ontario on Tuesday, police said. 
Her baby, who was in the vehicle with her, survived and was treated for non-life threatening injuries in hospital. 
Ms Paul was a ""shining star on and off the ice"" who left an ""indelible mark"" on the world of figure skating, Skate Canada said.
During her career, she won a silver medal at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in 2010 and represented Canada at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games.
Alongside her partner and husband, Mitchell Islam, she won multiple international medals before retiring from competitive skating in 2016.
""It is with a heavy heart that Skate Canada announces the sudden passing of a cherished member of our skating community, Alexandra Paul,"" the organisation said in a statement.
""As we remember Alexandra's contributions to the sport, we also reflect on the camaraderie and sportsmanship she exemplified. 
""She was not only an accomplished athlete but also a true role model for aspiring skaters, demonstrating the values of resilience, perseverance, and sportsmanlike conduct.
""Our thoughts are with Alexandra's family, friends, and everyone who was fortunate enough to know her during this difficult time.""
Sports broadcaster Michele Tafoya wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Ms Paul was such ""an accomplished young woman"".

China state media calls on British Museum to return artefacts,"A call for the British Museum to return Chinese artefacts after the recent alleged theft of about 2,000 items is heating up social media in the country.
The demand became the most trending topic on Weibo after an editorial in a state-run nationalist newspaper.
In the piece published on Sunday night, Global Times asked the museum to give back all Chinese cultural relics ""free of charge"".
The Chinese government has not commented on the issue yet.
The BBC has reached out to the British Museum for comment but is yet to hear back.
The museum has been under pressure after around 2,000 items were reported ""missing, stolen or damaged"" two weeks ago.
A member of staff was sacked when the news first came out. Last week, its director Hartwig Fischer also announced he would step down.
In its article, Global Times argued that the world-renowned museum has failed to take good care of ""cultural property belonging to other countries"".
""The huge loopholes in the management and security of cultural objects in the British Museum exposed by this scandal have led to the collapse of a long-standing and widely circulated claim that 'foreign cultural objects are better protected in the British Museum',"" the editorial reads.
The British Museum has the biggest collection of Chinese antiquities in the West. According to its website, it has about 23,000 Chinese objects, spanning from the Neolithic age to the present.
These include a large range of precious items such as paintings, prints, jade, bronzes and ceramics. One of the most famous is the reproduction of a scroll called ""Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies"", a masterpiece considered a milestone in Chinese art history. 
This is not the first time Chinese netizens have called on the British Museum to return artefacts in recent years amid a rise in nationalist sentiment.
But the editorial on the suspected thefts has sparked more conversation this time around.
The hashtag  ""The British Museum please return Chinese antiquities"" topped Weibo's search chart until noon local time on Monday. It has been viewed more than half a billion times.
""Return the objects to their original owner,"" a comment liked by more than 32,000 times reads.
""Now that the country is rich and the people are strong, it's time to have our treasures back home,"" another top comment says.
While tens of thousands support Global Times' request, some others were not as impressed.
""Why don't you make a trip to the UK for our treasures? Just shouting on Weibo domestically is just playing safe and shameless,"" a post liked by more than 10,000 times says. 
This video can not be played
Watch: The British Museum's missing-items scandal in 91 seconds
The Global Times, known for its hawkish views, has led the charge in publishing English-language editorials attacking the West, particularly in recent years amid China's deteriorating relationship with the West. 
It is not clear whether the Chinese government will take any action following the calls.
But asking the museum to return artefacts is a sentiment not limited to China. 
Following reports that artefacts had been stolen, other countries have also said the British Museum can no longer be trusted with their antiquities.
The Greek government, which has been asking for the return of the Parthenon Sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, renewed those calls this week.
Greece's Minister of Culture, Lina Mendoni was quoted as saying that the security questions raised by the missing objects ""reinforces the permanent and just demand of our country for the definitive return"" of the Elgin marbles.
Nigerian officials have also called on the museum to return the Benin Bronzes taken from the Benin kingdom that now lies within its territory. 
Tim Loughton MP, the Conservative chairman of the all party parliamentary group for the museum, has called such demands ""opportunistic"".
He told the BBC that other countries should be ""rallying around to help retrieve objects instead of trying to take advantage"".

Jacksonville gunman who shot three dead left racist messages - police,"A man who shot dead three people in a racially motivated attack in Florida wrote of his hatred of black people, police say.
Twenty-one year old Ryan Christopher Palmeter fired eleven rounds at one woman sitting in her car in Jacksonville, before entering a shop and shooting another two people. 
Sheriff T K Waters said he then turned the gun on himself.
Mayor Donna Deegan said the attack was driven by racist hatred.
At a news conference on Sunday, Sheriff Waters confirmed the gunman had no previous criminal history and had lived with his parents in Clay County.
The three victims were identified as Anolt Laguerre Jr, 19, Jerrald De'Shaun Gallion, 29 and 52 year-old Angela Carr.
Mr Laguerre worked at the Dollar General store where the attack happened, the company said.
The gunman had written messages detailing his hatred of black people, police said. 
""Finely put: this shooting was racially motivated and he hated black people."" Sheriff Waters said.
""He knew what he was doing. He was 100% lucid,"" he added. ""He knew what he was doing and again, it's disappointing that anyone would go to these lengths to hurt someone else.""
Mr Waters said the gunman had been detained for 72 hours in 2017 under the Baker Act, mental health legislation that allows the involuntary detainment of an individual for treatment.
But the sheriff said his weapons had been acquired legally, telling reporters the problem was not with the availability of guns, but with the killer being ""a bad guy"". 
He urged people not to ""look for sense in a senseless act of violence"".
Jacksonville police played CCTV video at the news conference showing the moment the attacker walked up to the car where he killed the first woman. It then cut to video of him entering the shop.
Mr Waters also confirmed that the gunman let some people out of the shop without injuring them. 
This video can not be played
Watch: Jacksonville shootings: 'He hated black people'
""Why? I don't know. Some of them were white, but I do believe there was a couple that were not,"" he said. 
US Attorney General Merrick Garland said on Sunday the Justice Department was ""investigating this attack as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism"".
""No person in this country should have to live in fear of hate-fuelled violence and no family should have to grieve the loss of a loved one to bigotry and hate,"" he said.
The attack happened less than a mile from the historically black Edwards Waters University.
The gunman first went to the university campus, where he was asked to identify himself by a security officer, the university said in a statement. When he refused, he was asked to leave.
""The individual returned to their car and left campus without incident,"" the statement added.
Sheriff Waters said the gunman was then seen putting on a bullet-resistant vest and a mask before leaving the campus.
The university went into lockdown after the shooting.

Ukrainians in Herefordshire to get £500 transport grants,"Transport grants worth £500 will be offered to Ukrainian refugees across Herefordshire aged five and above due to a lack of public transport.
The council said the lack of services in rural areas meant Ukrainian guests often had to rely on ""others, particularly their hosts"".
The grant will be given to those aged five and above residing in the county.
They can spend it on public transport, taxis, buying and running a vehicle or bike, or getting a driving licence.
In total there are around 700 Ukrainians living with host families in Herefordshire.
The government pays local authorities £5,900 per person under Homes for Ukraine, down from £10,500 last year.
Herefordshire Council expects the maximum cost of the transport grants to be £330,000, equivalent to 600 guests taking one up plus 10 per cent for administration.
Meanwhile separate funding from the council to support groups helping integrate the Ukrainians, paid for out of the same government funding pot, has been extended for another year.
The Support for Ukraine Community Integration Grant, which makes payments of up to £100,000 to community and voluntary groups, will now run to the end of January 2025.

Spain media guide,"Spain's public broadcaster RTVE competes with large and established commercial operators. 
TV is the main source of news and satellite and cable are popular digital platforms. 
Home-produced dramas, reality shows and long-running soap operas are staple fare on primetime TV.
Regional TV networks are operated by their respective governments and there are many local stations. Movistar+, owned by telecom firm Telefonica, is the biggest pay TV provider.
There is a free press that investigates high-level corruption, says US-based Freedom House. But the organisation raises concerns about the concentration of media ownership and what it says is political interference in public media.
There were 43.5 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 93% of the population (Internetworldstats.com). Facebook is the leading social media platform.

San Marino country profile,"Landlocked San Marino is one of the world's smallest countries. Surrounded by Italy, it is an echo from an era when city-states proliferated across Europe.
Mount Titano, part of the Appennine range, dominates San Marino's landscape. Three defensive fortresses perch on Titano's slopes, looking out to the Adriatic coast.
San Marino is said to be the world's oldest surviving republic.
Tourism dominates the economy of microstate, which plays host to more than three million visitors every year.
Postage stamps and coins - keenly sought by collectors - are important sources of revenue. It is not in the EU but does use the euro, despite not officially being in the Eurozone. 
San Marino's constitution provides for a parliamentary style of government.
The 60-member Great and General Council is elected every five years. It is headed by two Captains Regent, who are elected by the council every six months and act as heads of state and heads of government for that period.
The practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, derives from the customs of the Roman Republic.
The 10-member Congress of State is elected by the Great and General Council and exercises executive power.
There were 20,400 internet users by July 2022, comprising 60% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com).
Some key dates in the history of San Marino:
AD 301 - According to tradition, San Marino is founded by Marinus, a Christian stonemason seeking refuge from religious persecution on Mount Titano.
1243 - The first captains-regent - acting as joint heads of state - are appointed.
1463 - The Pope awards the towns of Fiorentino, Montegiardino and Serravalle to San Marino. The town of Faetano joins the republic in 1464, defining its present-day borders.
1599 - San Marino's constitution, which provides for a parliamentary government, is laid out in the Statutes of 1600. 
1631 - Papacy recognises San Marino's independence. 
1739 - Cardinal Alberoni's forces occupy San Marino. But after a civil disobedience campaign and appeals to the Vatican, the Pope restores San Marino's independence. 
1797 - Napoleon invades Italy, but respects the rights of San Marino. 
1815 - Congress of Vienna, which follows the Napoleonic Wars, recognises San Marino's independence. 
1862 - San Marino signs customs union and treaty of friendship and cooperation with newly-unified Italy. 
1940-45 - San Marino remains neutral during World War Two and hosts some 100,000 refugees from neighbouring parts of Italy.
1944 September - San Marino is briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by the Allies in the Battle of San Marino
1945-57 - San Marino, unlike Italy, has democratically elected communist governments - a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party. 
1957 - The Rovereta Affair, a constitutional crisis between San Marino's then main parties - the Christian Democrats and the Communists - triggered by Socialist Party's withdrawal from the coalition following the 1956 crushing of the Hungarian revolution. 
The year sees competing governments, armed militias, US and Italian intervention and an Italian blockade of San Marino. The  Communist government eventually steps down and Christian Democrats take power.
1988 - San Marino joins the Council of Europe. 
1992 - San Marino joins the United Nations.
2002 - San Marino signs treaty with OECD to provide greater transparency in banking and taxation, as a result of which it is removed from the OECD's blacklist list of tax havens and placed on the ""grey list"" (consisting of countries that have pledged to comply with rules on sharing tax information but have yet to do so). 
2009 - San Marino says it is taking steps to ensure the country complies with OECD rules on financial transparency so as to be removed from tax haven ""grey list"".
2022 - San Marino legalises abortion. It had been one of the last European countries to have a complete ban on abortions.

Luxembourg media guide,"Luxembourg exerts immense media clout and has a long tradition of operating radio and TV services for pan-European audiences, including those in France, Germany and the UK.
Media group RTL is behind much of this activity. Its outlets have been a part of the broadcasting landscape in France and Germany for decades.

Luxembourg country profile,"The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg - a small country landlocked by Belgium, France and Germany - is a prominent financial centre.
With roots stretching back to the 10th Century, Luxembourg's history is closely intertwined with that of its more powerful neighbours, especially Germany.
Many of its inhabitants are trilingual in French, German and Luxembourgish.
Despite declaring its neutrality, Luxembourg was occupied by Germany during both World Wars.
After renewed occupation in World War Two, Luxembourg abandoned its neutrality and became a front-rank enthusiast for international co-operation.
Luxembourg's prosperity was formerly based on steel manufacturing. With the decline of that industry, Luxembourg diversified and is now best known for its status as Europe's most powerful investment management centre.
Head of state: Grand Duke Henri
The ruling Grand Duke of Luxembourg succeeded to the title in 2000, on the abdication of his father Jean. He had already exercised the constitutional powers of the monarch since 1998.
Born in 1955, the future Grand Duke Henri studied politics in Geneva, where he met his Cuban wife Maria Teresa. He later underwent officer training at Britain's Sandhurst Academy.
The head of state's constitutional role is largely ceremonial. In 2008, following a bitter controversy over euthanasia parliament  rescinded the Grand Duke's veto powers after Henri opposed the pro-euthanasia law on religious grounds.
Prime Minister: Xavier Bettel
Xavier Bettel formed a government in December 2013 after snap elections in October at which his Democratic Party, the Socialists and Greens emerged with a small majority over the largest overall group, the conservative Christian Social Party.
The vote was called after Jean-Claude Juncker of the Christian Social Party, who had been prime minister since 1995, lost his majority in parliament when the Socialists quit his coalition in July 2013 over a phone-tapping scandal.
The Christian Social Party had been in government since 1979.
Xavier Bettel, who had been the mayor of Luxembourg City between 2011 and 2013, is the country's first openly gay prime minister.
In December 2018, he was sworn in for a second term, following the narrow victory of his liberal-led coalition in the parliamentary elections. The next election is due by October 2023.
Luxembourg exerts immense media clout and has a long tradition of operating radio and TV services for pan-European audiences, including those in France, Germany and the UK.
Generations of British listeners grew up with Radio Luxembourg, which beamed pop music programmes into the UK. ""The Great 208"" is no more, but media group RTL is still a key player in media markets across Europe.
Luxembourg's media empire extends to the skies. It is home to Europe's largest satellite operator, Societe Europeenne des Satellites (SES), which operates the Astra fleet.
Some key dates in the history of Luxembourg:
1839 - Treaty of London gives the western part of the country to the recently-created state of Belgium - giving Luxembourg its modern-day borders. 
1866 - Luxembourg crisis nearly sees war between France and Prussia as neither is willing concede influence in Luxembourg to its rival. The crisis is solved by an agreement on Luxembourg's independence and neutrality at the Second Treaty of London in 1867.

1920 - Luxembourg joins the League of Nations.
1921 - Luxembourg enters economic union with Belgium. The use of the Belgian currency in Luxembourg is permitted. 
1940-44 - Luxembourg is again occupied by Germany during World War Two.

2000 - Crown Prince Henri becomes Grand Duke of Luxembourg on the abdication of his father, Jean.
2002 - Euro introduced as national currency.
2008 - Parliament approves reform restricting the monarch to a purely ceremonial role after Grand Duke Henri's threat to block a bill legalising euthanasia sparks a constitutional crisis.
2009 - G20 adds Luxembourg to ""grey list"" of countries with questionable banking arrangements. Shortly afterwards the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) commends Luxembourg for improving financial transparency with agreements with a dozen countries.
2014 - Luxembourg's parliament votes to legalise same-sex marriage. The so-called LuxLeaks scandal casts light on how Luxembourg helped hundreds of multi-national companies - Apple, Ikea, and Pepsi among them - save billions of dollars in tax payments.
2016 - In a continuation of the so-called LuxLeaks scandal, two former employees of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers are given suspended prison sentences for leaking confidential documents revealing corporate tax deals.

Libya country profile,"Libya, a mostly desert oil-rich country, has become a key springboard for migrants heading for Europe, and a source of international tension as rival governments in the west and east seek to establish nationwide control.
Libya was under foreign control for centuries until it gained independence in 1951. Soon after, oil was discovered and earned the country immense wealth. 
Colonel Gaddafi seized power in 1969 and ruled for four decades until he was toppled and killed in 2011 in a rebellion assisted by Western military intervention.
Since 2014, Libya has been divided into competing political and military factions based in different parts of the country. The two sides signed a permanent ceasefire in 2020, but political rivalries continue.
Prime Minister: Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh (Government of National Unity)
A Government of National Unity (GNU) was formed in March 2021, based in Tripoli, with Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh as the internationally-recognised prime minister.
This was Libya's sole government for the first time in nearly seven years, successfully replacing the parallel administrations that had existed since 2014.
But that this was short lived, and in March 2022 the country was divided again when the eastern-based parliament formed the rival Government of National Stability (GNS) under the leadership of prime minister Fathi Bashagha. 
The GNS has struggled to assert its legitimacy internationally.
Libya's media environment is highly-polarised and virtually unregulated, reflecting the country's political instability. 
Satellite TV is a key news source and many outlets are based outside Libya. 
Journalism is fraught with danger; reporters face threats and attacks. 
Some key dates in Libya's history: 
643AD - Arabs under Amr Ibn al-As conquer Libya and spread Islam.
16th Century - Libya becomes part of the Ottoman Empire, which joins the three provinces of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Fezzan into one regency in Tripoli.
1911-12 - Italy seizes Libya from the Ottomans. 
1920s  - Libyan resistance to Italian rule grows.
1931 - Italy breaks resistance through combination of major armed operations and concentration camps for rebel population. 
1934 - Italy steps up Italian migration as part of an eventual plan for the incorporation of Libya into a Greater Italy.
1942 - Allies oust Italians and their German allies from Libya after a two-year campaign. 
1951 - Libya becomes independent under King Idris.
1956 - Development of Libya's oil reserves starts.
1969 - Muammar Gaddafi, deposes King Idris. 
1971 - National referendum approves proposed Federation of Arab Republics (FAR) comprising Libya, Egypt and Syria. However, the FAR never takes off.
1977 - Col Gaddafi declares a ""people's revolution"", changing the country's official name from the Libyan Arab Republic to the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and setting up ""revolutionary committees"".
1992 - UN imposes sanctions on Libya over the bombing of a PanAm airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988.
2011 - Violent protests break out in Benghazi and spread to other cities. This leads to civil war, foreign intervention and the overthrow and death of Colonel Gaddafi.
2016 - Following years of conflict, a new UN-backed government is installed at Tripoli. It faces opposition from rival governments and a host of militias. 
2021 - Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh takes over as prime minister of the UN-backed Government of National Accord in Tripoli.
2023 - Rival sides agree to set up a committee to oversee the sharing of oil revenues.

North Korea: Country eases Covid rules to let in citizens stuck abroad,"North Korea will start allowing in citizens who have been locked out for almost four years due to pandemic border controls, state media KCNA said.
Returning individuals will be subject to a seven-day quarantine under medical supervision at dedicated facilities. 
It appears to be its latest act to scale back Covid restrictions, coming just days after the first Pyongyang flight landed in Beijing since 2020. 
China last week reopened commercial air travel between Beijing and Pyongyang.
North Korea  is one of the last few countries to do so.
Last month, Chinese and Russian officials became the first foreign dignitaries to visit North Korea since it shut its borders, arriving in Pyongyang to attend a military parade.
Weeks later, the country allowed a delegation of its athletes to participate in a taekwondo competition in Kazakhstan.
Last Tuesday, an Air Koryo plane - North Korea's flagship carrier - arrived in China, a day after Chinese foreign ministry said it had approved the restarting of commercial flights between the two countries. 
It was unclear who was on board the return flight to Pyongyang, but Yonhap news reported a flurry of North Korean travellers waiting in line at Beijing International Airport.
Many of the stranded North Korean students, workers, and diplomats have been stuck in China for three and a half years. 
While citizens are now allowed to return home, it is unclear when foreign diplomats and aid workers will be let into the country.
Reclusive North Korea had sealed itself off in early 2020 to keep the pandemic out, but also walled itself off from all trade and diplomatic ties, cutting off imports of essential goods like food and medicine.
Many foreign delegations, unable to rotate their staff or send in supplies for much of the pandemic, had to shut their embassies in Pyongyang.
Since then, North Korea has been facing food shortages, made worse by strict international sanctions placed on the country because of its nuclear programme.
But as North Korea begins to dismantle the remaining vestiges of its Covid-era restrictions, a move it says lines up with the worldwide pandemic situation, it has raised hopes that borders might soon reopen to the foreign diplomat and aid. 
But the process is expected to be tightly controlled and could still take years.

Fukushima: Japan asks China to stop citizens making abusive calls,"Japan has complained to China after local businesses and institutions were inundated with abusive phone calls over the Fukushima nuclear plant discharge.
The calls come from numbers with Chinese dialling codes. One restaurant chain in Fukushima reported more than 1,000 calls since last Thursday.
Tokyo has also warned citizens visiting China to take precautions and avoid speaking Japanese loudly.
Beijing has led criticism of last week's release of treated wastewater.
Tokyo has made daily reports, saying the seawater around the nuclear plant is showing no detectable levels of radioactivity. 
Japanese authorities say the calls from Chinese numbers began after the release of water and they were made to government departments, schools and even an aquarium.
The callers speak in Chinese, Japanese and English - and sometimes use abusive language. They speak about their opposition to Japan's decision to release the treated nuclear water.
China has described the discharge as an ""extremely selfish and irresponsible act"".
On Thursday it said it would ban Japanese seafood imports.
Meanwhile, Tokyo is hoping regular radiation testing in the waters near the plant will allay concerns from neighbouring countries and fishing groups.
Weekly test results will be published for the next three months.
More than a million tonnes of water stored at the nuclear plant will be discharged over the next 30 years.
It has been accumulating since 2011 when the plant was badly damaged by a tsunami.
Japan says the water is safe, and the UN's nuclear watchdog has approved the plan, but critics say the release should be halted.
The water is being filtered to remove most radioactive elements then diluted to reduce levels of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen which is difficult to separate from water.
The Environment Ministry said samples from 11 locations near the plant showed tritium levels below 7-8 becquerels per litre, the lower limit of detection.
The water ""would have no adverse impact on human health and the environment"", it added.
There has also been opposition to the release of water in South Korea, and on Thursday protesters in the capital Seoul attempted to storm the Japanese embassy.
On Sunday, South Korea said it had sent nuclear experts to Fukushima to monitor the discharge process.

Himachal Pradesh: Shimla residents reel from devastation caused by heavy rains,"""I saw our house falling. You can't imagine how I felt.""
Forty-five-year-old Suman's voice trembled as she recounted the harrowing sight of her family home collapsing on the day India celebrated its Independence on 15 August. 
""I screamed loudly. But I couldn't do anything,"" she said, wiping tears.
Shimla, a town in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh in northern India is known for its tranquillity and British colonial-era charm. 
Suman's family home, built after years of effort, was among several washed away in the torrential rains and  landslides that hit the state this monsoon season.
""Our parents had put in their life's savings to build this house,"" Suman told the BBC from a relief camp, set up by the state government, where her family has taken shelter. 
""To see this is unbearable. We don't even want to build any house now. We have given up.""
Weeks of heavy rainfall have affected thousands of people across Himachal Pradesh and the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand, causing widespread destruction of life and property.
State government reports reveal at least 348 people have died due to rain-related incidents such as landslides and flash floods since June. 
With nearly 80 deaths, Shimla, the capital of Himachal Pradesh, was hit particularly hard.
Chief Minister Sukhwinder Sukhu said the state's loss exceeded 100bn rupees ($1.2bn, £961m), underscoring the magnitude of the destruction.
More than 2,220 homes have been obliterated while another 10,000 houses lie partially damaged. The wreckage extends to commercial spaces, with 300 shops rendered unusable.
The toll on livestock is equally devastating, with nearly 10,000 poultry birds and more than 6,000 cattle and various other animals dead.
The landscape bears the scars of 131 landslides and 60 flash floods the region has witnessed, altering its topography. 
Roads in Shimla are blocked every few hundred metres by fallen trees or the heaps of mud and rocks that have tumbled off the hills. 
People living in these hills are still reeling from the devastation that surrounds them. 
On 14 August, 20 people died after a Shiva temple in Shimla was buried under a landslide. 
One family lost seven members as the temple's surroundings were inundated with slush, rocks and water. 
The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and other rescue agencies launched an arduous search for survivors and bodies in the aftermath of the temple tragedy. 
Sanjay Thakur lost his 17-year-old son Saurabh in the disaster. 
""We heard the sound of a thunder that morning,"" he said, adding that he ran towards the temple where his son was visiting.
""I saw that the building had fallen partially. A person stuck in debris was shouting for help,"" he told the BBC. ""We quickly rushed to rescue him. Then another landslide took place and earth from the rail tracks above the temple came down washing the temple away. There was nothing left.""
Locals helped the family look for Saurabh. They found his body the next day. 
""I miss everything about my son,"" he said. ""His books are lying here. So are his clothes. Only he isn't around. But nobody can do anything now.""
The devastation also shattered livelihoods of people like Akash Kumar, whose family relied on his meat shop for income.
The collapse of a state-owned slaughterhouse has left them without work. 
""We used to get supplies from the slaughterhouse and then sell it at our shop,"" Mr Kumar said. ""But the slaughterhouse caved in and our house situated not far from there was declared endangered.
""We can't figure out how we will earn our livelihood now and where we will eat,"" he added.
His family includes his parents, four brothers and their wives and children - all of whom have now taken shelter in a rehabilitation camp in Shimla.
After the landslides on 14 and 15 August, recovery efforts were underway in Shimla when another major landslide struck the state's Kullu district on 24 August. Footage from the area showed buildings collapse like a house of cards. 
The full extent of the damage caused by this landslide is yet to be determined. Officials say occupants of the buildings were evacuated a few days earlier. 
But residents across Himachal Pradesh live in constant anxiety. 
A massive thunderstorm that hit Shimla in the early hours of 23 August left locals sleepless and in fear. 
""Lightning and thunder began around 3am,"" says Rajesh Negi, a hotel worker. ""We left our homes, fearing they might collapse any moment. 
""We've never seen anything like this before,"" he says. ""Fear and stress have taken over our lives now.""

Taliban stop female Afghan students leaving country to study in Dubai,"""After the Taliban shut universities for women, my only hope was to get a scholarship which would help me study abroad,"" says 20-year-old Afghan student Natkai.
Natkai's name has been changed for her own safety.
The Taliban have cracked down hard on women who oppose them. 
Natkai says she kept studying even though there was little chance of her ever attending university in her homeland.
Then she was granted a scholarship to study at the University of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Emirati billionaire businessman Sheikh Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor.
The scholarships for Afghan women were announced in December 2022 after the Taliban banned women from university.
The BBC understands a total of 100 Afghan women have been successful in gaining these scholarships. Some Afghan students living abroad have already travelled to Dubai.
On Wednesday 23 August, Natkai said goodbye to her family and set off for the airport. 
But her hopes were soon dashed. 
""When the Taliban officials saw our tickets and student visas, they said girls are not allowed to leave Afghanistan on student visas,"" she tells me, her voice breaking. 
Natkai is one of at least 60 girls who were turned away from the airport.
Photos seen by the BBC show young girls wearing black hijabs or headscarves standing next to their luggage in a state of shock and devastation. 
The Taliban has banned solo travel for women and only allow them to go abroad with their husbands or a related male companion such as a brother, uncle or father, known as a mahram, a male escort. 
But even this was not enough.
""Three girls who had a mahram were inside the plane,"" says Natkai. ""But officials from the Vice and Virtue ministry took them off the plane.""
The rest of the students were too frightened to talk to the media. 
A young man we're calling Shams Ahmad, accompanied his sister to the airport and described the distress. 
""The scholarship gave new hope to my sister after the universities were closed here. She left home with hope and returned in tears,"" he says. ""All her rights have been taken away.""
Mr Ahmad says some of the women even borrowed money to pay for a visa for a male companion to accompany them but were still stopped. 
""Some of these girls are so helpless and poor. They don't even have 400 Afghanis (£4; $5) for the document verification fee requested by the foreign affairs ministry.""  
The University of Dubai and Mr Al Habtoor have confirmed the girls were stopped.
Mr Al Habtoor posted a video message in English on X, formerly known as Twitter. In it, he criticises the Taliban authorities, saying men and women are equal under Islam.
The video also contains a voice note in English from an Afghan girl who was stopped at the airport. 
""We are right now in the airport but unfortunately, the government is not allowing us to go to Dubai,"" she says. ""Even they don't allow those who have a mahram. I don't know what to do. Please help us.""
This latest Taliban action has created dismay among rights groups and diplomats.
""This is an important and alarming step beyond the extraordinary level of cruelty the Taliban already engage in by denying girls and women education,"" says Heather Barr of Human Rights Watch.
""This is holding them prisoner to prevent others from helping them study."" 
The former United Nations youth representative from Afghanistan, Shkula Zadran, has posted a message urging the university not to give up on the girls.
The Taliban have not issued any statement or clarification.
A spokesperson for the Vice and Virtue ministry, Mohammad Sadiq Akif Muhajir, told the BBC they were not aware of the incident. 
A senior Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, also declined to comment, saying he was travelling and did not have any information. 
Natkai is in a state of despondency.  
She had graduated from high school and was preparing for the university entrance exam just as the Taliban took power on 15 August 2021.
Natkai thought she had found a way to follow her dreams. She says she has nothing to say to the Taliban because ""they don't accept or respect women"".
She calls on the world not to abandon Afghan girls or their education.
""I missed this opportunity in a country where it is a crime to be a girl. I'm very sad and I don't know what to do or what will happen to me next.""

Uttar Pradesh: India school shut down over slapping row,"Authorities in India's Uttar Pradesh state have sealed a private school after its teacher asked students to slap their Muslim classmate.
Officials said Neha Public School was shut down as it ""did not meet the education department's criteria.""
The school's students would be shifted to a government school or other nearby schools, officials said.
Meanwhile, the teacher - Tripta Tyagi - has told NDTV news channel that she was ""not ashamed"" of her actions.
The child's family has said he was beaten up for getting his times tables wrong.
A video of Ms Tyagi telling her pupils to slap their seven-year-old Muslim classmate at a small private school in Muzaffarnagar district went viral on social media at the weekend. 
""Why are you hitting him so lightly? Hit him harder,"" the teacher is heard telling the children, as the boy stands crying.
""Hit him on the back... His face is turning red, so hit him on the back now,"" she added.
The victim's father reported the incident to police and took him out of the school. But he did not press charges.
The video sparked outrage on social media, with several users saying that action should be taken against the teacher. 
The police have registered a case against Ms Tyagi but she has not been arrested. The charges are bailable.
On Sunday, education officer Shubham Shukla said the authorities were investigating the incident.
An unnamed official told the Indian Express newspaper that the school had no lights or fans and that there were no proper sections for different classes. 
Ms Tyagi has not yet commented on the sealing of the school.
However, in an interview to NDTV news channel, she defended her actions saying that they were necessary to ""control"" and ""tackle"" children in school.
The incident has sparked national outrage, with several opposition politicians calling it a ""hate crime"". Uttar Pradesh has been governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since 2017.
India's opposition Congress party MP Rahul Gandhi said the BJP had contributed to religious tensions being felt across India.
""Sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children, turning a holy place like a school into a marketplace of hatred,"" he posted on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. ""This is the same kerosene spread by the BJP that has set every corner of India on fire.""
In June during a visit to the US, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told journalists that there was ""absolutely no space for discrimination"" in India.

Jenni Hermoso: Players and fans support Spain World Cup star in kiss row,"Players and fans have shown their support for World Cup star Jenni Hermoso after she was kissed on the lips by Spain's Football Federation (RFEF) president Luis Rubiales.
Slogans such as ""we are Jenni"" and ""we're with you"" took centre stage at some La Liga and Copa de la Reina matches over the weekend.
The shows of support were not just confined to the football pitch. Protests gripped Spain after Luis Rubiales kissed the player following Spain's win over England in Sydney a week ago.
He was provisionally suspended by Fifa for 90 days on Saturday, after 33-year-old Hermoso said the kiss prior to the team lifting the trophy was not consensual, despite Rubiales's claims to the contrary.
The 46-year-old called it ""mutual, euphoric and consensual"".
Rubiales's refusal to quit and insistence he would ""fight until the end"" overshadowed Spain's win and the wider conversation around women's sport.
An internal investigation has been launched by the RFEF, but only after it initially said it would take legal action over Hermoso's comments and questioned her version of events.
The RFEF will hold an urgent meeting on Monday. The country's sports court will also meet.

China’s summer of climate destruction,"China's summer this year has seen both extreme heat and devastating floods.
And the flooding this time around has struck areas where such weather has been unheard of, with scientists - blaming climate change - warning that the worst is yet to come.
""I've never seen a flood here in my whole life,"" says 38-year-old Zhang Junhua, standing next to a vast patch of rice, now completely useless. ""We just didn't expect it.""
His family and friends are safe, he says, because they were given plenty of warning to get to higher ground, but everyone in his village now has some tough months ahead.
What's more, the devastation in north-east China's Heilongjiang Province has had a major impact on food supplies for the whole country.
This month, 40% of the area's famous Wuchang rice crop has been wiped out, visibly flattened by the volume and speed of the water. Places which should appear lush and green are today brown and dead.
""The fields where we planted our crops were all submerged. We can't plant again this year,"" says another farmer, Zhao Lijuan, as she smiles and tries to be philosophical about the impact on her community.
""The losses are incalculable. We have tens of thousands of acres of rice fields here,"" the 56-year-old says, adding: ""When I saw the water come here, I cried. It laid waste to everything and I am scared the typhoons will be back.""
At least 81 people have been killed in the recent floods, including some trying to rescue others.
But the economic pain has been much wider, in a country already struggling to recover following three years of strict coronavirus control measures.
And, if the government wants to measure the immediate cost of not addressing climate change urgently, it need look no further than its own statistics.
In a little over a decade, the number of floods being recorded in the country has increased tenfold.
In the summer of 2011, there were six to eight monthly floods listed in China. Last year, more than 130 were recorded in July and 82 in August.
According to Dr Zhao Li from Greenpeace East Asia, the increase in flood numbers can be partially explained by China developing better systems to monitor and record flood data.
But she says global warming is still clearly a major contributing factor.
""Warmer temperatures can enhance evaporation rates, resulting in more moisture in the atmosphere,"" she says. ""This increased moisture content can lead to more intense rainfall and more frequent and severe storms, including hurricanes and cyclones.""
A Greenpeace study from two years ago, using UN climate panel mapping, found that more heatwaves and extreme rainfall would effectively extend summer by one month during this century in the provinces around Beijing and Shanghai. In the Pearl River delta, it would be by more than 40 days.
The Chinese government's own Meteorological Administration officials have reported that extreme high temperatures and extreme precipitation have definitely increased since the mid-1990s.
However, in the face of potential catastrophes, Dr Zhao Li from Greenpeace warns that human beings are not ready for what is just around the corner.
""We are not prepared for extreme weather events. Recent experiences from the floods underline that,"" Dr Zhao says. 
""It's an immense and perhaps unrealistic task to upgrade all infrastructure to be able to face a flood that is the worst in hundreds of years. However, climate change is bringing those once-a-century events into rotation with a frequency that shows we will soon have to control a disaster again.""
Officials in China tried to ease the impact of recent floods by using a system of dams of waterways to change their direction.
The problem is that the water has to go somewhere, and it was Zhuozhou in Hebei Province which took the hit. 
These are tough choices but, in the end, it becomes a government decision over who must suffer for the greater good.
In Zhuozhou, for many, a bright future is still a long way away.
""It'll take me eight to 10 years to recover from these losses,"" says Mr Zhang, who has two small businesses there. ""The government has not said whether it will compensate us. I run two shops but what I can I do?""
A few weeks ago, cars were still slowly pushing through lingering floodwaters and mush in the main street. On either side of the road were mud-caked vehicles, with windscreens smashed in as they were submerged when the water suddenly rose with such force.
A brown line revealed what was the high-water mark, with all manner of first-floor items swallowed up and spat out into the street as the flood spread the carnage.
""We suffered big losses: trucks and other vehicles; our goods; furniture; everything we own was wrecked,"" says Mrs Han, who operates a warehouse for deliveries with her husband. 
He indicates how even the goods stored high on racks well above three metres were ruined.
Then his wife opens the door to their nearby home - a thick layer of mud cakes everything.
""Every day we keep trying to clear more mud out,"" she says. ""I can't describe how I felt when I saw this. It's as if our life's work is over.""
Climate scientists are the first to acknowledge that you can't view any extreme weather experience in isolation.
In June, northern China was baking, with week after week of temperatures soaring above 40C (104F), and then a month's worth of rain bucketed down in 24 hours.
""These weather events do happen without climate change,"" says Prof Cascade Tuholske. ""The mechanisms driving individual events, or compound events like heatwaves and floods impacting China this summer are complex, but climate change is making extreme events more common and more intense.""
The professor, a geographer at Montana State University, adds that ""climate change-driven weather extremes are a huge problem for China because of its dense population and as a major global economy"".
He also says that ""every tonne of CO2 that remains in the ground, means fewer people in China will be harmed in the future"".
Whether because of droughts or sudden floods, extreme weather is again drawing attention to the impact of climate change on China, with serious questions being asked about whether or not the measures in place to fight it are currently ambitious enough to rein in the destructive force of these potentially catastrophic events.
But this is a global challenge that cannot be fixed in any one country alone.

The mobile game funding a revolution in Myanmar,"When soldiers in Myanmar arrested Ko Toot's friend and his pregnant wife after the February 2021 coup, he became so angry he decided to join efforts to remove the military from power - by using his IT skills.
The app-based mobile game that he developed is based on ""real events"" in the country and has proved a hit - incensing the ruling junta and raising funds for the anti-military resistance.
""They had never done a single criminal thing in their lives,"" said Ko Toot of the couple, who were detained for supporting the pro-democracy movement.
He didn't know what had happened to them. The BBC only recently established the woman was released within a day, but the man was held for about a year and a half.
After their arrest, Ko Toot then heard the military had detained the wife and infant daughter of a pro-democracy activist it had been unable to locate. 
""Imagine you are a young child and you grow up inside a dirty, stressful and sadistic prison, and you have no idea what's going on. It made my blood boil."" 
So Ko Toot, who works as an IT professional, decided he had to be part of the movement to oust the ""cruel and dangerous"" military - and began working on his game.
Ko Toot spoke to the BBC by text message on an encrypted app, and would not reveal his location. We are using a pseudonym for his safety.
Myanmar descended into almost full-scale civil war after the coup. 
More than 4,000 people have been killed by the military since then, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group. The UN says the death toll is ""likely to be far higher"". 
Gauging troop casualties is hard - the military has acknowledged losses but not given a figure. The exiled National Unity Government says the resistance has killed 20,000 soldiers, but the BBC has not verified this figure.
Ko Toot's aim was to raise funds for arms and humanitarian aid for the anti-military forces known as People's Defence Forces (PDF), as well as increase awareness about the situation in the country.
""I felt that we had very limited international help and awareness,"" he said, comparing the coverage of the crisis in Myanmar unfavourably with that of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
His game originally launched as The PDF Game in early 2022.
It is free to download, but players watch in-game ads to raise money, and Ko Toot estimates proceeds raised so far total at least $508,000 (£403,000). 
He estimates he now makes between $70,000 and $80,000 per month, and claims the figure is ""increasing each month"".
Players take the role of PDF soldiers fighting against military troops, and work through missions similar to real ones in Myanmar.
Ko Toot said he created characters based on real people fighting the military, including doctors, Muslims and members of the LGBT community. 
He said it was important to document them because ""they are fighting in a real war"". 
The game is available on both the Google and Apple app stores, although it had faced issues due to the companies' policies around sensitive events, Ko Toot said. 
On Google Play it has been renamed ""War of Heroes - The PDF Game"". Google said it does not allow apps that ""capitalise on or are insensitive toward a sensitive event"", but that content is generally allowed if it ""intends to alert users to or raise awareness"" about the event. 
The name also had to be changed on Apple's App Store, to ""War of Heroes"", before it was removed from the platform - this was a ""huge blow"", Ko Toot said. 
Apple said the app violated its guidelines - notably that enemies in a game ""cannot solely target"" a ""real government, corporation or any other real entity"", as well as a policy around violent conflicts. 
It has since been reinstated after Ko Toot made amendments, including to the original artwork, as well as the removal of some military missions. 
""This is definitely good news, and we expect to make more income now,"" he said.
The game has also attracted the ire of the ruling junta in Myanmar, who in April issued a notice in state-run media warning the public they could face legal action for ""playing the PDF game"". 
It said ""terrorist organisations"", such as the exiled National Unity Government, had created the game to raise funds for PDFs, ""sow mistrust"" against the military and thus ""grow their anti-army revolutionary spirits"". 
Ko Toot is unfazed by the military's threats. ""I don't care what they say,"" he said. 
""They have already tried to stop this several times, but we will just keep going - there's no way of stopping the digital strike,"" he said of the online efforts to defeat the military. 
The game has been downloaded ""almost"" one million times, Ko Toot said. (Google Play says it has been downloaded more than 500,000 times, while Apple does not provide information on the number of downloads.)
He thinks the amount raised could be much higher than his estimate because, working with a small team, it has taken him a long time to receive some of the money. 
These funds are sent to local PDFs, and are used for food and arms for resistance groups, as well as humanitarian support, including funds for children displaced by the conflict and those injured fighting the military, he said. 
""We just send funds to the defence groups, but don't say how to use them."" 
Formed in response to the 2021 coup, the PDFs have linked up with armed groups formed along ethnic lines that have been operating in border areas for decades. They are proving to be a much stronger force than many expected and the Myanmar military has lost control of large parts of the country. 
With limited finances and arms networks, grassroots funding efforts have been crucial in procuring arms and other supplies for the resistance, in a conflict that is heightening in intensity. 
Ko Toot said he had considered quitting several times, but ""the situation in Myanmar is getting worse every day"" and he wants to continue supporting the anti-military movement. 
""The game has potential,"" he said, adding that he hopes to eventually raise $1m per month. 
""I hope this money will help the [Myanmar] people, who need it desperately.""

"Legacy bill: Irish government should consider UK legal action, says Sinn Féin","Michelle O'Neill has said the Irish government should consider legal action if the UK refuses to withdraw its controversial Northern Ireland legacy bill.
Sinn Féin's deputy leader was speaking at a memorial event in Cork on Sunday.
She said the proposed bill was a ""denial of human rights of victims and their families"".
The bill would end Troubles-era cases and inquests, and offer a conditional amnesty to those accused of killings.
Speaking at Sinn Féin's 42nd annual National Hunger Strike Commemoration, Ms O'Neill said the ""anti-democratic, unjust"" legislation's sole purpose is to ""conceal the truth and protect British state forces"".
""The British government should withdraw this legislation.
""And if the British government do not withdraw this legislation, the Irish government should confront this denial of human rights through an interstate case and international action against the British government.""
Ms O'Neill also used her speech to call upon the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to return to the power-sharing assembly.
Sinn Féin became the biggest party at Stormont after an election in May 2022, meaning Ms O'Neill is entitled to be first minister.
But the DUP's refusal to join an executive has prevented her from doing so.
The DUP has said it will not return to devolved government until its complaints about the post-Brexit trading arrangement are addressed.

Agnipath scheme: The pain of Nepal's Gurkhas over Indian army's new hiring plan,"For decades, Nepal has allowed its ethnic Gurkha soldiers to join the Indian army under a special agreement. The practice came to an abrupt halt last year after India introduced a controversial new army hiring plan, straining ties between the two neighbouring countries. 
The Gurkhas, famed for their ferocity and bravery, have fought several wars over the decades for both the Indian and British armies. 
They were first recruited by the British East India company in 1815 following a peace deal with Nepal.  
After the end of colonial rule in 1947 a tripartite agreement between Nepal, India and Britain allowed Delhi and London to continue to recruit Gurkhas to their military. 
But the arrangement with Delhi came to a halt last year after the Indian government announced Agnipath, a new hiring scheme for its soldiers. 
Agnipath, or Path of Fire, hires soldiers on a fixed four-year term. Only a top performing 25% will be retained for India's central security forces. The rest will be allowed to leave with a lumpsum amount of nearly $15,000 (£11,915) without pension or any other career benefits.
The rules also apply to the Gurkha soldiers who have historically served for much longer terms in both the Indian and British armies. 
Nepali officials say they were taken aback by Delhi's abrupt decision, as they were neither informed nor consulted on such a crucial change to the military recruitment programme. 
""We have a policy that if there is any change made to a tripartite treaty, then it should be implemented through a political consensus,"" Nepalese Foreign Minister NP Saud told the BBC, adding that the recruitment of Gurkhas would be postponed for now. 
With most Nepalese political parties stoutly opposed to the change, it has become even more difficult for the current government to reach a consensus. 
""We are not going to accept the new plan. If India is ready to revert back to the older Gurkha recruitment process, then it can be resumed,"" Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, a senior leader of the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML) told the BBC.
Prior to the new scheme, India on average recruited about 1,400 Nepali citizens into its Gurkha regiments every year. 
There are about 35,000 Nepali Gurkhas currently serving in the Indian army, including in the geopolitically sensitive region of Indian-administered Kashmir and the northeastern parts of the country. 
Delhi argues that the new hiring plan will reduce its army expenditure on ballooning salaries and pensions, which consume more than half of its defence budget. The short-term contracts will also lower the average age of its 1.3 million-strong armed forces. 
For Nepal, this raises fears of a heightened risk from insurgents.
""There is a danger that a person with four years of military combat training can be recruited by any insurgent group in the country or even by foreign mercenaries,"" said Prem Singh Basnyat, a Nepalese military historian and a retired army officer. 
Nepal suffered heavily due to a decade-long armed rebellion by Maoists that ended in 2006. Thousands of people were killed during the unrest. The country says it is not in a position to offer employment to all those who return from India. 
There have been calls in India as well to exempt the Nepali Gurkhas from the short-term contracts. 
Maj Gen (Retd) Ashok Mehta, who served in the Indian Gurkha regiment, says the Agnipath scheme could complicate Delhi's ties with Kathmandu.
""The Indian government abrogated its responsibility in following diplomatic niceties, especially with a country like Nepal with which it claims special and unique relationship,"" he said. 
Indian officials have hinted that if Gurkhas from Nepal do not take up short-term contracts, then the jobs could be distributed to others in India for the time being. 
The BBC has reached out to India's foreign ministry for comment.
Experts say the move could further alienate Kathmandu, which already feels aggrieved by recent Indian actions. 
Nepal was furious in 2019 when India published a map, including some of the areas claimed by Kathmandu in the western region, close to the border with China. 
The diplomatic wrangle escalated after Nepal also published its own map including those disputed areas.
A few years before the map controversy, the ethnic Madhesi community in Nepal had blocked goods traffic from India as part of its 2015 protests for more rights. Though India denied it was behind the economic blockade, very few people in Nepal believed the denial.
In a playground outside Kathmandu, an instructor was making dozens of young men go through their paces as part of a training programme for the forthcoming Gurkha recruitment to the British army. 
Some of them, like Aneesh Thapa Magar, 19, were hoping to join the Indian military - as many of his relatives did.
""The Agnipath programme is of no use to us. After four years, we will return home without knowing what to do next. That's why I am now practising hard to get selected for the British army,"" Mr Magar says.
The Gurkhas have a strong bond with the Indian military, and Gurkha regiments have become part of the culture of the Nepali hill communities.  
There are about 120,000 Indian Gurkha veterans living in Nepal. Their pension and other benefits have contributed to the economy of the impoverished hill regions.
Despite the stiff opposition, not everyone is resistant to the new hiring scheme. Nepalese Indian Gurkha veterans like Laxmikant Pandey argue that the Agnipath scheme has its advantages and should not be rejected outright. 
""The scheme offers a lumpsum amount at the end of the tenure and the Indian military experience will open up many other opportunities in Nepal and abroad,"" he said.
The best option, he suggests, is to open up a dialogue with Delhi to get more concessions.
In the meantime, the first batch of Indian soldiers who signed up for the Agnipath scheme have joined the army, after completing their training courses in the first week of August.

France to ban female students from wearing abayas in state schools,"Pupils will be banned from wearing abayas, loose-fitting full-length robes worn by some Muslim women, in France's state-run schools, the education minister has said.
The rule will be applied as soon as the new school year starts on 4 September.
France has a strict ban on religious signs in state schools and government buildings, arguing that they violate secular laws.
Wearing a headscarf has been banned since 2004 in state-run schools. 
""When you walk into a classroom, you shouldn't be able to identify the pupils' religion just by looking at them,"" Education Minister Gabriel Attal told France's TF1 TV, adding: ""I have decided that the abaya could no longer be worn in schools."" 
The move comes after months of debate over the wearing of abayas in French schools.
The garment is being increasingly worn in schools, leading to a political divide over them, with right-wing parties pushing for a ban while those on the left have voiced concerns for the rights of Muslim women and girls.
""Secularism means the freedom to emancipate oneself through school,"" Mr Attal told TF1, arguing the abaya is ""a religious gesture, aimed at testing the resistance of the republic toward the secular sanctuary that school must constitute.""
He said that he would give clear rules at the national level before schools open after the summer break.
In 2010, France banned the wearing of full face veils in public which provoked anger in France's five million-strong Muslim community.
France has enforced a strict ban on religious signs at schools since the 19th Century, including Christian symbols such as large crosses, in an effort to curb any Catholic influence from public education.
It has been updating the law over the years to reflect its changing population, which now includes the Muslim headscarf and Jewish kippa, but abayas have not been banned outright.

The debate on Islamic symbols has intensified since a Chechen refugee beheaded teacher Samuel Paty, who had shown students caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed, near his school in a Paris suburb in 2020.
The announcement is the first major policy decision by Mr Attal, who was appointed France's education minister by President Emmanuel Macron this summer at the age of 34.
The CFCM, a national body representing many Muslim associations, has said items of clothing alone were not ""a religious sign"".

A vigil has been held in memory of the four young people who died in a car crash in Clonmel, County Tipperary
Brother and sister Luke McSweeney, 24, and Grace McSweeney, 18, died along with 18-year-olds Nicole Murphy and Zoey Coffey
The three teenagers were on their way to meet friends to celebrate receiving exam results
A principal at a school two of the victims attended says the town has been ""covered in a cloud of sadness and devastation""
Thousands of people have attended a vigil in memory of four young people who died in a car crash in Clonmel, County Tipperary, on Friday.
Brother and sister Luke McSweeney, 24, and Grace McSweeney, 18, died in the crash along with 18-year-olds Nicole Murphy and Zoey Coffey.
The three teenagers were on their way to meet friends to celebrate receiving Leaving Cert exam results.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ understands that the car, which had been travelling downhill, lost control and overturned.
Earlier on Sunday, Mass services honoured the four deceased and dozens of people lay flowers at the scene of the crash.
Hundreds gathered at Kickham Plaza in Clonmel for a prayer vigil
Up to 2,000 people are estimated to have gathered at Kickham Plaza in Clonmel on Sunday evening, RTÉ reports.
Among those in attendance were classmates of Ms McSweeney, Ms Coffey and Ms Murphy.
The event was attended by the Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, Alphonsus Cullinan, and was led by the Mayor of Clonmel, Cllr Richie Molloy, and local clergy.
Fr Michael Toomey said the community had been left ""speechless""
Fr Michael Toomey said everyone in Clonmel had been left speechless by the tragedy which had sent ""shockwaves right across our family, our schools, our town, our country"".
Addressing young people in the crowd, the priest said he expects many of them are going through ""shock or pain or denial"".
He said that some people will be struggling to make sense of it, and urged people in the community to ""stick together"" in the time ahead.
Members of the National Ambulance Service were among those gathered at the vigil
Bishop Cullinan said it was ""amazing to see so many"" people attending the vigil, adding that there was a ""goodness"" in the coming together of people.
He said people would support one another in the coming days and ""find a strength in that"". 
The vigil closed with the playing of the song Rise Up by Andra Day, prompting tears from students in the crowd.
Mourners were urged to ""stick together"" in the time ahead
On Saturday, two school principals have paid tribute to the students who received their exam results hours before the crash.
Michael O'Loughlin, from Presentation Secondary School which Ms Coffey and Ms McSweeney had attended, said a day of celebration had been replaced by ""unbearable grief and a great sense of loss"".
He said the school and town are ""covered in a cloud of sadness and devastation"" after the deaths of the students who were ""loved by everybody who met them"".
Michael O'Loughlin and Anne McGrath paid tributes to their former pupils
Anne McGrath, principal of Loreto Secondary School which Ms Murphy had attended, said she had been ""looking forward with excitement to starting the next phase of her young life"".
The principal described her as a ""beautiful student"" who was ""highly regarded by staff and students alike"".
""No words can express our sorrow, pain and grief.""
Flowers have been placed at the scene of the crash
In a statement, CBS High School said it was devastated at the death of past pupil Luke McSweeney.
Fr Michael Toomey, a chaplain at the school, described Mr McSweeney as a ""quiet young man"", and a rugby player with ""a great sense of humour"".
CBS added that it was supporting Mr McSweeney's younger brother, as well as the brother of Ms Murphy.
On Saturday, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and the President of Ireland, Michael D Higgins, led tributes to the deceased.
The taoiseach offered his condolences to the families and friends of those killed, as well as the wider community of Clonmel.
""The thoughts of the whole country are with them, their school and their community,"" Mr Varadkar said.
President Higgins said the ""hearts of all parents and relatives, indeed the whole community"" will have gone out to the victims' families.
He added that ""the grief that has been expressed by the community is nearly unbearable"".
On Sunday morning, students attended Loreto and Presentation Secondary School to mourn and pray together.
Irish Education Minister Norma Foley has pledged ""essential"" support for students and staff ""over the coming period"".
""I'm very conscious that the class of 2023 have technically moved on from the school but it is so important that they would know that the school continues to be there for them... the supports will be ongoing as they're required.""

Man's triathlon death marked with Stourbridge minute's silence,"The death of a swimmer in an Ironman race has left colleagues at the company where he worked in ""absolute shock"", one of them said.
Brendan Wall was one of two swimmers who died in the event in the Republic of Ireland on 20 August.
The 45-year-old worked at Top Tubes in Wednesbury, West Midlands, and the firm's managing director April Pearson-Myatt said he was ""a likeable guy"".
A minute's silence was held by players before a football match on Sunday.
""He was charismatic, he was a great leader,"" Ms Pearson-Myatt said. 
""It's just absolute shock. He'd only been with us for a short period of time.
""Brendan was part of that family already, he was a likeable guy, just a proper gentleman.""
A minute's silence was held in the cup match between Stourbridge FC Women and York City as the firm sponsors both Stourbridge's men's and women's teams.
Stourbridge FC's chairman Andy Pountney said the silence was ""to show our appreciation for his support to us"".
He added he spoke to Mr Wall about a fortnight ago and they were arranging to meet for some drinks ""so unfortunately circumstances have changed that"".
A vigil was held on Thursday in Youghal in County Cork to remember the two men who died - Mr Wall and Ivan Chittenden from Canada.
Both men got into difficulty in the swim element of the half Ironman triathlon event at Claycastle beach.

Hallstatt: Austrian town protests against mass tourism,"Locals in the Austrian town of Hallstatt have taken part in a protest against mass tourism.
Hallstatt, which is a World Heritage Site, has just over 700 inhabitants - but gets up to as many as 10,000 visitors a day during high season.
Residents are calling for limits on the number of daily tourists, and for a ban on tour buses after 17:00 local time.
While tourism has been good for Hallstatt's economy, some locals say there are simply too many visitors.
Hallstatt, with its picturesque old houses on the shores of a pristine Alpine lake surrounded by craggy mountains, has become a tourism hotspot in recent years.
In 2006, it featured in a South Korean romantic drama - boosting its popularity in Asia - with a replica of the town being built in China six years later.
Many visitors come in search of the perfect selfie, with the lake, the slim pale grey church tower and the stunning mountain scenery as a backdrop.
As one of Europe's most over-touristed destinations some locals say there are simply too many visitors, especially day trippers, who are bused into town in large coaches.
For now, like Venice and other places affected by what's known as over-tourism, it looks as if Hallstatt will have to endure the mixed blessings of its popularity.
In May this year, residents briefly erected a wooden wall on the most popular spot to take selfies, blocking the view of the Alps, in protest against noise pollution and traffic. After a backlash on social media, it was removed.  
Back then, the mayor of the town said he wanted to reduce the number of buses that pass through Hallstatt by a third. 
Hallstatt received about a million visitors a year before the Covid-19 pandemic.

In pictures: Redheads celebrate fiery locks at Dutch festival,"Hundreds of redheads from around the world have gathered in the southern Dutch town of Tilburg for an annual festival celebrating their amber locks.
Natural redheads from countries including the UK, Israel, Germany, Italy and New Zealand made the trip for the three-day event, which organisers Redhead Days say is all about ""connection, pride and recognition"".
The festival was founded in 2005 by Bart Rouwenhorst who, rather surprisingly, is blond. 
The amateur painter found himself drawn to the aesthetic qualities of redheads, so advertised for 15 ginger models to paint - only to be deluged with 150 responses.
They were all photographed -  but when many of those who did not get selected voiced their disappointment, Mr Rouwenhorst decided to make an annual event of it.
In 2013, Redhead Days festival-goers made it into the Guinness Book of World Records when 1,672 people got together in the largest recorded gathering of people with natural red hair.

Jacksonville shooting: Racist gunman kills three black people in Florida store,"This video can not be played
Watch: Jacksonville shootings: 'He hated black people'
A gunman killed three black people in a racially motivated attack then killed himself in Jacksonville, Florida, the city's sheriff said.
The man, described as white and in his early 20s, entered a Dollar General store and opened fire, triggering a standoff with police.
Sheriff T K Waters said two men and a woman were killed by the gunman, who wore body armour and left manifestos.
Mayor Donna Deegan said it was a ""hate-filled crime"" driven by racist hatred.
The sheriff said the shooter - who has not yet been officially named - carried a lightweight semi-automatic rifle and a handgun.
He is believed to have acted alone and allegedly wanted to kill himself. He lived in Jacksonville's Clay County with his parents and left several messages about his intentions, Sheriff Waters said, including one to his parents and another to the media. The sheriff added that at least one of the guns had a swastika drawn on it.
The FBI has opened a civil rights investigation into the shooting, which it is treating as a hate crime.
The attack happened less than a mile from the historically black Edwards Waters University. 
The shooter first went to the university campus, where he was asked to identify himself by a security officer, the university said in a statement. When he refused, he was asked to leave.
""The individual returned to their car and left campus without incident,"" the statement added.
Sheriff Waters said the gunman was then seen putting on a bullet-resistant vest and a mask before leaving the campus. 
The university went into lockdown after the shooting.
Jacksonville Mayor Donna Deegan told local TV channel WJXT: ""One shooting is too much but these mass shootings are really hard to take.""
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the gunman a ""scumbag"" and described the shooting as ""horrific"".
""He [the gunman] was targeting people based on their race, that is totally unacceptable,"" said Mr DeSantis, who is competing to be the Republican party's presidential candidate. 
""This guy killed himself rather than face the music and accept responsibility for his actions and so he took the coward's way out.""
The White House said President Joe Biden had been briefed on the shooting.
In a statement provided to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, Dollar General said it was ""heartbroken by the senseless act of violence that occurred at our Kings Road store"", adding that ""supporting our Jacksonville employees and the DG family impacted by this tragedy is a top priority as we work closely with law enforcement"".
There have been over 28,000 gun deaths in the US so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive website.
The Jacksonville attack comes on the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington and Martin Luther King Jr's famous ""I have a dream"" speech. Tens of thousands of people gathered in the capital on Saturday to mark the historic milestone in the civil rights movement.

Emmerson Mnangagwa: 'The Crocodile' wins second term as Zimbabwe president,"Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been elected to a second term with 52.6% of the vote, the electoral commission says.
But the opposition also claimed to have won, saying there was widespread vote-rigging, and observers said the vote fell short of democratic standards.
Mr Mnangagwa is only Zimbabwe's third president. A 2017 coup against veteran ruler Robert Mugabe put him in charge.
Zimbabweans still face high inflation, poverty and a climate of fear.
When he first became president, Mr Mnangagwa - known as ""The Crocodile"" for his ruthlessness - promised a new start for his country's people. 
But Zimbabwe had one of the highest inflation rates in the world last month - prices in July had rocketed by 101.3% since the previous year. Unemployment also remains rife, with only 25% of Zimbabweans holding formal jobs.
Mr Mnangagwa's vow to guarantee human rights also appears hollow, with little changing in this regard since Mr Mugabe's departure.
Critics say the 80-year-old silenced dissent and clamped down on the opposition in the run-up to the vote, which he had been widely-expected to win.
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) said Mr Mnangagwa's main challenger, Citizens' Coalition for Change (CCC) candidate Nelson Chamisa, secured 44% of the vote.
Mr Mnangagwa received more than 2.3m votes, while Mr Chamisa took 1.9m, according to the ZEC. Voter turnout in the country of almost 16m was 69%, the electoral body said.
But Mr Chamisa said that the opposition had the ""real results"" and that there had been many irregularities.
""We have won this election. We are the leaders. We are even surprised why Mnangagwa has been declared a leader,"" he told journalists in Harare.
A spokesperson for the CCC posted on X - formerly known as Twitter - that the party rejected ""any result hastily assembled without proper verification"".
Observer missions from the EU, Commonwealth and 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) said they had a number of concerns with the vote, including the banning of opposition rallies, issues with the electoral register, biased state media coverage and voter intimidation.
""The elections were fraught with irregularities and aggrieved the people of Zimbabwe,"" political analyst Rejoice Ngwenya told AFP.
The run-up to the election was largely free of violence, but CCC members were convicted on what they describe as fabricated charges aimed at weakening the party. The party says the police have banned several of its meetings since July, and nearly 100 gatherings since it was formed in January last year.
Earlier this month, 40 CCC members, including a parliamentary candidate, were arrested while campaigning in the capital Harare. 
The recent killing of a CCC backer, allegedly by supporters of Mr Mnangagwa's Zanu-PF party, further raised concerns about rights.
Critics continue to be arrested and taken to court for insulting the president - an offence punishable by one year in jail or a fine or both. A man in Harare was charged in April after allegedly being overheard by a police officer saying that Mr Mnangagwa would lose the next election.
""The Crocodile"", as he is known, has a fearsome reputation that was cemented after independence during the civil war that broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. 
As national security minister, Mr Mnangagwa was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu.
Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF.
Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres. As president he has tried to broach reconciliation. Some have felt his comments glib given the deep wounds in Matabeleland, but an initiative to allow exhumations and reburials has been agreed.
Voting in the presidential and parliamentary elections was meant to take place on Wednesday, but was extended into Thursday in some areas due to the late distribution of ballot papers.
Mr Mnangagwa's election means Zanu-PF has ruled Zimbabwe for 43 years, since the country gained independence from British rule in 1980.
The party was also declared the winner in the parliamentary race, securing 136 of 210 seats, with the CCC taking 73. A further 60 seats are reserved for women and are appointed through proportional representation.

What we know about Russia plane crash that reportedly killed Prigozhin,"This video can not be played
Watch: Prigozhin, from hot dog seller to mercenary group leader
Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is confirmed to have died in a plane crash north of Moscow following DNA testing of the bodies found in the wreckage, Russia's investigative committee says.
He had earlier been presumed dead after being named on the private jet's passenger list by Russian aviation authorities.
A key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, his private military company has played a key role in Ukraine following Moscow's invasion in February 2022.
But his relationship with Mr Putin soured after Prigozhin ordered his troops to march on Moscow in a day-long rebellion against Russia's military leaders in June. 
The details of the crash are still emerging but here is what we know so far.
Russian aviation officials confirmed the aircraft, an Embraer Legacy, had been flying between Moscow and St Petersburg when it crashed in the Tver region, north of Moscow on Wednesday evening.
But Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone reported the jet had been shot down by the Russian military - although it provided no evidence to support its claim.
The private jet was carrying seven passengers and three crew.
According to preliminary information, all 10 people on board were killed. All the bodies are said to have been recovered.
The Embraer Legacy - registered to one of Prigozhin's companies - caught fire on hitting the ground having reportedly been in the air for less than half an hour. 
Video footage verified by the BBC showed an aircraft falling from the sky in Kuzhenkino, Russia.
Grey Zone reports that a second business jet owned by Prigozhin landed safely in the Moscow region.
The private jet that crashed was carrying seven passengers and three crew.
Russia's aviation agency identified the seven passengers as: Prigozhin and his right-hand man Dmitry Utkin, Sergei Propustin, Yevgeny Makaryan, Alexander Totmin, Valery Chekalov and Nikolai Matuseyev.
The crew members were identified as Captain Alexei Levshin, co-pilot Rustam Karimov and flight attendant Kristina Raspopova. 
The private jet was believed to have been en route from Moscow to St Petersburg when it came down around 60 miles north of the Russian capital. 
Since his short-lived mutiny against Russia's top military commanders, whom he had repeatedly criticised for their strategy in Ukraine, Prigozhin had kept a relatively low profile. 
Under a deal to end the rebellion, charges against him were dropped on the understanding that he relocate to Belarus. 
He appeared to do so, albeit briefly, and on his own terms. 
In mid-July, a video that appeared on Telegram channels appeared to show Prigozhin welcoming fighters in Belarus.
But later that month, he was photographed in the Russian city of St Petersburg during the Africa-Russia summit.
In the past week, Prigozhin released his first video statement since June's abortive rebellion, which suggested he was in Africa.
The BBC has not been able to verify where that video was filmed. 
After Grey Zone reported that he had died, Russia's aviation agency released what it said was a confirmed list of those on board the aircraft that went down in the Tver region just north of Moscow. 
Prigozhin's name is on it. 
According to Russia's investigative committee, a criminal investigation has been launched into the cause of the crash under Article 263 of Russia's criminal code, which governs traffic safety and the operation of air transport. 
Meanwhile, emergency services have finished their search of the site. 
The governor of the Tver region, Igor Rudenya, has reportedly taken control of the investigation.

Wagner boss Prigozhin confirmed dead in plane crash - Moscow,"Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin has been confirmed dead after genetic analysis of bodies found in Wednesday's plane crash, Russian officials say.
The Investigative Committee (SK) said the identities of all 10 victims had been established and corresponded to those on the flight's passenger list.
Prigozhin's private jet came down north-west of Moscow on 23 August, killing all those on board.
The Kremlin has denied speculation it was to blame for the crash.
The SK said it was continuing a criminal investigation.
""Molecular-genetic testing has been completed,"" it said in a statement.
""According to its results, the identities of all 10 deceased have been established, and they correspond to the list published in the flight manifest.""
The victims include several senior figures in Wagner, a Russian mercenary group set up by Prigozhin and involved in military operations in Ukraine, Syria and parts of Africa.
Among them was Dmitry Utkin, who managed Wagner's military operations.
The others on the Embraer Legacy plane - flying from Moscow to St Petersburg - included Wagner members Valery Chekalov, Sergei Propustin, Yevgeny Makaryan, Alexander Totmin and Nikolay Matuseyev.
The plane was flown by pilot Alexei Levshin and co-pilot Rustam Karimov, and there was one flight attendant, Kristina Raspopova.
The crash came two months after Prigozhin led a Wagner mutiny against the Russian armed forces, seizing the southern city of Rostov and threatening to march on Moscow.
The standoff was defused after a deal was reached which led to Prigozhin and Wagner fighters relocating to Belarus.
However, Russian President Vladimir Putin described the mutiny as a ""stab in the back"" and there has been speculation that Russian security forces were somehow involved in the crash.
US officials quoted by CBS have said that the most likely cause of the crash was an explosion on board the plane, and the Pentagon said Prigozhin was probably killed.
On Friday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said rumours of foul play were an ""absolute lie"".
Mr Putin has sent his condolences to the families of the victims.
He described Prigozhin as a ""talented person"" who ""made serious mistakes in life"".

Afghanistan: Taliban ban women from visiting popular national park,"The Taliban government have banned women from visiting the Band-e-Amir national park in Bamiyan province.
Afghanistan's acting minister of virtue and vice, Mohammad Khaled Hanafi, said women had not been observing hijab inside the park.
He called on religious clerics and security agencies to forbid women from entering until a solution was found.
Band-e-Amir is a significant tourist attraction, becoming Afghanistan's first national park in 2009.
It is a popular destination for families and the ban on women attending will prevent many from being able to enjoy the park. 
Unesco describes the park as a ""naturally created group of lakes with special geological formations and structure, as well as natural and unique beauty"".
However, Mr Hanafi said going to the park to sightsee ""was not obligatory"", Afghan agency Tolo News reported.
Religious clerics in Bamiyan said the women who were visiting the park and not following the rules were visitors to the area.
""There are complaints about lack of hijab or bad hijab, these are not Bamiyan residents. They come here from other places,"" Sayed Nasrullah Waezi, head of the Bamiyan Shia Ulema Council told Tolo news.
Afghan former MP Mariam Solaimankhil shared a poem she had written on X, formerly known as Twitter, about the ban and wrote ""we'll return, I'm sure of it"".
Fereshta Abbasi, of Human Rights Watch, noted women had been banned from visiting the park on Women's Equality Day and wrote it was a ""total disrespect to the women of Afghanistan"". 
Meanwhile Richard Bennett, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, asked why stopping women from visiting Band-e-Amir ""is necessary to comply with Sharia and Afghan culture?"".
The Taliban have a history of implementing bans on women doing certain activities on what it insists is a temporary basis, including preventing them from attending schools in December 2022. 
The ban on visiting the Band-E-Amir national park is the latest in a long list of activities that women have been prevented from doing since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. 
Most recently, the Taliban ordered hair and beauty salons in Afghanistan to shut and in mid-July stopped women from sitting the national university entrance exams.

Romania explosion: Huge blasts at fuel station kill two and injure dozens,"This video can not be played
Watch: Footage shows moment of devastating Romanian explosion
At least two people died and 56 were injured after two blasts at a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) station in Romania.
The injured included 39 firefighters who went to the scene following the first explosion near the capital Bucharest on Saturday evening.
Shortly after, a second blast sent a mushroom cloud billowing into the sky, rocking the forecourt in Crevedia.
Several people are in critical condition with severe burns, authorities said. 
The two people who died were a couple, Raed Arafat, the head of Romania's emergency department, told reporters on Sunday.
They sent four people who were injured, including two firefighters, to hospitals abroad and said others would follow.
Two police officers and two gendarmes are among the injured.
Authorities do not yet know what caused the blast. Mr Arafat said the station was no longer in use and ""did not have a permit to function"", according to quotes reported by the Agence France-Presse news agency.
People within a 700-metre (almost half a mile) radius were initially evacuated from the area, with Mr Arafat warning there was a risk of another explosion.
But by mid-morning, the fires had been contained.
Romania's President Klaus Iohannis described the explosions as a ""tragedy"" and said he was ""profoundly saddened"" by what had happened. 
""An investigation must quickly be launched to see if rules were broken. I ask the authorities to take urgent measures for the injured so that these tragedies won't happen again,"" he wrote on Facebook.

Trump campaign raises $7.1m following historic Georgia mugshot,"Donald Trump's election campaign says it has raised $7.1m (£5.6m) since his police mugshot was taken at a prison in Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday.
Much of the money comes from merchandise such as mugs, T-shirts and drink coolers bearing the former president's scowling face.
Mr Trump was released on bail, charged with plotting to overturn the state's 2020 election results.
He faces three other indictments as he campaigns for the 2024 US election.
They include two related to his false claims that the election was stolen and the attack by his followers on the Capitol in Washington.
Mr Trump denies all the charges and argues the cases against him are politically motivated because he is leading the race for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Party incumbent President Joe Biden.
The attention seems to have galvanised his supporters, and he has raised almost $20m in three weeks, since his indictments in the Georgia and Capitol riots cases.
On Friday, immediately after his arrest in Georgia, he raised $4.18m, said to be his highest figure in a 24-hour period in the campaign so far.
As well as selling merchandise from its online store, the campaign has been messaging supporters asking for help.
And on Thursday, Mr Trump himself posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, for the first time since January 2021, sharing the mugshot with the caption ""Election interference. Never surrender!"" and the address of his website.
This came after the former president was photographed at Fulton County jail, where he surrendered to law enforcement and paid $200,000 to be released as he awaits trial.

"Bob Barker, who hosted The Price Is Right for 35 years, dies aged 99","Bob Barker, who hosted the US game show The Price Is Right for 35 years, has died at the age of 99.
The Price is Right is the longest-running game show on US television and is watched every weekday by audiences in other countries. 
Barker was its smiling face from the first series in 1972 until 2007. He won 19 Emmy awards during a radio and TV career that spanned six decades. 
He died of natural causes at his home near Los Angeles, his agent said.
""The World's Greatest MC [Master of Ceremonies] who ever lived, Bob Barker, has left us,"" publicist Roger Neal said in a statement on Saturday.
Barker was born in December 1923 in Washington State and joined the US Navy during World War Two, before starting a career in radio, and later TV.
In CBS's The Price Is Right, excited contestants were famously invited to ""come on down"" before Barker tested their knowledge of the price of consumer items in return for prizes.
In 2007, aged 83, he was succeeded as host by comedian Drew Carey.
When Barker's death was first reported, Carey tweeted: ""There hasn't been a day on set that I didn't think of Bob Barker and thank him. I will carry his memory in my heart forever."" 
Hollywood actor Adam Sandler also paid tribute to his Happy Gilmore co-star, saying Barker was ""The man. The myth. The best"" and that he would be ""missed by everyone"". 
Fellow actor James Woods also praised Barker, highlighting his ""greatest contribution"" as an advocate for animal rights. 
Woods said as well as being a world famous game show host, Barker's ""love for our furry friends inspired compassionate movements all over the world"". 
Animal rights group Peta said Barker would be remembered for his ""lifelong work for animals"" and that he was committed to pushing for the end of animal exploitation in ""every way"". 
Barker was a vegetarian for more than 40 years, and repeatedly spoke out about animal cruelty and donated money to animal rights work.

Three US marines killed in Australia helicopter crash,"Three US marines have been killed and 20 injured after a military helicopter crashed during exercises in Australia.
The MV-22B Osprey came down on its way to the remote Tiwi islands north of Darwin. Five of the marines are said to be in a serious condition.
They were taking part in Predators Run, involving 2,500 troops from the US, Australia, the Philippines, East Timor and Indonesia.
Only US personnel were on board the aircraft.
The incident took place on Melville Island north of the Northern Territory capital Darwin on Sunday.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the incident as tragic and said every assistance would be given to the injured.
""Five marines have been returned to Darwin for treatment with the remaining being triaged at the scene,"" said local police commissioner Michael Murphy.
""Additional police and defence personnel have been deployed to Melville Island to support operations, triage injured people and return them to Darwin and also maintain the crash scene while investigations continue.""
The incident is the second fatal helicopter crash during joint exercises in northern Australia in less than a month.
On 29 July four Australian soldiers were presumed dead after their 45 MRH-90 Taipan crashed off the coast of Queensland while participating in Exercise Talisman Sabre, the largest bilateral military training exercise between Australia and the US.
The Osprey is a hybrid combining features of helicopters and turbo-prop planes which can travel much faster than a conventional helicopter.
But it has a troubled history, with a fatal crash in Norway last year killing four marines. Three others died in 2017 when their aircraft clipped the back of a transport ship off northern Australia.

Aberdare: The park murder that may have had Hitler links,"It was a frenzied murder which left locals too scared to leave their homes.
The victim was brutally stabbed 44 times, robbed, and his body dumped in the flowerbeds at Aberdare park one evening in April 1948.
Scotland Yard would send in their top man to investigate, but even he would fail to find the killer.
Meanwhile, the shocked south Wales valleys community abounded with rumours that the slaying might have been connected to Hitler and his Nazis.
The dead man's name was Jerzy Strzadala, although many who grew to know the well-liked Polish immigrant would simply refer to him as George.
He arrived from his homeland after WWII ended and began working at a colliery in Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taf.        
Said to have been friendly and polite to all, the 33-year-old was discovered in rhododendron shrubbery the following morning by three young boys on their way to school.
The coroner was alerted and police barricades quickly set up around the grisly scene.
As a result, those living in the area started bolting their doors in fear.
Others vowed to stay well away from the popular park altogether. 
News of the murder eventually attracted the attention of Scotland Yard, whose famed chief inspector Robert Honey Fabian set up a base at one of the town's hotels to investigate.
Fabian, or RH as he was known, was something of a celebrity due to his cracking of some recent high profile crimes in London - one of which was a murder case so controversial it would eventually lead to the death penalty being abolished.       
However, despite the excitement caused by his arrival, progress in finding the murderer proved painfully slow.   
Even the use of ground breaking new technology - a top of the range metal detector - failed to uncover the discarded murder weapon.
The park's lake was also dredged in the hope a clue would lie buried in the silt beneath its surface, but with no luck.
Meanwhile, hundreds of door-to-door inquiries proved equally fruitless, despite some purporting to have seen a ""short and thick set man aged in his late 20s"" in the park around the time Strzadala had been set upon.
Indeed, Fabian's investigation would be dogged by all manner of frustrating dead-ends.  
The area's large contingent of eastern European mine workers - some of whom had been staying at the same hostel as Strzadala - spoke little English, making police interviews difficult.      
Meanwhile, clothing found near the pit where the victim had worked  - a waistcoat and trousers - would prove briefly tantalising.
But instead of having been dumped by the killer, as hoped, the garments were deemed in too good a state to have been involved in such a vicious attack.                
Similarly the ace detective's spirits were buoyed when some blood-stained banknotes were stumbled upon.
Yet again though, nothing came of it. 
Some doubted the blood had been Strzadala's at all, instead suggesting that the cash had simply passed through the unwashed hands of staff at the local butcher shop.
Nevertheless, there is no record of what happened after the money was sent off for forensic testing.
What some did believe, however, was that the conflict in Europe had some part to play in Strzadala's death.
Whispers at the time suggested that the other man seen in Aberdare Park on that fateful night had also been Polish.
Some with relatives who had been alive in the area during the 40s remember talk of how the two had somehow recognised each other from the war. 
The inference was that Strzadala possibly colluded with the Nazis during the fighting and had been recognised and approached by his countryman.
That said, there are those who believe it was the other man who had been confronted by Strzadala for having sided with Hitler's fascists.
Posting on the A Bit of Old Aberdare Facebook page one person said: ""There was a theory it was espionage-related, or an old grudge carried over from Poland.""
Another said they had spoken to their elderly father about the murder and he remembered the door to door inquiries and the rumours of how either Strzadala or his killer had worked as ""a guard in a POW camp"".
So was it a revenge killing?
Unfortunately we may never know the truth, the murder having gone unsolved to this day - despite South Wales Police announcing in 2009 that the cold case was one of several being kept open for review.
But for RH Fabian it would prove among the few times in a long and glittering career in which he failed to get his man.
He would retire from the force the following year knowing Jerzy Strzadala's killer was still out there somewhere.   
And while that man's identity remains unknown, the motive behind the crime seems to offer up an even darker mystery.

Rome authorities tackle Colosseum rat infestation,"Authorities in Rome are taking action to tackle an infestation of rats around the Colosseum.  
Tourists have posted videos on social media showing the rodents roaming close to the ancient amphitheatre. 
The city's head of refuse collection, Sabrina Alfonsi, said there had been an ""extraordinary intervention"" over the weekend by workers clearing rubbish and placing traps. 
Ms Alfonsi said the rats were attracted to piles of litter left by tourists.
Recent heatwaves had compounded the problem, with large amounts of plastic bottles discarded around the monument, she added.
The situation was now under control, she said, but the operation will continue next week with workers cleaning up the green areas surrounding the Colosseum and the drains where the rats are common. 
Officials say there are about seven million rats in Rome, about two-and-a-half for every city resident.
The city has also for a number of years been struggling to cope with quantities of waste, with bins often left to overflow and piles of rubbish dumped directly onto streets.

"Haiti gang opens fire on protesters in capital, killing seven","A gang in Haiti has shot and killed at least seven people who were marching in a big protest organised by a church leader.
Hundreds of parishioners, some armed with machetes, marched through a suburb of the capital, Port-au-Prince, in a bid to rid the area of gang members.
The gang is said to have opened fire on them with machine guns.
Soaring gang violence in Haiti has left more than 2,400 people dead in 2023 alone.
There are fears the death toll from Saturday's shooting could increase, with several people wounded and others kidnapped.
Reuters news agency says unverified videos on social media showed people being shot at in the street, bodies lying on the ground and people who appeared to be hostages saying they thought the march was peaceful and had no idea it was about taking on the gang.
The protest happened in the suburb of Canaan, which was founded by survivors of the devastating 2010 earthquake.
Canaan is controlled by a gang led by a man identified only as ""Jeff"", who is believed to be allied with the 5 Segonn ""5 Seconds"" gang.
Gédéon Jean, director of Haiti's Center for Analysis and Research in Human Rights, told the Associated Press news agency that he watched the event unfold online and planned to ask the Ministry of Justice to investigate.
He accused the pastor who organised the march of being irresponsible because he ""engaged a group of people and put them in a situation like this"".
""Police should have stopped them from going,"" Mr Jean said. ""It's extremely horrible for the state to let something like this happen.""
Decades of instability, disasters and economic woes have left Haiti one of the poorest and most violent countries in the world.
Gang violence has soared since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021, which led to much of the Caribbean country's territory falling out of government control, so now around 80% of the capital is controlled by gangs.
Turf wars have since driven a surge in refugees, severe food shortages, murders, kidnappings and sexual violence.
UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said that in the year to 15 August, at least 2,439 Haitians had been killed, 902 injured and 951 kidnapped.
Amid the soaring violence Haitians have organised a violent movement known as ""bwa kale"" that targets suspected gang members. More than 350 people have been killed since that uprising began in April, according to the UN.

The indigenous groups fighting against the quest for 'white gold',"""Our land is drying up and our water is polluted,"" says Nati Machaca, one of the protesters manning a roadblock in the village of Purmamarca, high in the Andes mountains. 
Ms Machaca is a spokeswoman for the indigenous groups living in Jujuy, a province in northern Argentina.
Jujuy is located in what has become known as the ""lithium triangle"", a stretch of the Andes straddling the tri-border area between Argentina, Bolivia and Chile, which holds the world's biggest reserves of lithium.
The metal is used to make rechargeable batteries for everything from smartphones to laptops.
It has become especially sought after as electrical cars, which also use lithium in their batteries, are becoming increasingly popular.  
Argentina is the world's number four lithium producer, but some residents of Jujuy say not only are they not benefiting from the industry, but that their way of life is under threat as a result of it.
Lithium extraction requires huge amounts of water - about two million litres per tonne.
And locals like Nati Machaca, who live off the land and raise cattle in this predominantly rural area, fear it is drying the soil and polluting the water.
""If this goes on, we will soon starve and become ill,"" she warns.
The position of the more than 400 indigenous groups inhabiting these mountains is complicated by the fact that many lack legal titles to the land where they have lived for centuries - long before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the 1500s. 
Ms Machaca is a case in point. She lives on a piece of land her grandfather bought from the landowner he worked for. 
""Back then it was all verbal agreements,"" she explains, ""but there's no proof"".
She and many like her, who have no legal documents to back up their claims to the land, could now face eviction under a controversial constitutional reform approved in June by the governor of Jujuy, Gerardo Morales. 
""[Governor] Morales comes after the land because he knows it's where the lithium is,"" says Ms Machaca.
The new constitution also limits the right to protest, but that has not deterred the indigenous communities, who have blocked the roads to the lithium mines.
Police were deployed to remove them, but the protesters say this made them more united and determined.
""We are not moving. The land is ours, the lithium belongs to us,"" they insisted. 
In total, there are 38 lithium mining projects in northern Argentina, of which three are already up and running.
Much of the lithium in this area is located beneath salt flats in the form of lithium brine. 
In order to reach the underground deposits, companies first have to drill. The brine is then pumped to the surface into artificial ponds, where some of the liquid is allowed to evaporate before the lithium is extracted through a series of chemical processes.  
Local communities warn that the impact on the environment of lithium mining is considerable, both because of the huge amounts of water the process requires and the air and water pollution the chemicals used in the extraction can cause.
According to Marie-Pierre Lucesoli though, companies are making great efforts to optimise the use of water, as well as to reduce the use of fossil fuels, with almost all lithium mining plants being planned to work with solar energy. 
Ms Lucesoli is the manager of the chamber of mining in neighbouring Salta, a province which is also rich in lithium, and she is adamant that the processes for obtaining lithium are ""evolving on a daily basis with the aim of becoming more sustainable"". 
But Néstor Jérez, chief of the Ocloya people, remains concerned about the impact current lithium mining is having and future projects could have.
Indigenous groups like the Ocloya seek to live in harmony with Pachamama (Mother Earth), whom they worship in ceremonies. 
And it is from her that Néstor Jérez says they draw the strength to oppose the mining projects: ""She is the guarantor of life, so we will defend her whatever it takes.""
He is not swayed by the argument put forward by Ms Lucesoli, who says that lithium mining generates local employment, and that with it comes educational and training opportunities. 
""Wealth is not only about the economic improvement of the inhabitants, but also about the improvement of the quality of life that will last for many generations,"" she says. 
Feeling their concerns were not being addressed, the indigenous groups set off on a march to the capital, Buenos Aires, to make their demands heard by the national government. 
The march, called ""Malón de la Paz"" (Raid for Peace), is modelled on similar indigenous protests held in 1946 and 2006. 
Those taking part in this third ""Malón de la Paz"" say they are determined not to give in until the constitutional reform backed by Governor Morales is revoked. 
But they stress that their struggle is much wider than for the land they live on. 
""Mining is harming biodiversity and aggravating the climate crisis,"" those marching to the capital said. 
Meanwhile, Ms Lucesoli argues that lithium will contribute towards curbing climate change, as it is a key element in producing the batteries needed to switch from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles. For her, it is part of ""the energy transformation to decarbonise the world"".  
She does concede though that ""the business sector needs to inform the community more"" in order to raise awareness among the people who oppose lithium mining.
But those manning the roadblocks in Jujuy and the many who marched to Buenos Aires insist they will not give up their resistance.
""This is not just for us: it's for the future generations and the entire humanity's well-being.""

Auctioneer exposed by BBC admits illegally selling rare ancient coins,"A British auctioneer who was at the centre of a BBC investigation has pleaded guilty at a New York court to a series of charges in connection with unlawful sales of rare ancient coins.
Richard Beale, director of London-based auction house Roma Numismatics, admitted two counts of conspiracy and three counts of criminal possession of stolen property, court documents show.  
He was accused of falsifying the provenance of the most expensive coin ever auctioned - the gold Eid Mar, which fetched $4.19m (£3.29m) in 2020 - and an ancient silver Sicily Naxos Coin, which sold at the same time for $292,000.
He has also admitted to falsifying the provenance of a number of silver Alexander the Great decadrachms from the ""Gaza Hoard"", which were sold by Roma Numismatics and whose suspicious origin was brought to light by a BBC News Arabic documentary in 2020. 
The investigation documented how, three years earlier, fishermen in the Palestinian territory had discovered dozens of the coins, which date back to the 4th Century BC. Soon after the coins were found, they disappeared.  
""They are in the hands of people who don't know what these [coins] are, why they are here and what they represent for our country. It's very painful,"" Fadel Alatol, a local archaeologist who had identified the coins found by the fishermen before they were presumably sold on, told the BBC in 2019. 
Before the Gaza discovery, only 20 Alexander decadrachms were known to be in existence. A few months later, the same type of coins started to appear for sale at auction houses around the world.
In September 2017, one Alexander decadrachm sold for £100,000 ($127,300) at Roma Numismatics. 
But in total 19 of these, formerly very rare, Alexander decadrachms were sold - 11 of them by Roma Numismatics - with the provenance of the coins listed as either ""from a private Canadian collection"" or ""ex-private European collection"". 
In 2019, the BBC approached Beale at his office in London and challenged him directly about the provenances for the decadrachms listed on Roma Numismatics' auction site.
The BBC informed Beale that it suspected the coins had come from the ""Gaza Hoard"", which meant that it was illegal to sell them. 
Auction houses are expected to carry out due diligence to establish a coin's provenance. However, they are also permitted to rely only on what they are told by a trusted consignor - the technical term for a sender.
In a statement provided to the BBC by Beale at the time, he said: ""We were satisfied that the consignor(s) were known to us, and had an established record of professionalism and trust. Furthermore, we were provided with information that the items had entered the UK from an origin country that raised no concern."" 
Following the meeting with BBC producers, Roma Numismatics went on to sell more Alexander decadrachms. 
Appearing before the New York Supreme Criminal Court on 14 August, Beale admitted that he had known the provenances of the decadrachms were false when they were sold and meant to disguise the fact that they came from the Gaza Hoard, court documents show.
He also admitted that he decided to continue selling the coins despite the producers of the BBC documentary challenging directly about the false provenances on Roma Numismatics' auction site. 
According to the court documents, Beale also admitted that in 2015 he entered into an agreement with an Italian coin dealer to sell the Eid Mar coin, which was minted in 42BC to commemorate the assassination of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March.
The two men travelled to Munich and paid €450,000 ($490,000; £385,000) in cash for the coin, despite it having no provenance paperwork or any other form of documentation. 
In August 2020, Beale shipped the coin to the US to be authenticated and listed its country of origin as ""Turkey"", because any ancient items from Italy or Greece were more likely to be seized by US Customs for checks. 
The following month, the coin was listed for sale by Roma Numismatics and described as coming ""from the collection of the Baron Dominique de Chambrier, original attestation of provenance included"".
In October 2020, Beale received an email and letter from the baron asking him to withdraw the false provenance. But he proceeded with the sale of the coin and an American buyer paid $4.19m.
Judge Althea Drysdale called Beale's actions ""woefully wrong and illegal"", as well as ""harmful to both the buyers and the nations whose cultural property [was] illegally acquired"".
The maximum sentence for these criminal offences is 25 years in prison, but this could be reduced under a plea and sentence agreement with prosecutors. 
Beale is next due to appear before the New York Supreme Criminal Court in March.  
Both the Eid Mar and Sicily Naxos coins were seized by US authorities and repatriated earlier this year to their countries of origin - Greece and Italy.

The indiscriminate devastation of Canada's raging wildfires,"Joanna Kelly is a lawyer in Kelowna, and this week she's been given permission to appear in legal cases by video-link partly because she has very few formal clothes to wear. They, and most of her other possessions, went up in flames last week. 
On her mobile phone, Joanna watches a grainy video of what used to be her house with Duncan Vickers - her friend and neighbour for decades. They're now evacuees in Canada's worst ever wildfire season. 
Joanna says they had never seen anything like the inferno that tore through their Okanagan valley community, in the western province of British Columbia, destroying almost everything in its path, including their homes.  
""It was blindingly bright and then it would get into a house,"" says Joanna, as she describes watching the wall of fire from a vantage point on the other side of the lake. ""There was a raging fire going through a skeleton-like building and it went from one to the next until there were dozens of destroyed structures."" 
Her next-door neighbour Duncan, who emigrated to Canada in the 1970s, lost most of what he had built and owned - including his father's World War Two medals. But, says Duncan, showing some of his native Yorkshire stoicism, his family is safe and everything else has to be put into perspective. 
""I got my cars out, which is important,"" he says. ""It's terrible, but you've got to be philosophical about these things."" 
It's still too dangerous and risky for Duncan, Joanna and other residents who lost their homes to return and pick up the pieces. But, from the vantage point of a boat on the lake, the devastation is clear to see.
What's apparent is the indiscriminate nature of the wildfires. In parts of the waterfront communities, where houses back onto the forests, several homes have been completely destroyed by fire. House after house has been gutted. But then, all of a sudden, you come across buildings only yards away that have been barely touched by the blaze and are completely habitable. 
Via security cameras, streamed to devices or phones in safe locations, some residents could watch and listen, helplessly in real time, as their houses burned. It's a testament to local rescue services that no lives were lost. Jason Brolund is the local fire chief and was on the frontline with his crews in often perilous situations. 
""There were times when our staff were surrounded on all sides by fire,"" says the chief. ""They would not say they were 'trapped' but there's no question it's been dangerous. We saw dramatic fire behaviour, with winds ripping up trees by their roots and laying them down like toothpicks."" 
Most alarmingly, Chief Brolund wonders about how his relatively small department can cope with an ever-expanding fire season. Normally the team would be dealing with a relatively small number of blazes in July and August. Now, he says, they can be fighting wildfires from March to November. 
He and many others with years of experience in this field are in no doubt that the increasing impact of human activity on the environment must bear much of the blame. 
There have been more than 1,000 wildfires across Canada in the last week - a record number. As he toured a local evacuation centre I asked the province's premier, David Eby, if he thought that climate change might be partly responsible for the spike in such incidents.   
""Without a doubt,"" said Mr Eby. ""The ferocity of the fires and the extent of the burning, not just here in British Columbia, are clearly linked to human-caused climate change. We're in the fourth year of drought here and that's making the fires so much worse."" 
The biggest fires may have been tamed, but there is still a significant threat as new seats of fire start up at various places in the tinder-dry forest. I watched as a small team of helicopters swooped over a local lake, scooping up water in huge buckets to try and douse a big fire on the other side of the valley that was clearly of concern to the authorities. 
The helicopters flew and dropped water virtually from dawn till dusk and were back again the next day.   
This crisis has undoubtedly strengthened the bond between the fire crews and a grateful public, who gather at fire houses in Kelowna to cheer home the firemen and firewomen after another exhausting day in the forest. 
But most people here are under no illusion that the number and frequency of wildfires will become more common in the future.

Evidence found of German mass execution by French Resistance after D-Day,"Archaeologists have found evidence of a mass execution of German prisoners who were forced to dig their own graves and then shot by the French Resistance a few days after D-Day, during World War Two.
French and German teams discovered bullets and cartridges, as well as coins, at a remote site in central France identified by the last surviving witness. 
After France surrendered to Hitler's Germany in 1940, the underground Resistance movement gathered force over years of occupation and by June 1944 was poised to help the Allied invasion in Normandy.
The eight-day excavation in wooded hills near the town of Meymac failed to unearth human remains.
""The bodies are definitely there somewhere. We are not going to stop now,"" said Xavier Kompa, head of the French Veterans' Affairs Office in the Corrèze department.
Kompa was speaking at the police checkpoint at the start of the track leading to the site. The site itself remains off-limits to press and public.
The dig has been suspended, but will be resumed after more analysis of the ground and of the finds.
The search follows the recent revelations of 98-year-old former Resistance fighter Edmond Réveil, who broke nearly 80 years of silence to speak about the killings for the first time. 
In an interview with the BBC, Réveil recalled the reaction of the German prisoners when they were told they were to be shot.
""They knew what was coming…. They got out their wallets and looked at (photographs of) their families. There was no crying out. They were soldiers,"" he said.
""They were shot in the chest from a distance of four or five metres.""  
The prisoners - 46 German soldiers and one French woman collaborator - had been ordered to dig their own graves in the form of a long trench. 
Following Réveil's account, French and German officials focused their search on a section of woods near the hamlet of Encaux. Ground-penetrating radar perceived what appeared to be a trench that fitted the description.
However when a 45- by 10-metre area was excavated, it proved fruitless. The teams then switched their attention to an adjacent zone, which had not been analysed with the radar. 
In this area - not yet cleared of trees - they discovered the artefacts that apparently confirmed they were in the right place. 
Twenty bullets as well as bullet-casings are of French, German, American and Swiss manufacture - which would reflect the variety of weaponry used by the Resistance. 
All date from before 1944, as do five coins.
The Corrèze prefecture said that more studies would now be carried out, and ""when new elements allow us to pinpoint the remains, a new effort will be made to exhume them"".
""It is extremely hard to find the exact spot, because the terrain has changed so much,"" said Kompa.
""Back in 1944, this was heathland. The pine trees were planted by the Americans after the war. And the configuration of the paths has changed too.""
Réveil's story triggered massive media interest when it was reported in May. 
""We had no idea the world would focus so much attention,"" said Kompa. ""That's another reason why we are going to keep looking."" 
As an 18-year-old member of the Francs Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) Resistance group, Réveil had taken part in an anti-German uprising in the Corrèze capital of Tulle just after the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944.
The Normandy landings - often referred to as D-Day - saw the Allied forces of the US, UK and Canada begin an attack that lasted for 11 months. It eventually led to the defeat of Nazi Germany and the liberation of occupied Europe.
Days after D-Day, French fighters captured between 50 and 60 German soldiers. But the fighters were then forced to flee into the mountains by the arrival of German reinforcements.
In retaliation for the uprising, on 9 June the SS Das Reich division hanged 99 hostages on the streets of Tulle.
The next day they massacred 643 people in the village of Oradour-sur-Glane, which has remained an empty monument ever since.
Réveil was part of the Resistance escort moving north-east with their captives, taking mountain paths to avoid German patrols.
After three days walking, on 12 June, the commander radioed to headquarters for orders. This was when he was told to have the prisoners shot. Some Czechoslovakian and Polish nationals were spared.
Réveil says that he did not personally take part in the killing.
After the execution, a cloak of silence descended. There was a tacit oath taken by the 30 or so Resistance fighters never to mention it again. 
Réveil decided to speak out only because he was the last person alive to have been a witness.
""It needs to be told. It's been a secret long enough,"" he said to the BBC.
In 1967 - in circumstances that have never been fully explained - there was actually a first excavation at the scene. This unearthed 11 bodies. But the dig seems to have been abruptly stopped, and all official records expunged.
The likely reason is that former members of the Resistance - who were still numerous and influential in French politics - did not wish the episode to be resuscitated for fear of sullying their heroic image.
According to Meymac's mayor Philippe Brugère, such considerations are now long gone.
""The guardians of the memory of the Resistance were fearful it would harm their name. But today no-one wants to cast judgment. People understand that in war all acts become possible.
""You can be on the side of the righteous, and still carry out what is morally wrong.""

Putin and Wagner boss Prigozhin: How a long friendship turned ugly,"Theirs was a relationship borne out of the murky world where Russia's state security services mingled with the criminal underworld. 
While Yevgeny Prigozhin's Wagner military company grew into one of the most influential structures in Russia, Vladimir Putin became increasingly dependent on its battlefield successes in Ukraine.
But it was in the seedy scene of early 1990s St Petersburg that their paths first met, during the politically fraught years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Both men originate from Russia's second city and cultural capital.
Home to the Hermitage art museum and Imperial Winter Palace, it is also considered the crime capital of Russia and a base for powerful gangs. 
The exact circumstances of their first encounter are unknown, but Prigozhin was fresh out of jail and Mr Putin had recently returned from a mission in East Germany as an officer with the Soviet security service, the KGB, and was looking for a way into politics.
Convicted for the first time at 17, Prigozhin was no stranger to crime. After a suspended sentence for theft in the late 1970s, he was given a lengthy jail term for robbery in 1981.
He and two others had grabbed a woman by the neck in the street and tried to strangle her, before running off with her winter boots and earrings.
When he left prison in 1990, Russia was a very different place. Instead of the old Soviet chief, Leonid Brezhnev, reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev was in power, the Berlin Wall had fallen and perestroika (restructuring) was well under way.
Prigozhin started out as a St Petersburg hot-dog salesman, but by the mid-1990s he had opened a restaurant. The Old Custom House is most likely the place the two men first met.
The menu of foie gras and oysters attracted local crime bosses as well as the city's powerful mayor, Anatoly Sobchak. Vladimir Putin, then aged 40, went there too as Sobchak's deputy.
Prigozhin's single restaurant became a chain and his clientele included politicians from far beyond St Petersburg.
By the turn of the century, when Mr Putin became president, the two men had become close associates and Prigozhin's nickname, Putin's chef, dates back to this time.
A photo shows Prigozhin serving dinner to him and President George W Bush.
For a man such as Russia's new leader, it was imperative to have a personal chef to ensure his food was safe to consume. 
Ever the suspicious KGB mind, he had also served as the head of its successor, the FSB.
It was also convenient to have a man whose innermost secrets he would have known and whom he could influence.
With Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin, Russia's security services slowly began to take back control. Prigozhin took on a variety of Kremlin tasks, particularly those beyond the security services' reach.
Their association was now at arm's length, so the man in the Kremlin could plausibly deny involvement.
Prigozhin set up a media empire focused on spreading disinformation within Russia and abroad. The stories it invented were often so fantastical that no state propaganda apparatus would dare to spread them. 
As social media began to gain influence, he set up a ""troll factory"" whose main effect was to leave Russians with the feeling there was no such thing as truth and no point looking for it.
It took another decade before he admitted to being the brains behind the ""Internet Research Agency"".
After the Ukrainian Maidan Revolution in 2013-14 and Russia's annexation of Crimea, the first reports of the Wagner private military company surfaced. Wagner supported pro-Russian separatists in Crimea and in the east of Ukraine. 
Mercenary organisations are banned by Russian law, even though Prigozhin and his mercenaries had become increasingly important for stamping President Putin's authority.
So until as late as spring 2022, the Kremlin maintained that it had no connection to him.
Wagner also played a prominent role in Syria - and this is when its ruthless commander, Dmitry Utkin, first came into view as Prigozhin's close associate. The mercenary group has for years been active in a number of African countries, from Libya and Mali to Central African Republic.
But officially, Prigozhin had no special relationship with the president.
Mr Putin or his press secretary Dmitry Peskov would say merely that they were aware of the existence of a Russian ""private businessman"" who was involved in those activities. But it was clear such operations couldn't be conducted without Kremlin consent.
President Putin only admitted in June that Wagner had received enormous state funding for years and that its mercenaries had fought valiantly in battle. And yet because private military companies were illegal, he said that as a group, they did not exist.
It was not until the summer of 2022 that reports emerged of Wagner fighting in Ukraine.
Within weeks, Prigozhin was touring Russian prisons, recruiting inmates for the war effort.
The Kremlin spokesman spoke of him as a man ""whose heart aches for what's happening"" and one who was ""making a big contribution"".
Prigozhin opened a Wagner Centre in St Petersburg in November and his criticisms of the Russian army and the defence ministry became more vocal. 
As Russian forces were forced into a series of retreats in Ukraine, his criticism reached a peak.
He complained that the army command was refusing to recognise the mercenaries' contribution to the war effort. 
Later, he openly accused Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, of ""starving"" Wagner of ammunition while the group was losing thousands of men in the fight for Bakhmut in the east of Ukraine. 
At one point, Prigozhin even aimed his criticism at the president, referring to him with the Russian word for grandad. 
""How can we win a war when dedushka is a moron?""
He did not name Putin, but Russians were left in no doubt he was directly implicating him.
The Kremlin steered clear of commenting on the escalating feud, but it was a row that would shake Russia's leadership to its core and ultimately bring down Prigozhin.

He refused a defence ministry demand to bring all mercenary groups under its control. As the situation reached boiling point, he dared to question the very goals of the war.
On 23 June, he announced a ""march for justice"" on the road to Moscow.
Sources have told the BBC that his mutiny was a sign of Prigozhin's desperation and an attempt to attract President Putin's attention to his conflict with the Russian military.
""He was worried about losing his autonomy,"" one source who knew Prigozhin explained.
Wagner mercenaries shot down two military helicopters and a plane and killed up to 15 Russian soldiers.
Without naming him personally, President Putin described Prigozhin as a traitor who ""drove a knife in the back of the country"". 
This botched revolt was to be the final rupture between them.
Days after the rebellion had ended in failure, Vladimir Putin met his former ally at the Kremlin for three hours, along with more than 30 Wagner commanders.
Vladimir Putin had no more need of him, but there were still questions over the fate of his men.
Prigozhin clearly believed his future lay in Africa and his final online video was purportedly filmed in an African field where he claimed: ""Here we are, putting God's fear into Isis, al-Qaeda and other bandits."" 
But his story appears to have come to an end soon afterwards, following a trajectory similar to other examples in Russian history. A man handed the task of executing the Kremlin's cruellest policies was himself brutally punished and ultimately destroyed. 
Or in Vladimir Putin's own assessment: ""He was a man with a difficult fate and he made serious mistakes in life.""

Blackswan: The K-pop girl group with no Korean members,"Donning sari-inspired clothing and intricate jewellery, four young women are seen dancing energetically at a temple. Then, gulal, a colourful powder used in traditional rituals, is spread across the sky and onto their faces. 
This is not a Bollywood movie but the latest music video of K-pop girl group Blackswan.
Blackswan is currently the only K-pop girl group without any Korean members that has made its debut in South Korea. In 2017, an all-American K-pop boy band, Exp Edition, debuted in South Korea but they are no longer active.
It is not unusual for K-pop groups to have foreign members, typically from other Asian countries. One of K-pop's biggest girl group, Blackpink, has a member from Thailand. 
But apart from Blackswan member Sriya, who hails from India, none of the other band members are from Asia. Fatou grew up in Senegal and Belgium, Gabi is Brazilian-German and NVee comes from the US.
As the genre continues to globalise, the girl group has become part of a growing conversation about the definition of K-pop - and whether they fall within it. 
""They are affiliated with a Korean entertainment company, debuted in South Korea, and sing in Korean,"" said one commenter, suggesting they should be defined as K-pop. 
Other Koreans, however, are less positive. ""Without [them actually being] Korean, they are just a pop group.""
Blackswan are unfazed by such comments.
They say they identify as a K-pop group and sing in Korean.
It is an argument that will likely continue to divide Korea, as the government plans to launch a two-year ""K-culture training visa"", enabling foreigners to undergo K-pop training, 
Blackswan's atypical line-up was not by design initially and reflects the trajectory of the development of the genre.
The group's predecessor is Rania, which launched in 2011. It was made up of six Koreans and a Thai - though its membership experienced significant changes over the years.
In 2020, music company DR Music decided to rebrand Rania into Blackswan, with Fatou being the only one from its original line-up. 
""Some people might find it strange and even dislike the group for not having any Korean members,"" Philip YJ Yoon, managing director at DR Music, told the BBC. 
""However, we saw the opportunity in the expanding K-pop market.""
But this expansion isn't without its challenges. 
Language is the first barrier, as K-pop idols are expected to speak and perform in Korean. 
Korean has different speech forms, depending on the listeners' age, social status, level of intimacy and occasions. Honorifics are key to the language.
""You shouldn't use the name of a person or say 'you' in Korean. But in Portuguese and English, you always use it in a sentence. So, it was really hard for my brain to process,"" says Gabi. 
Some members still struggle with Korean.
But its dance practices they all find the hardest - with training typically taking up all day.
""When they constantly say, 'No, it's wrong. Do it again.' It was frustrating,"" says Nvee, who studied musical theatre and acting.
Gabi performed in a cover dance group back home in Brazil - so she thought dancing would come easy. 
""When I came here, oh my god, [I realised] I didn't know anything about dance,"" she says. 
Trainees also live together in a dorm and are restricted from going out and dating. They are also told to lose weight and need to look perfect. Any type of scandals are not permissible - as the Korean public hold celebrities to high moral standards.
Freelance casting director In Ji-woong, who has spent eight years as a choreographer for K-pop groups, says he has heard of foreign trainees escaping from their shared house to go clubbing. Their managers were ""urgently deployed"" to bring them back.    
Mr Yoon admits it is a challenge to work with international trainees: ""They often question the rules and are very straightforward.""
The rigidity of training and the hyper-competitiveness have also led to a mental health crisis in the K-pop industry. 
In April, fans were shocked by the sudden death of Moonbin, a member of boy band Astro. He was found unresponsive in his flat in the Gangnam neighbourhood of Seoul. In 2019, K-pop stars Sulli and her close friend Goo Hara passed away in a month - both suspected suicides.
""Dealing with mental stress was the most challenging part for me,"" says Fatou, who has suffered from depression symptoms since a young age. 
She says there are times when she asks herself: ""I can't dance, I can't rap, I can't sing. What [am I] doing?""
Fatou is seeing a psychiatrist and has been on medication since February. This is the first time she's ever sought medical help for her symptoms, and her agency is paying for it. Still, she says K-pop is what brings her the most joy.  
An increasing number of entertainment companies now offer trainees and idols more personal time. Some of the rules are made more lenient, too.
As for Blackswan, its members are confident that they represent the future of K-pop.
""K-pop will become more globalised, so that there are more global groups being trained and making debut in the global market,"" Gabi says.
Sriya has put it in simpler terms: ""Everybody can do it… because skin colours don't define anything.""

Ukraine war: Fighter ace and two other pilots killed in mid-air crash,"This video can not be played
Watch: Ukrainian fighter pilot 'Juice' talks about his job hunting Russian cruise missiles
One of Ukraine's most celebrated fighter pilots and two other airmen have been killed in a mid-air crash. 
Andrii Pilshchykov won fame taking part in dogfights over Kyiv during the early phase of Russia's invasion.
The Ukrainian military called the airmen's deaths ""painful and irreparable"" losses, and paid tribute to Pilshchykov as a pilot with ""mega knowledge and mega talent"".
The crash involved two L-39 training planes flying over northern Ukraine.
An investigation is under way into whether flight preparation rules were not correctly followed, resulting in Friday's crash in Zhytomyr Oblast. The region is west of the capital, Kyiv, and hundreds of miles from the frontline.
President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed the deaths in his nightly video address, saying that his country would ""never forget anyone who defended the free skies of Ukraine"".
Last autumn, as Russia launched hundreds of cruise missiles and drones at Ukraine, Pilshchykov - who flew under the call-sign ""Juice"" - spoke to the BBC about the pressure he felt as a MiG-29 fighter pilot tasked with trying to intercept the deadly weapons before they struck.
""Intercepting the cruise missiles, your mission is to save the lives on the ground, to save the city. If you are not able, it's a terrible feeling that somebody will die. Somebody will die in minutes and you didn't prevent that,"" he said.
He also spoke of his lifelong ""dream"" to join the Ukrainian air force which he saw as his ""mission"".
Melaniya Podolyak, a friend of Pilshchykov, also confirmed his death, posting an image of his air force badge on social media. 
The crash and deaths are a major upset for Ukraine as it prepares to receive up to 61 F-16 fighter jets from its allies, in a bid to step up its counteroffensive.
On Thursday, the Pentagon confirmed that English-language training for Ukrainians on operating F-16s would begin in Texas in September, with flight training expected to begin in October in Arizona. Meanwhile, other Western allies are preparing to start training Ukrainians later this month.
The training to fly F-16s is expected to take around five months.
The American decision earlier this year to supply F-16 jets represented an about-turn. This is because the US and its Nato allies - who had earlier ruled out the move - had feared this would lead to further escalation with nuclear-armed Russia.
A spokesman for Ukraine's Air Force, Yurii Ihnat, paid tribute to Pilshchykov in a statement posted on his Facebook page.
""A year ago in the USA, Andrii met with American government officials, brought up the urgent needs of the Air Force, was in constant contact with Californian pilots, and was the main driver of an advocacy group promoting many decisions on the F-16s [supply],"" Ihnat said. 
""During the war, he gave dozens of interviews to Western media because he knew English well, and the most important was the topic of conversation: what can and should be talked about for Ukraine! 
""You can't even imagine how he wanted to fly on an F-16... but now that American planes are actually on the horizon, he will not fly them.
""Andrii Pilshchykov was not just a pilot, he was a young officer with great knowledge and great talent. 
""He was an excellent communicator, the driver of reforms in Air Force aircraft, a participant in many projects. I often supported his crazy ideas, which gave incredible results!""

At a glance
Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said the ""whole nation mourns"" the deaths of four young people in County Tipperary
Luke McSweeney, 24, and his sister Grace, 18, were among those killed when the car they were travelling in hit a wall in Clonmel
Nicole Murphy and Zoey Coffey, both 18, also died in the crash
It is believed they were on their way to an exam results celebration
A number of events due to take place in the town on Saturday have been cancelled
A vigil is to be held on Sunday in memory of four young people who died in a car crash in County Tipperary.
Brother and sister Luke McSweeney, 24, and Grace McSweeney, 18, died in the crash along with 18-year-olds Nicole Murphy and Zoey Coffey.
The car they were travelling in crashed into a wall in Clonmel on Friday evening.
The whole of Ireland is mourning after their deaths, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said.
Irish broadcaster RTÉ understands they were on their way to meet friends to celebrate receiving Leaving Cert exam results.
The principal of Presentation Secondary School, where Zoey and Grace had attended, said the town is ""covered in a cloud of sadness and devastation"" by the deaths of ""two beautiful students"".
Michael O'Loughlin added: ""Our school community is in mourning today.""
Anne McGrath, principal of Loreto Secondary School where Nicole Murphy had attended, said Friday's celebrations are now replaced by ""unbearable grief and a sense of loss for the whole local community"".
Mr Varadkar said results night should mark the ""beginning of a world of opportunities for young people"".
""It’s a milestone on the road from childhood to adulthood,"" he said.
""For young lives, so full of possibility, to be cut short in this way is truly devastating and heartbreaking. The whole nation mourns them.""
Mr Varadkar offered his condolences to the families and friends of those killed, as well as the wider community of Clonmel.
""The thoughts of the whole country are with them, their school and their community.""
President Michael D Higgins said the ""hearts of all parents and relatives, indeed the whole community"" will have gone out to the victims' families.
He added that ""the grief that has been expressed by the community is nearly unbearable"". 
Speaking to the media on Saturday afternoon, Supt Kieran Ruane said the local community was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the tragic events.
He has been in touch with the principals of the schools the girls attended, and said support is being put in place for friends of the victims in the next few days.
He paid tribute to the emergency services who attended the scene on Friday.
""The scene was very difficult, in very adverse weather conditions and the professionalism shown by all first responders and the care and respect shown to the four deceased was exemplary,"" he said.
Supt Ruane said family liaison officers have been appointed, and the families have appealed for privacy at this time.
He asked those with footage or images of the Mountain Road where the crash took place between 19:00 and 19:30 to contact gardaí.
The vigil will take place at 18:30 local time in the Denis Burke Park in Clonmel on Sunday.
Post-mortem examinations are due to take place over the coming days in Waterford University Hospital.
Local priest Fr Michael Toomey said ""no words are adequate"" to describe the tragedy.
He urged those in the town to look after each other for what will be ""difficult days ahead"".
""No words can give comfort at this time. My thoughts and prayers are with the families tonight who suffered a terrible loss in this terrible accident,"" he said.
He also repeated a gardaí's (Irish police) request for people not to share images on social media as to not cause further distress to heartbroken families.
""My thoughts and prayers are with the four young people who tragically lost their lives tonight, to their families, and their friends, on what should have been one of the happiest nights of their lives,"" he added.
A number of events due to take place in the town, including local park runs and Pride parade events, have been cancelled.

Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill said ""our hearts are sore"" after the deaths of the four young people.
""Their families, friends, and the local community are all in the thoughts and prayers of everyone across the island,"" she posted on social media.
""The country mourns with you during this very sad time.""

""How quickly joy can turn to tragedy as we are all reminded of the uncertainty of life.""

The Rubiales World Cup kiss row so far,"This video can not be played
It was the kiss seen around the world. 
As Spain's victorious World Cup winning women's football team went on stage to receive their medals, the head of Spanish Football kissed midfielder Jenni Hermoso on the lips. 
An image of the moment quickly circulated online and since then Luis Rubiales has faced a storm of criticism. 
The player has called the kiss non-consensual while Mr Rubiales, after initially apologising, said he would not give into calls to resign from his position. 
Here's the story so far.

Luis Rubiales kissing Jenni Hermoso unleashes social tsunami in Spain,"This video can not be played
Watch: The Rubiales World Cup kiss row... in 75 seconds
A kiss on the lips, a growing backlash and mass resignations among coaching staff: BBC Sport's Spanish football expert Guillem Balague reflects on a tumultuous week for the sport and for Spain's society as a whole.
This is the Spanish MeToo moment.
It's an opportunity to focus everybody's attention on the treatment of women in football - and on the frustration at what many see as systemic blindness at the top of an elite organisation, the Spanish football federation.
Jenni Hermoso is being backed not just by female players, but male players too - although perhaps not as much as hoped.
It's caused a storm in football, which has turned into a social tsunami. It feels like wherever you are, everyone is talking about it, and in Spain it's the number one story every day.
It's a story about a man - Luis Rubiales - who appears completely out of touch with reality, a man long followed by acolytes and surrounded by supporters with an apparently identical world view.
But now, this influential group has become a minority.
Their defiance on this issue has left many people incredulous - and in Spain, they are looking exposed.
The coaching staff of the women's national side has resigned, but notably not the manager Jorge Vilda, who was - alongside other senior figures in Spanish football - spotted clapping when Rubiales was talking yesterday.
This has not gone unnoticed by the Spanish public.
Remember that the players were not just asking for Rubiales to go, but for other members of the federation to go too. These women who have conquered the world see this moment as an opportunity to move aside anyone they think is standing in the way of their mission to achieve unflinching respect and equality.
For many people, this is about how discrimination against women functions. It not just done by one person; it is done by a system.
And in Spain, this episode shows how the battle lines have been drawn.
It's a battle being taken up at the very highest level.
Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has no fear proclaiming himself a feminist. In the Spanish sporting groups I circulate in, people feel they must intervene - that action must be taken.
And beyond that, the feeling is Spain must take advantage of this moment, which has intensified so quickly and is capturing headlines around the world.
One week ago, we were celebrating a historic World Cup victory. That has quickly soured, some say. It's been a whirlwind of success and recrimination, of holding to account - and of sheer defiance.
But there is one thing people on every side agree on: this is one of the most important weeks for Spain in living memory.
For many people, it's an opportunity to move into a better place. For others it's a chance to set the record straight - as they see it.
It's difficult to exaggerate how influential Rubiales was. His defiance suggests he may have felt safety in that influence.
But the voices against him have multiplied, starting with Jenni Hermoso and her fellow players and then snowballing into their coaching staff, the men's game and the newspapers. Now, this is being talked about around almost every single dinner table in Spain.
He may not feel so safe any more.

Gabon election: President Ali Bongo aims for third term,"Voting has taken place in the oil-rich central African nation of Gabon where President Ali Bongo - who came to power when his father Omar died in 2009 - is hoping to win a third term.
He faces competition from 13 people.
As polls closed, the government announced a curfew and suspension of internet access for security reasons.
On Saturday main opposition candidate Albert Ondo Ossa had complained that many polling stations lacked ballot papers bearing his name.
""Gabon is not the property of the Bongos,"" he said on the campaign trail.
Mr Ondo Ossa, a former economics professor and one-time education minister, was appointed as leader of the Alternance 2023 coalition just last week.
The coalition says the names of some of those who have withdrawn from the presidential race are still on the ballot sheet.
As in previous general elections, there are serious concerns about the process.
Both of Mr Bongo's prior wins were disputed as fraudulent by opponents, and this time around controversial changes were made to voting papers just weeks before election day.
For the first time, voters were asked to mark a single ballot with their choice of a president and MP who must belong to the same party.
Experts say this disadvantages independent candidates - notably Mr Ondo Ossa, who heads the main opposition coalition but lacks a party of his own.
Foreign media have been banned from setting foot in the country to cover Saturday's vote, says the campaign group Reporters Without Borders.
No international election monitors from the EU or UN were present either. 
Local civil society group Tournons La Page said they would try to act as observers despite having no official accreditation.
There were reports of delays at some voting centres, and as voting closed the government announced a curfew starting on Sunday evening and said internet access had been suspended throughout the country.
Communications Minister Rodrigue Mboumba Bissawou said the measures were aimed at countering ""calls for violence... and false information"".
Before Saturday's vote a row erupted, with President Bongo accusing Mr Ondo Ossa and another opposition figure of treason.
The pair deny claims that they were recorded plotting ways to create a power struggle in Gabon and win support from foreign powers, and they have accused the government of ""shameful manipulation"" in a statement released by Alternance 2023.
As well as voting for their choice of president and MPs, the people of Gabon were also choosing mayors and local councillors.
Gabon has a total population of 2.3 million people and enjoys oil wealth and rich swathes of rainforest. 
But the global economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has led to declining exports of raw materials.
Back in 2018, President Bongo suffered a stroke which sidelined him for almost a year and lead to calls for him to step aside.
The following year, a failed coup attempt saw mutinying soldiers sent to prison.

Poland investigates cyber-attack on rail network,"Polish intelligence services are investigating a hacking attack on the country's railways, Polish media say.
Hackers broke into railway frequencies to disrupt traffic in the north-west of the country overnight, the Polish Press Agency (PAP) reported on Saturday.
The signals were interspersed with recording of Russia's national anthem and a speech by President Vladimir Putin, the report says.
Poland is a major transit hub for Western weapons being sent to Ukraine.
Saturday's incident occurred when hackers transmitted a signal that triggered an emergency stoppage of trains near the city of Szczecin, PAP reported.
About 20 trains were brought to a standstill, but services were restored within hours.
Stanislaw Zaryn, a senior security official, said Poland's internal security service ABW was investigating. ""For the moment, we are ruling nothing out,"" he told PAP.
""We know that for some months there have been attempts to destabilise the Polish state,"" Mr Zaryn added. ""Such attempts have been undertaken by the Russian Federation in conjunction with Belarus."" 
A number of Western countries have called for increased cyber-security precautions as the Ukraine conflict unfolds.
Some experts have said Russia is carrying out cyberattacks in Ukraine in an apparent attempt to test its hacking tools.
Russia has previously called such allegations ""Russophobic"".

India teacher investigated for telling pupils to slap Muslim peer,"Police in India are investigating a video that shows a school teacher telling her pupils to slap their seven-year-old Muslim classmate.
The boy is filmed in tears as he is slapped, allegedly for getting his times tables wrong. 
The video went viral on social media, and has triggered widespread dismay and condemnation.
India's opposition leader Rahul Gandhi blamed the government for stoking religious intolerance.
The incident happened on Thursday at a private school in Uttar Pradesh, a northern state.
""Why are you hitting him so lightly? Hit him hard,"" the teacher is heard telling the children, as the boy stands crying.
""Start hitting him on the waist... His face is turning red, hit him on the waist instead,"" she added.
Authorities in India confirmed the video was real, and said they would take action. 
The victim's father reported the incident to police in the Muzaffarnagar district, and has pulled him out of the school. But he did not press charges.
Rights groups have warned that hate crimes and violence against India's large Muslim minority have increased since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office in 2014.
Uttar Pradesh has been governed by his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since 2017. 
Mr Gandhi said the party had contributed to religious tensions felt across India.
""Sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children, turning a holy place like school into a marketplace of hatred,"" he posted to social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. 
""This is the same kerosene spread by the BJP that has set every corner of India on fire.""
In June during a visit to the US Mr Modi told journalists that there was ""absolutely no space for discrimination"" in India.

India train fire: Gas canister sets off deadly explosion,"A fire on a train carriage has killed nine people in India, after a gas canister used by passengers to make drinks exploded, officials say.
Nine others were injured in the fire, which occurred in the southern city of Madurai in Tamil Nadu state.
The carriage was carrying more than 50 pilgrims from Uttar Pradesh and was parked at the station when the cylinder blew up early on Saturday.
Survivors had to break doors to flee the burning carriage, eyewitnesses say.
The coach involved in Saturday's incident had arrived from Uttar Pradesh earlier in the day.
It was due to remain parked at Madurai station for two days, local media say.
The gas cylinder was illegally taken inside the carriage, officials are quoted as saying.
India suffered one of its worst-ever rail disasters in June when a collision killed 275 people in Odisha state.

Kenya power cuts: Airports boss sacked as tourists left stranded,"The head of Kenya's airports authority has been sacked after a power cut left passengers stranded in darkness for hours at Nairobi's main airport. 
Alex Gitari was fired by Transport Minister Kipchumba Murkomen, who has apologised for the chaos.
He added that political interference had resulted in a demoralised and disorganised workforce.
The majority state-owned power company has not explained exactly what caused the countrywide power cut.
Although some areas have seen power restored, homes and businesses across much of the country are still affected by the outage that began on Friday.
Tourism is a key part of Kenya's economy, accounting for about 10% of GDP at the last count by government. The sector is also one of the East African nation's top sources of hard currency.
Kenyans on social media are outraged that the main airport did not have functioning back-up generators.
In addition to Mr Gitari, another senior civil aviation authority official has been sacked and the manager of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport has been demoted to a role at Mombasa's main airport.
Meanwhile, there have been chaotic scenes and long queues at the entrances to Kenya's national parks after the digital payment system failed.
Power cuts are not unusual in Kenya, but such a lengthy countrywide outage with Nairobi's main airport, hospitals and even State House plunged into darkness is rare.
When things don't run smoothly, Kenyans are quick to point to corruption - the colossal theft of public funds has long held the country back.
The transport minister said two generators procured for the airport two years ago are yet to be commissioned.
It would be interesting to know how much they cost, who got the contract and why they have not yet been installed.

High-altitude heist shocks Switzerland,"Thieves in Switzerland have conquered one of the country's most challenging protected climbing routes.
They ascended to an altitude of 2,350m and traversed gorges on narrow steel cables - all to rob a collection box. 
The box belongs to a local climbing club, which maintains Switzerland's longest protected climbing route on the Gemmi pass above Leukerbad village.
What has caused the biggest shock is that the donation box is accessible only to the most experienced climbers. 
The route, known as a via ferrata, is classed as level 5, the most difficult, and involves serious climbing as well as ascending ladders bolted into the vertical rock face, and traversing gorges on narrow steel cables.
""What kind of people are these?"" wrote the climbing club on its Facebook page.
""The climbing club looks after the via ferrata for no salary, we don't ask for anything, and now someone has stolen the money donated to maintain it.""
Those who discovered the theft believe it was carefully planned well in advance. 
The donation box was found smashed open and empty. The thieves were not only good climbers, equipped with all the necessary mountaineering kit, they took the tools with them to break open the donation box ""with brute force"" the climbing club said.
Astonishingly, it appears they then continued their ascent, with the money, to the top of the Dauberhorn, at 2941 metres. 
Trying to find out exactly who committed the crime may be difficult though - the last few days have been perfect climbing weather, and there were many mountaineers enjoying the via ferrata.
The climbing club is not sure exactly how much money was stolen; but club member and mountain guide Richard Werlen told the BBC it was likely to be at least 400-500 Swiss francs (£359-449; €420-520; $450-560). 
Switzerland is still a country where cash is used on a regular basis, and the Swiss are proud of their voluntary work maintaining hiking paths and climbing routes. A donation for such effort is expected, and gladly given, by large parts of the population.
But now organisations like the climbing club may wonder if they need to change the way they seek donations. 
The pervasiveness of cash in Switzerland has already led to a spate of robberies of far better protected ATM machines. 
Millions of francs have been stolen in the last three years alone, causing the Swiss Federal Police to warn that the regularly filled and often poorly monitored machines are becoming a magnet for thieves from across Europe.
For the moment, the climbing club is hoping that whoever stole the money will suffer from ""a guilty conscience"", and quietly return it. 
And Richard Werlen has some consolation to report. This morning, a local benefactor sent in 500 francs to replace the stolen donations.

Wagner mercenaries must swear allegiance to Russia - Putin,"President Vladimir Putin has called on all employees of Wagner and other Russian private military contractors to take an oath of allegiance to the Russian state.
The decree applies to anyone participating in military activities in Ukraine, assisting the army and serving in territorial defence units.
He signed the decree on Friday, with immediate effect.
It comes two days after Wagner leaders were presumed killed in a plane crash.
In a separate development on Saturday, a far-right subunit of Wagner, known as Rusich, said it was stopping military operations in Ukraine.
In a Telegram post, Rusich accused Russia's foreign ministry of failing to protect a founding member of the group, Yan Petrovsky, who has been arrested in Finland for visa violations and is facing extradition to Ukraine.
Analysts suggest Mr Putin's decree is part of attempts to reassert his authority following Wagner's mutiny in June.
""Putin wants to have tighter control on Wagner to make sure he won't be facing another crisis in the future,"" Natia Seskuria of Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank, told the BBC.
The decree comes as Wagner mercenaries are lacking an obvious leader, after a plane presumed to be carrying Yevgeny Prigozhin and other leaders crashed on Wednesday, killing all 10 people on board.
Described in the decree as a step to build the spiritual and moral foundations of Russia's defence, the oath includes a promise to strictly follow the orders of commanders.
""It is a concealed message to military intelligence to find and prosecute Wagner fighters,"" Petro Burkovskyi, who heads the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a think tank based in Ukraine, told the BBC. 
And it is a clear message to the fighters, too, he suggests: ""Either take the oath and keep your arms or disarm yourself. You obey or you go to prison.""
A few weeks before Prigozhin's failed uprising in June, the Russian defence ministry gave mercenary groups until 1 July to sign army contracts.
Prigozhin refused to sign, because he did not want Wagner to operate under the ministry. Mr Putin backed the ministry's contract scheme, which was the first public blow against his long-term ally Prigozhin.
The row escalated, leading to Prigozhin's mutiny.
But what effect will the decree have on the Wagner fighters without an obvious leader?
Mr Burkovskyi thinks that as experienced servicemen, they are good assets for the Russian army.
""They chose Wagner because Wagner gave them special treatment, without the bureaucracy of the huge Russian army. If they get special treatment under Putin's orders, I don't think they care about where, to whom and for whom they will fight.""
Ms Seskuria believes that although the decree may have an effect in the short term, there are loyal Prigozhin supporters who will not take the oath.
""This can potentially create problems for Putin in a longer term-perspective,"" he says.
Meanwhile Russian air defences prevented drone attacks on Moscow and Belgorod regions on Saturday morning, officials said.
In the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, four people were wounded by shelling, the local governor said.
The Ukrainian government almost never publicly admits carrying out attacks inside Russia.
And in Ukraine, two people were killed and one wounded as Russia shelled a Ukrainian village near the north-eastern town of Kupiansk, Kharkiv's regional governor said.

Maui wildfires: 100 people reported safe after officials release list of missing,"This video can not be played
Watch: Maui divers search water for human remains
Within hours of releasing the names of 388 people unaccounted for following the Maui wildfires, 100 were reported safe, the FBI confirmed.
Authorities released the names on Thursday and asked survivors to come forward, so they could focus their efforts on locating any others.
The official death toll from the fires currently stands at 115.
Search teams are still combing through the charred remains of the historic town of Lahaina and other areas.
The devastating fires spread on 8 August and blazed through the oceanside town of Lahaina, home to 12,000 people.
In a press conference, the FBI's special agent in charge in Honolulu, Steven Merril, said they were ""very thankful for the people who have reached out by phone or email"". 
""As we get someone off of a list, this has enabled us to devote more resources to those who are still on the list.""
In a statement on Thursday, Maui's police chief John Pellettier said the names were released in an effort to narrow down who remains unaccounted for.
""We know that it will help with the investigation,"" Chief Pelletier said. 
Officials also asked residents to come forward if they see a name of a person they know to be safe. 
Earlier in the week, authorities said more than 1,000 people were still unaccounted for. 
As of Thursday, Chief Pelletier said that an additional 1,732 people who were believed to be missing have since been found safe. Officials have been able to narrow down the list of missing by cross referencing it with names of people staying at shelters. 
""We also know that once those names come out, it can and will cause pain for folks whose loved ones are listed,"" Chief Pelletier added in his statement. 
""This is not an easy thing to do, but we want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to make this investigation as complete and thorough as possible.""
The wildfires are among the deadliest in US history, and officials have said that they anticipate the death toll may rise. 
Maui officials have publicly identified 46 people who died in the fire. The latest names, released on Thursday, include a family of four whose remains were found in a burnt car near their home. 
They were identified as: 7-year-old Tony Takafua; his mother Salote Tone, 39; and his grandparents Faaoso Tone, 70, and Maluifonua Tone, 73.
Tony is the first confirmed child victim of the wildfire.

Niger journalist: I lie awake at night fearing they will arrest me,"My country Niger is never normally ""front page news"" but that all changed on 26 July.
Rumours started to circulate that there had been a coup at the presidential palace. I immediately got to work, tapping up contacts, trying to establish the facts.
I didn't have to wait long - that same night the head of the presidential guard announced that President Mohamed Bazoum was under ""house arrest"". The democratically elected president had been overthrown. Two days later, Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani proclaimed himself the new leader.
For the next two weeks, I barely slept. Everyone across the BBC wanted to talk to me but communication was difficult.
Before long, the atmosphere began to change on the street. ""You're either with us or against us"" was the line from the military junta and their supporters.
As the BBC reported all the twists and turns, including the reaction of the regional Ecowas bloc as well as Western countries, the mood soured. I was doing my job, striving to report fairly and objectively on developments.
But some of our audience in Niger were only interested in hearing information which chimed with their viewpoint. Pro-Russia, pro-Tchiani, anti-French - these labels hide more than they explain but I was suddenly in the spotlight.
I started being trolled heavily on social media and then came abusive phone calls. The military junta threatened to throw out all ""foreign"" media. It was too risky for me to go down the street in the capital Niamey and report on any of the pro-Tchiani demonstrations.
As doing my job has become more difficult, so has life in general. I now spend most of my day without electricity as Nigeria has cut its supply. It's a daily battle to charge my laptop and mobile phone which more often than not fails. I know these sound like ""first world problems"" but if I can't do my job, how will people know what is happening? 
Food is also becoming more difficult to find due to the Ecowas economic blockade. People are hurting and it's understandable they are looking for someone to blame. We're also running out of money - vital in this cash economy where everyone lives day to day. The limit for a withdrawal is now 50,000 CFA (about $83; £64). It may seem a large sum but prices have rocketed.
When I do my shopping, I keep a low profile. The joy and laughter I used to see and hear on the streets has disappeared. Everyone talks about the coup but only one side is allowed to ""lead"" the debate.
Anyone who openly opposes the coup risks being beaten up or having their house ransacked. I fear I could be arrested at any moment by the military junta. This thought keeps me awake at night but I have taken some precautions.
I lock the door behind me when I'm home and won't open it to anyone. It's a shadow of the life I used to lead but I want to keep telling the story of my country to the world.

Coaches from Spain women's team quit over Rubiales kiss,"

All times stated are UK
After a particularly busy day, we're going to pause our coverage of the Hermoso kiss row.
It was a busy day, with major developments including that Luis Rubiales was suspended by Fifa pending the outcome of its disciplinary proceedings. Spain's entire coaching staff from their World Cup win - except for the manager - also resigned over the controversy.
If you want to read more about what happened, head to our story here.
Today's page was brought to you by Jamie Whitehead, Ali Abbas Ahmadi, Antoinette Radford and Nathan Williams.
We've put together this video summing up the whole controversy, in one minute and 15 seconds.
Spain's football federation, the RFEF, has now deleted a statement from
its official website accusing the World Cup winning player, Jenni Hermoso, of
misrepresenting reality.
Earlier today, the federation threatened Hermoso with legal action after
she accused the head of the federation, Luis Rubiales, of kissing her on the
lips without consent.
Rubiales has faced
a wave of condemnation but insisted the kiss was consensual and has refused to
resign.
US women's football team San Diego Wave FC has expressed its support for Jenni Hermoso. 
The team, managed by ex-Manchester United manager Casey Stoney, posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) showing their players wearing tape on their wrists in support of the Spanish star during their victory of Orlando Pride yesterday. 
'We're with you Jenni Hermoso,' the club tweeted in Spanish ahead of the game. 
The player at the centre of all of this is Jenni Hermoso - a highly decorated footballer who is considered one of Spain's best ever female footballers. Here is a quick look at her career:
Last Sunday, Spanish fans were revelling in the success of their national women's team. Today, the headlines couldn't be more different. 
Here's a brief timeline of how we got here...

A senior official at the Spanish women's football league has condemned the actions of Luis Rubiales
Pedro Malabia Sanchis, chief strategy officer at the Spanish Women's Football League - or Liga F - has been speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM on Saturday. 
Sanchis says on the programme: ""We don't want these kind of people in football, in society. It's a reflection of what Spain is, what the world is.
""It's about honour, honourability, it's about respect. If you are supporting this kind of behaviour you are part of the problem, and you need to go out of football. 
""[Rubiales] has stolen the biggest sports moment in Spain for many years."" 
Sanchis also praises the players who said they would refuse to play for Spain while Rubiales remains in his role.
Here's a quick summary of what's happened so far today, 
Rubiales maintains that he will defend himself, and says he ""fully trusts Fifa"". He says the kiss was consensual. Rubiales does not.
Six teams are playing in Spain’s top flight men’s league - and two games have already started.
So far, only one La Liga player has said he won’t play for the national team
while Rubiales is in charge of Spain's football federation – that's Real Betis
striker Borja Iglesias.
We’re keeping an eye on the fixtures today, and will bring you any
updates from clubs, players and supporters' groups as we get it.
Today's La Liga fixtures: 
Champions Barcelona are away at Sevilla tomorrow.
Before Rubiales was
suspended by FIFA, Hermoso's former club Barcelona released a statement supporting her after the kiss following
last weekend’s World Cup final. 
The club “wishes to
make clear that it considers totally improper and inappropriate the RFEF
president's behaviour”, it said in a statement, and labelled Rubiales’ actions
as “deplorable”.
The statement went
on to say that the club is committed to maintaining “equality between men and
women in sport and in society in general” and in guaranteeing the safety of
women.
Hermoso played for Barcelona for four
years between 2013 and 2017.

For me, this is the
Spanish #MeToo. It certainly feels like a tsunami - a social, political and
sporting tsunami.
And it's a great
opportunity to focus attention on the treatment of woman, and on the systemic
corruption of an elite organisation, like the Spanish football federation.
It's the story not
just about a guy who's completely out of touch with reality, but who has
created his own world in his little castle, surrounded by acolytes and people
that see the world the same as him. 
But they have
become a minority, and their way of looking at the world has been exposed. 
These include the
manager of the women's national side - the controversial Jorge Vilda - or the
manager of the men's national team Luis de la Fuente (who on Saturday issued a statement condemning Rubiales' behaviour). They were among those
seen clapping in the assembly yesterday when Luis Rubiales was defending his
actions in front of members of the Spanish federation.
And so it's worth
remembering that the players are not calling just for Rubiales to go, but for
all the directors' heads as well. The system has to change
The manager of Spain’s men’s national team, Luis de la Fuente, has now issued a statement
criticising the “wrong and misplaced behaviour of the president of the RFEF”, according
to Spanish sports newspaper AS.
On Friday De la Fuente was seen applauding Rubiales’ statement to the Spanish federation during which he defended his actions and vowed not to resign.
But De la Fuente has now said
Rubiales’ actions “are not edifying or appropriate for a person who was
representing all of Spanish football”.
He also expressed his “absolute
rejection of any act of sexist violence. There is no room for lukewarm postures
when facing this type of situation.”
He said he regrets
that this has “taken centre stage to what is really important: the
unprecedented feat achieved by Spanish women's football, of which we should all
feel very proud"".
Several female
members of the women’s football coaching staff were forced to sit in the front
row during Luis Rubiales’ address to the Spanish football federation yesterday
in an attempt to show that they supported his message, according to the statement released by
the staff shared by presenter Semra Hunter.
Rubiales defended kissing
Jenni Hermoso and vowed not to resign in front of the Spanish football
federation on Friday.
This was seen as particularly
hurtful, and is one of the reasons listed for their resignation.
The statement from
the 11 members of the coaching staff says Rubiales ""offered a story that
does not reflect in any way what was felt by Jenni Hermoso, who has expressly
stated that she felt she was the ""victim of aggression"", and that
they are resigning from their positions.
""Given the
unacceptable attitudes and statements made by the president, they have made the
decision to relieve themselves of their duties,"" it reads as
translated by sports presenter Semra Hunter.
The resignations would leave the
manager Jorge Vilda on his own. 
Vilda supports Rubiales and has his
own issues with the players.
We're hearing reports that a large number of coaches from the Spanish women's national team have resigned in protest over the conduct of Luis Rubiales, who kissed star player Jenni Hermoso on the lips after the team won the World Cup.
More on this shortly...
Guillem Balague
Spanish football expert
This story has
snowballed especially quickly because it comes off the back of Spain's victory
in the Women's World Cup.
Many people are
saying that it’s a shame not to be celebrating the football success.
But I see this as
one of the biggest weeks I can remember in the recent history of Spain - in a
positive way - because of the way this issue has shaken up Spanish football,
and Spanish society.
It's an opportunity
even for the journalists writing about the story to make changes - to bring
more women, and more people from the minorities onto news desks, to understand
how the world really runs and how to make it better.
So it's a chance, a big chance, to
move things forward.
Luis Rubiales will
fight the accusations against him, a statement from the Spanish football
federation says. 
The full statement
reads:
""Luis Rubiales has stated that
he will legally defend himself in the competent bodies, he fully trusts Fifa
and reiterates that, in this way, he is given the opportunity to begin his defence
so that the truth prevails and his complete innocence is proven.""
We're seeing reports from the Reuters news agency that Luis Rubiales says he will defend himself after Fifa suspended him from ""all football-related activities at national and international level"" for an initial 90-day period. 
We'll bring you more shortly...
Guy Hedgecoe
Reporting from Madrid
One
of the sub-plots to the Rubiales affair has been how it affects Spain's international
image. 
A specific concern is the country's candidacy to host the men's 2030 Fifa World
Cup, in a shared bid with Portugal, Morocco and Ukraine.
Culture and
Sports Minister Miquel Iceta told El País (in an interview published this morning) that he was hopeful the bid would not be undermined and added: ""If we
are able to respond quickly we can come out of this stronger.""
Fifa's
suspension of Rubiales, however, only increases the international dimension of this
crisis. 
The racism row that engulfed Spanish football earlier this year, following abuse
of the Real Madrid player Vinicius Jr, raised similar worries.
Bruno Boelpaep
Reporting from Madrid
At a Saturday morning training session at Las Rozas Football
Club, the local team is playing a friendly game against neighbouring town of Guadia.
Nines and Javier live in Las Rozas, in the outskirts of the
Spanish capital Madrid.
They are watching their son David, 18, play his first game
of the new season.
When asked about Rubiales, Nines doesn’t hesitate: “He humiliated a woman and he needs to go. He doesn’t
represent us. He doesn’t represent men’s football or women’s football”, she says.

Alex Webster is a local player, he comes out of the changing
room after finishing his training session and says: “I
Think Spanish society is really on the girl‘s side, from what I’ve seen, what
people have been posting, players, managers, people are on the girl's side. Not
many people are with the president”
 
The controversy concerning the head of Spanish football and a kiss at the Women's World Cup final explained.

Zanzibar boxing: Sixty-year ban to end with first bout,"Boxing fans in Zanzibar are set to enjoy the first fight in almost six decades on Sunday after a long-standing ban was lifted.
The 1960s ban followed the revolution by the island's first President Abedi Amani Karume, citing cultural reasons. 
The event aligns with current President Hussein Mwinyi's strategic push to promote tourism and sports development. 
Zanzibar's Hamis Muay Thai will face Ibrahim Mjender in the historic eight-round non-title lightweight fight.
Hamis Muay Thai, who began his fighting career with a lot of success as a kickboxer, will be making his debut in the ring as a boxer.
Another local boy Musa Nassor ""Banja"" is also on the bill. He will trade fists with Dullah Mbabe from the mainland, while Karim Mandonga, a charismatic Tanzanian boxer will square up with Osman Muller Junior from Zanzibar in another bout.
There will be a total of eight boxing matches in all.
As the revolution of January 1964 ended the rule of the Sultan of Zanzibar and his majority Arab government, people close to then President Karume say he viewed boxing as ""inhumane"" arguing that fighting was for animals.
The ban, however, did not affect Tanzania's mainland. 
Tanganyika and Zanzibar were united in April 1964 to form what is now the United Republic of Tanzania.
Results of six-month research conducted in 2021 suggested that just over 60% of the population in Zanzibar were in favour of the return of boxing. 
Zanzibar is trying to open its doors to the world to attract more foreign investors and tourists. Current President Mwinyi's Blue Economy policy includes an emphasis on tourism and sport.
Recently, British female boxer Natasha Jones was named honorary ambassador for Zanzibar in sport tourism.
""It's a great honour and I will do the best that I can for the people of Zanzibar to represent them in a good way but also promote everything that they have already,"" said Jones, the champion boxer.
All the boxers have been paid their participation fee, although there will not be any prize money.
The milestone event will take place at the Mao Tse Tung Stadium on Sunday and will be broadcast live on TV.
Halka Ahmed a young content creator said he is very excited.
""This will work well with my fellow young people who really want to become professional boxers in Zanzibar"". 
Many other locals are also looking forward to the revival of boxing in Zanzibar.
""This is an historic move,"" said Sandaland Omari, a sports-shop owner.

Alexander Kielland relatives seek answers 43 years on,"Descendants of a British oil rig worker killed when the accommodation platform he was on capsized hope to get answers and closure when they travel to Norway.
The body of Keith Hunter, 34, was never found after he and 122 others were killed when the Alexander Kielland platform overturned in 1980.
He was one of six men from Cumbria killed in the disaster in the Ekofisk oil field in the Norwegian North Sea.
A conference is being held in Stavanger for families seeking answers.
An official inquiry held behind closed doors said the 27 March disaster, which had 89 survivors, was caused by a fatigue crack on a bracing holding one of the five legs supporting the so-called flotel.
But families said they had never been able to see the report and had many questions about what actually happened.
Campaigner Kian Reme of the Kielland Network in Norway, which is organising the conference, visited Cumbria in 2022 to find families of those killed and met Mr Hunter's sons Wayne and Alan.
Wayne Hunter said he had ""missed"" having a father and spent years trying to bury the pain.
But now he said he and his brother wanted answers about what happened to their father, who is remembered on a memorial stone along with four other men from Cleator Moor killed in the disaster.
He told the BBC: ""[We want] answers so we can move on in life.
""The truth is massive, everyone deserves the truth, it will be part of closure.""
Mr Reme said he hoped British families would create a network like that in Norway to apply political pressure, adding: ""The push for more answers will be stronger if we connect.
""Fighting for facts is a very important element in the healing process for these traumas people are experiencing.""
More than 20 British relatives are due to attend the three-day conference.

Dutch Grand Prix 2023: Zandvoort imposes car ban on travelling F1 fans,"The Dutch Grand Prix is a petrolhead event minus the petrol - but with plenty of bicycles.
The Formula One (F1) event is taking place in a tiny coastal town which is locked down to visitors' cars for the entire weekend, with many fans arriving by bicycle. 
Perched atop a ladder on the edge of the train platform, a man dressed head to toe in orange directs processions of F1 enthusiasts arriving in Zandvoort. 
We're funnelled up steps and through a narrow walkway.
Streets leading from the train to the track are decked out with orange bunting and many of the residents have set up makeshift bars, providing tunes and cold drinks from their verandas.  
This weekend, Zandvoort, with its modest 17,000 inhabitants, is welcoming approximately 300,000 visitors.
A self-proclaimed orange army trundles through the streets and dunes, propelled by pedal power and the prospect of seeing homegrown hero Max Verstappen in action.
The only driving within the boundaries of the small seaside community this weekend will be done by residents and authorised event-related traffic. Even the police, paramedics and security are patrolling on bicycles. 
The Dutch event aspires to be the most sustainable on the F1 calendar. Almost a third of supporters are expected to arrive by public transport, a third by bicycle or scooter, and the rest will travel by foot, coach or cab.
A train every five minutes is running between Amsterdam Central and Zandvoort, and a fleet of electric buses ferries fans to stops just outside the paddock. 
I caught the ""Max Express"" into the town from Haarlem. 
Thousands of bike parking spaces have also been provided, and even officials from the top F1 teams are hopping on the saddle to whiz around the periphery.
Outside the entrance, friends Zoë and Amber are leaning against railings, cameras poised, hoping to catch a glimpse of local legend Verstappen.
""It's mostly for Max,"" Amber explains. ""But I also just love the feeling here, it's like a big party... a festival and we all are one.""
""And the noise, so loud,"" her friend Zoë chips in. ""You're almost deaf afterwards but it's worth it.""
Amber attempts an impression of an F1 car passing, the distinctive roar of an internal combustion engine evokes an emotion and energy that drives supporters' love of the sport.
But the teenage fans recognise the need for the sport to clean up its act. 
Amber travelled to the event by train. ""No matter where you are in the Netherlands, you can travel here by bike. Having green credentials is making people aware, we are trying to make things better.""
""Orange is the new green,"" she adds.
Zandvoort has been praised by F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali for delivering ""fresh air"", and helping to set a precedent for modern era Grand Prix events.
The sport is under pressure to cut its climate impact. According to the industry's own statistics, in 2019 it accounted for approximately 256,000 tons of CO2 emissions - the equivalent of a small nation.
There's a goal, to achieve climate neutrality by 2030, but many, including the German driver Sebastian Vettel, have claimed the fast-paced industry could afford to accelerate on the sustainability front.
Efforts are being made to reuse, repurpose and recycle race materials, provide solar panels and water refill stations in the paddock. Fans in Zandvoort show me a token the size of a coin: if you bring the empty can or bottle back to be recycled, you get a token to secure a discount on your next drink. 
But the real challenge lies with travel logistics beyond the racecourse, which account for two-thirds of F1's carbon footprint. A crammed calendar featuring 23 races in the 2023 slate won't help to curb those figures. 
In terms of switching to electric vehicles or alternative biofuels, initial experiments have proved promising but limited.
And one part of Zandvoort that won't be green is the race itself.
Gallons of petrol will be burned on the track, nestled between the Dutch North Sea coast and an expansive nature reserve, some 15 miles (25km) west of Amsterdam.
Environmentalists recently lost a lawsuit to stop races at the picturesque circuit. In a plethora of cases, activists demanded that permits for the expansion be overturned, asserting that builders had destroyed sensitive dune reserves where the rare natterjack toad and sand lizard live and breed. They also said that activities at the track throughout the year caused considerably more pollution than the organisers acknowledged in their applications for permits. 
Their cases had been dismissed by a lower court in 2021, and in July, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no legal justification to reverse this ruling. However, the court recommended that provincial authorities reassess the concerns of the activists in considering whether the circuit would need a new environmental permit in the future.
A sea of orange, punctuated by black and white chequered leggings, and the colours of the Dutch flag pave the route back to the train station. 
Considering an estimated 95,000 fans attended on Friday, the fact there seemed to be a seat for everyone on the train suggests the mobility plan is working.
Sustainability measures promoted by the Dutch prove that tracks can do more to preserve the environment without sacrificing profits or pleasure. And that may encourage countries without an existing embedded cycling culture and infrastructure to accelerate investment to support greener ambitions.

Spain Hermoso: Fans and players protest over Rubiales kiss,"This video can not be played
Protesters rallied at the Spanish Football Federation HQ to demand the resignation of Luis Rubiales after he kissed Jenni Hermoso on the lips, following Spain's World Cup win.
Hermoso, a midfielder, has said the kiss was not consensual. But Rubiales, who is president of the Spanish Football Federation, denies this and says it was ""spontaneous"" and ""mutual"".
The incident has sparked a flurry of 81 players stating they will not play for Spain's women's team until Rubiales is removed from his post.

The science behind the Fukushima waste water release,"Japan has begun releasing treated radioactive water from its damaged Fukushima power plant into the Pacific Ocean - 12 years after a nuclear meltdown.
That's despite China slapping a ban on Japanese seafood and protests in Japan itself and South Korea.
The UN's atomic regulator says the water will have ""negligible"" radiological impact on people and the environment. 
But is it safe?
An earthquake followed by a tsunami in 2011 wrecked the nuclear power plant, destroying its cooling system and causing reactor cores to overheat and contaminate water within the facility with highly radioactive material. 
Since the disaster, power plant company Tepco has been pumping in water to cool down the reactors' fuel rods. This means every day the plant produces contaminated water, which is stored in more than 1,000 tanks, enough to fill more than 500 Olympic swimming pools.
Japan says it needs the land occupied by the tanks to build new facilities to safely decommission the plant. It has also raised concerns about the consequences if the tanks were to collapse in a natural disaster. 
Japan is releasing the waste water into the ocean gradually, with a green light from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The first release is one of four, scheduled between now and the end of March 2024. The entire process will take at least 30 years.
If Japan was able to remove all radioactive elements from the waste water before piping it into the ocean, perhaps it would not have been so controversial.
The problem is being caused by a radioactive element of hydrogen called tritium, which can't be removed from the contaminated water because there is no technology to do it. Instead, the water is diluted.
The message from experts is, overwhelmingly, that the release is safe - but not all scientists agree on the impact it will have.
Tritium can be found in water all over the world. Many scientists argue if levels of tritium are low, the impact is minimal.
But critics say more studies on how it could affect the ocean bed, marine life and humans are required.
The IAEA, which has a permanent office at Fukushima, said an ""independent, on-site analysis"" had shown that the tritium concentration in the water discharged was ""far below the operational limit of 1,500 becquerels per litre (Bq/L)"".
That limit is six times less than the World Health Organization's limit for drinking water, which is at 10,000 Bq/L, a measure of radioactivity. 
On Friday, Tepco said seawater samples taken on Thursday afternoon showed radioactivity levels were well within safe limits, with a tritium concentration below 1,500 Bq/L. 
Japan's environment ministry said it had also collected seawater samples from 11 different locations on Friday and would release the results on Sunday.
James Smith, professor of environment and geological sciences with Portsmouth University, said that ""in theory, you could drink this water"", because the waste water is already treated when it is stored and then diluted.
And physicist David Bailey, who runs a French laboratory measuring radioactivity, agreed, adding: ""The key thing is how much tritium is there.
""At such levels, there is no issue with marine species, unless we see a severe decline in fish population, for instance,"" he said.
But some scientists say we cannot predict the impact of releasing the water.
American professor Emily Hammond, an expert in energy and environmental law with George Washington University, said: ""The challenge with radionuclides (such as tritium) is that they present a question that science cannot fully answer; that is, at very low levels of exposure, what can be counted as 'safe'?
""One can have a lot of faith in the IAEA's work while still recognising that compliance with standards does not mean that there are 'zero' environmental or human consequences attributed to the decision.""
The US National Association of Marine Laboratories released a statement in December 2022 saying it was not convinced by Japan's data.
And marine biologist Robert Richmond, from the University of Hawaii, told the BBC: ""We've seen an inadequate radiological, ecological impact assessment that makes us very concerned that Japan would not only be unable to detect what's getting into the water, sediment and organisms, but if it does, there is no recourse to remove it... there's no way to get the genie back in the bottle.""
Environmental groups such as Greenpeace go further, referring to a paper published by scientists at the University of South Carolina in April 2023.
Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace East Asia, says tritium can have ""direct negative effects"" on plants and animals if ingested, including ""reduced fertility"" and ""damage to cell structures, including DNA"".
China has banned Japanese seafood as a result of the waste water release. Some media commentators believe this could be a political move, especially as experts say there is no scientific evidence backing concerns around seafood, as the radiation released is so low. 
But many people who are exposed to the Pacific Ocean every day have concerns.
Traditional female divers in South Korea, known as ""haenyeo"", tell the BBC they are anxious. 
""Now I feel it's unsafe to dive in,"" says Kim Eun-ah, who has been doing the job off Jeju Island for six years. ""We consider ourselves as part of the sea because we immerse ourselves in the water with our own bodies,"" she explains.
Experts say the waste water could be carried by ocean currents, particularly the cross-Pacific Kuroshio current.
And fishermen have told the BBC they fear their reputation has been permanently damaged and worry for their jobs. 
The Pacific Islands Forum Chair and Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown, like the IAEA, says he believes it ""meets international safety standards"". 
He added all nations across the region may not agree on the ""complex"" issue, but urged them to ""assess the science"".

Wagner in Africa: Precarious future after Prigozhin's reported death,"Cradling a rifle, dressed in a military uniform and with a desert in the background, Yevgeny Prigozhin had a message for Africa.
His Wagner group of mercenaries was ""making Russia even greater on every continent - and Africa even more free"". ""Justice and happiness for the African nations,"" he declared. 
The video, thought to be recorded in Mali, was released on Monday. Two days later, the Wagner leader was reported to have died in a plane crash in Russia.
What now for his purported mission in Africa?
Wagner has been active in several countries on the continent - most notably the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali. But for many African governments, Prigozhin's announced death is a relief.
I would argue that his operatives did not spread freedom, and foreign mercenaries are an embarrassment for many states - Prigozhin was a reminder of a painful past. 
At the height of the Cold War, and especially shortly after independence on the continent, mercenaries were regularly used to influence the civil wars and violence that followed. 
Col Callan in Angola; Bob Denard in Congo's Katanga and later the Comoros; ""Mad"" Mike Hoare in Katanga and later the Seychelles; American Robert Mackenzie in Sierra Leone and British Simon Mann's failed ""organised regime change"" mission in Equatorial Guinea in 2004: all these are uncomfortable history.
When I discussed Prigozhin with Russian African analysts in Moscow in late 2019, they reminded me that for them, he was less of the above, but more akin to the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, who was out to make a fortune, and that I should not be judgmental, given the UK's history. 
Prigozhin's Wagner footprint in Africa was built on blood and treasure - contracts giving access to valuable resources were made in payment for military support.
I had witnessed similar Private Military Companies (PMCs) in action some 20-plus years ago: Sandline International in Sierra Leone and Executive Outcomes in Angola. 
They provided security and training in exchange for payment in management of mines, oil and other natural resource endowments. 
Their success dramatically varied, depending on the client and the contract.  
There is nothing unique about Wagner and its operational behaviour in Africa. 
When I met with some of its operatives in Moscow in 2019, they were traumatised and seeking compensation for a mission in Mozambique that went badly wrong. 
This was the antithesis to the Prigozhin-funded movie Granit that premiered on the pro-Kremlin NTV channel in December 2022. It depicted a group of Russian hero ""military instructors"" invited to Mozambique to fight Islamic State-linked insurgents in the country's north.
Its operations in Libya, Sudan, Mali and CAR have produced mixed results. 
Wagner's greatest military success is probably acting as a Praetorian guard for the presidency and foiling a military coup in CAR's capital, Bangui. 
Its greatest failure: possibly in Mozambique. Wagner deployed there in September 2019 for counter-insurgency operations, but the killing of seven of its personnel and 20 Mozambican special forces in October in a friendly fire exchange resulted in their withdrawal in early 2020. 
Wagner's investments in fake news and trolling, encouraging deeper anti-Western sentiment in West Africa, have been more successful than its efforts to win elections in Madagascar, Mozambique or Zambia.
It is currently most militarily active in Sudan and Mali. 
Wagner has had a presence in Sudan since 2017, providing security services and overseeing gold mining concessions. 
The US Treasury Department alleges that Wagner has also been supplying Sudan's Rapid Support Forces with surface-to-air missiles recently. 
In September 2021, the Malian junta struck a security agreement with Wagner for the deployment of 1,000 personnel at a monthly cost of $10.8m (£8.6m).
The Wagner Group's counter-terrorism performance has been underwhelming and there are allegations of serious human rights abuses by them, especially in central Mali. 
Although the group's deployment in Mali has provoked criticism from the region and the African Union (AU), Wagner still sought to expand its operations to Burkina Faso. 
An offer in late 2022 was rejected, but Russia continues to woo the junta, whose leader Captain Ibrahim Traore attended the second Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg in July this year. Burkina Faso is one of six African countries to receive free grain from Moscow. 
Soon after the September 2022 coup in Burkina Faso that resulted in Capt Traore taking over the military government, Prigozhin described him as ""a truly courageous son of the motherland"". 
The Wagner leader also hailed Niger's military coup in July this year as good news and offered his fighters' services to bring order.
But in the wake of his failed uprising in Russia in June, Wagner's grip on its African operations was under threat.
According to President Vladimir Putin, Prigozhin had returned to Russia from Africa on the day of his death and had gone to meet Russian officials in Moscow. It seems he may have been trying to preserve his Wagner Africa portfolio from full Kremlin takeover. 
Mr Putin described Prigozhin as a talented person. 
""[He] worked in our country, but also abroad, in Africa. He worked with oil, gas, with precious metals,"" the president said.
Pan-African dismay about mercenaries began as soon as they became active in the decolonisation conflicts of the 1960s. In 1977, the African Convention on Mercenarism was signed in Libreville and took effect in April 1985. 
In February 2022, the African Union's commissioner for political affairs, peace and security, Bankole Adeoye, called for the ""complete exclusion of mercenaries from the African continent"".
These conventions may be ineffective, but an increasing number of African governments do not want a repeat of the use of foreign mercenaries on African soil to pursue geopolitical rivalries of external powers that occurred during the Cold War. 
Mozambique discovered that the use of private military contractors was not so effective and turned to Rwanda for assistance. 
Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi concluded that an effective, disciplined military was needed to assist his own armed forces, and the Rwandan Defence Forces (RDF) has been successful, significantly reducing the insurgency. 
The worsening security situation across the Sahel also resulted in Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, along with West African allies, drawing up plans for the strengthening of a regional standby force - in effect, a regional counter-terrorism and anti-coup force. 
The African-led and designed security initiatives are an explicit rejection of mercenaries.
But for those military governments in the region, in Mali, Burkina Faso and now Niger, the Russian operatives may be an attractive alternative.
Wagner, if it survives, or other emerging Russian mercenary groups, will increasingly find the market limited to putschist regimes using them as the security partner of last resort. 
The Kremlin, which will not desert the likes of CAR and Mali, is likely to try to take over operations, but its ability to seriously take on new clients, as Prigozhin had envisioned, will be difficult. 
This is the moment for African leaders to truly implement African solutions to African problems, by implementing its conventions and building up institutions and credible, accountable security forces.
Alex Vines directs the Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank.

"Pakistan cable car: From panic to relief, survivors recall harrowing ordeal","This video can not be played
Watch: Drone shows people trapped in Pakistan cable car
It started out a routine Tuesday morning. Car mechanic Gulfaraz had planned to accompany his nephew to school and then go home. 
They made the journey as they had done for years - on a makeshift cable car that would take them across the steep Allai valley in the northwest of Pakistan.
But minutes into their ride, two cables supporting their car snapped.
They were trapped in the car with six other passengers, dangling hundreds of metres above the ground, buffeted by gusty winds.
""It felt like we were standing right at the edge of our own graves,"" Gulfaraz, 20, told BBC Urdu the next day. ""We had little to no hope that we could be saved."" 
The cable wires snapped at about 07:30 local time (02:30 GMT), but it was not until 14 hours later that all eight people - six teenagers among them - were pulled to safety in a complex operation involving at least four helicopters and a team of zip wire experts.
Many of the trapped passengers did not think they would survive.
""I thought it was my last day and I will be no more,"" one of the rescued boys, Attaullah Shah, told AFP.
""God has granted me a second life,"" the 15-year-old said.
Cable chair lifts are often used for commuting in this area, deep in the mountains of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. 
For students, the cable cars cut a two-hour road journey through mountainous terrain - from their village homes in Jhangra to school in Batangi - to just five minutes.
It was Gulfaraz who raised the alarm on Tuesday morning. Suspended in the air, he used his mobile phone to inform his family and friends about what had happened.
Residents used loudspeakers to alert officials, but it took at least four hours for the first rescue helicopter to arrive.
It was a delicate operation for the choppers. They could not approach the cable car too closely, fearing their rotor blades might destabilise it further. 
Each time a rescuer was lowered towards the car, it would shake, leading the children to scream in fear, eyewitnesses told local media.
Recalling the agony of the situation, Gulfaraz said: ""Once when the helicopter came close to rescue the kids, the rescuer's rope got stuck with the cable car. 
""And it started swaying with the helicopter, we toppled upside down, the ones who were sitting fell off their seats, the ones who were standing fell down.
""I was really stressed out myself and I had to take care of the kids too. They were very scared, some were screaming, others were crying,"" he said.
A child said to have a heart condition had fainted, he added.
Drone footage obtained by the BBC shows passengers piled on top of one another, clinging to their seats, many looking visibly distressed. The car was suspended lopsided with its doors flung open.
By then, anxious crowds, including relatives of those trapped, had gathered on both sides of the ravine. Parents begged officials to save their children while other onlookers watched with bated breath as military choppers attempted the rescue. 
Local police officers described the scene as a ""complete chaos"".
After several failed attempts, a helicopter finally lifted one child off the car. Footage online shows the child clinging on to a rope suspended from the chopper, swinging mid-air for 20 seconds before being pulled into the helicopter.  
By then, it was about 19:00 local time and the rescue mission hit another hurdle: helicopter operations had to be suspended because of poor weather and darkness.
As night fell, hopes faded of rescuing the rest of the group.
Enter the cable and zip line experts from the neighbouring town of Naran, which is a popular destination for adventure tourism.
Muhammad Ali Swati, one of the experts, said they were approached by the military and airlifted to the scene to help.
The 31-year-old, who on a normal day runs a zip line company, found himself executing a far more complex operation.
Supported by army officers and local rescuers, his team installed a chairlift and inched toward the cable car using its last remaining cable. 
The team later managed to help bring the rest of the group to safety along a zip line. 
""They were clinging to me as children cling to their mothers. Their condition was bad. They in such a state of extreme distress as they didn't think they could survive,"" Ali said.
Videos show huge crowds erupting in cheers close to midnight, as the rest of the group was brought onto land near a thicket of trees.
Pakistan's military, which concluded the rescue operation close to 23:00 local time, described the rescue as ""an operation of unprecedented difficulty"".
It remains unclear how the cables on the stranded cable car broke, but this mishap has drawn scrutiny to the makeshift cable car system widely used in Pakistan.
In most of the country's mountainous regions, makeshift chairlifts and cable cars are born of necessity, because there are few roads. 
In the Allai valley, settlements are spread far and wide and located up to 2,000m (6,562ft) above sea level. 
Residents in Jhangra village told the BBC they only had access to one school, a basic health unit with one doctor, and just a handful of shops - all on the other side of the mountain.
Nasrullah, who teaches at the school, said they used to carry people who were sick over their shoulders while walking to find medical help on the other side of the mountain.
""It used to take us at least two hours on foot. They often die on the way. But three years ago some people came and installed this cable car, which cut the distance we had to cover significantly,"" Nasrullah told the BBC.
""We have connectivity issues, we don't have bridges. It is inevitable that people are dependent on these means of travel,"" said Molvi Ghulam Ullah, another villager.
Often thrown together with scrap metal, these cars are typically built by local communities - mostly illegally, because it is faster and cheaper. 
While the fare varies depending on the distance being travelled, it begins from as little as 20 PKR (£0.053; $0.067).
But that efficiency and affordability come at the cost of safety. Tuesday's incident, unfortunately, was not unprecedented. 
In June, a woman and her infant daughter drowned when the cable supporting the chair lift they were travelling in broke across the Swat valley, also in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province.
Last December, 12 students were stuck mid-air in northern Pakistan during a similar incident. They were rescued after two hours. And in 2017, 10 people died after a cable car they were riding fell into a ravine in the mountain resort city of Murree.
Pakistani authorities have arrested the owner and operator of the cable car that broke on Tuesday. They said a substandard rope had endangered the lives of passengers. 
But villagers say developing transport infrastructure in the area will be a more sustainable solution.
""We request the government to construct a road as soon as possible so we do not have to rely on cable cars to get to the other side,"" said Nasrullah, the teacher.
As of now, some concerned parents are reconsidering this makeshift form of transport.
Speaking to the BBC, Gulfaraz's nephew said: ""My parents have forbidden me from taking the cable car now, even if it means walking all the way. 
""They said God saved me this time, but it is too dangerous.""

Gladstone family urged to pay slavery reparations to Jamaica,"The descendants of former Prime Minister William Gladstone are facing calls to pay reparations to Jamaica for an ancestor's role in slavery.
The Gladstone family apologised for its slaveholding past in Guyana and pledged to fund research into slavery and other projects at a ceremony on Friday.
But the family has been accused of failing to acknowledge the case for paying slavery reparations in Jamaica.
The family told the BBC: ""At the moment we are solely focused on Guyana.""
""There is a huge amount to do here [in Guyana],"" the Gladstones said.
John Gladstone - the father of William Gladstone, one of the UK's most revered prime ministers - was one of the largest slave owners in the British West Indies.
The University of London's (UCL) Legacies of British Slavery database shows John Gladstone owned or held mortgages over 2,508 enslaved Africans in Guyana and Jamaica in the 19th Century.
He was paid more than £100,000 in compensation after the British Parliament passed a law to abolish slavery in most British colonies in 1833, receiving £15,052 for 806 enslaved people in Jamaica.
Reading the family's apology to Guyana, Charlie Gladstone, the great-great-grandson of William Gladstone, condemned slavery as ""a crime against humanity"" and acknowledged ""slavery's continuing impact on the daily lives of many"".
He said the family supported a 10-point reparations plan proposed by Caribbean nations.
But there was no mention of John Gladstone's slave ownership in Jamaica at the ceremony in Guyana on Friday, nor in the family's statement announcing their intention to apologise and make donations last week.
John Gladstone owned ""significant properties"" in Jamaica, said Verene Shepherd, director of the Centre for Reparation Research at the University of the West Indies.
She said the Gladstone family ""must come to the scene of the crime and apologise to the people who live in those neighbourhoods"".
The Jamaican academic and professor of social history urged the Gladstone family to ""commit to reparations, as they're doing in Guyana"".
Reparations are broadly recognised as compensation given for something that was deemed wrong or unfair, and can take many forms.
Last week, the Gladstones said they would aim to donate £100,000 to the University of Guyana's International Institute for Migration and Diaspora Studies, which was launched on Friday. 
In Guyana, the family also pledged funding ""to assist various projects in Guyana"" and UCL's Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery for five years.
Prof Shepherd said: ""Now that we realise that we've been ignored, I think Jamaica should make an approach.""
The BBC has been told that Jamaica's National Council on Reparations is discussing the Gladstone case and considering what action to take.
The council has not had any contact with the Gladstone family to date.
John Gladstone was a Scottish merchant who made a fortune from his ownership of sugar plantations and enslaved workers in the decade before abolition.
His prominent involvement in the industry shaped the political career and legacy of his son, William Gladstone, whose attitude towards slavery changed over his life.
In his first speech to Parliament, the Liberal prime minister defended the rights of plantation owners, but later branded slavery the ""foulest crime"" in history.
The Gladstones are the latest British descendants of slave owners to attempt to atone for the actions of their ancestors in recent years.
The family's historic link to slavery came into sharper focus during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.
Since then, some members of the family have joined the Heirs of Slavery, a group of British people whose families profited from the transatlantic slave trade and want to make amends.
Other members include former BBC journalist Laura Trevelyan and her family, who apologised to Grenada and promised £100,000 in reparations in February this year.
In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, United Nations Judge Patrick Robinson said he had ""some scepticism about these families"".
He said the reparations paid should be based on the number of slaves John Gladstone owned and the extent to which the family benefited from this economically.
He said he would be willing to ask for a calculation from the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm that produced a report on the reparations states owe for their involvement in slavery.
""If it's not to be seen as a tokenistic exercise, if it is to be taken seriously, they must ascertain the reparations that are owed,"" Mr Robinson said.
The Brattle Group Report, which was co-authored by Mr Robinson, said the UK should pay $24tn (£18.8tn) for its slavery involvement in 14 countries.
The Gladstones should undertake a similar calculation to ""demonstrate how much is really owed"", said Robert Beckford, professor of climate and social justice at the University of Winchester.
The professor said that rather than giving money to a university for further research, he would have ""preferred them to talk to community organisers or reparations groups, to explore what is the best way forward"".
Although he welcomed the Gladstone apology in Guyana, he said the failure to acknowledge Jamaica hinted at ""an unwillingness to face up to the full brutal, bestial horror of chattel slavery"" in the country.

France to spend €200m destroying wine as demand falls,"The French government is allocating €200m (£171.6m) to destroy surplus wine and support producers.
It comes amid a cocktail of problems for the industry, including a falling demand for wine as more people drink craft beer.
Overproduction and the cost of living crisis are also hitting the industry.
Most of the €200m will be used to buy excess stock, with the alcohol sold for use in items such as hand sanitiser, cleaning products and perfume.
In a bid to cut back on the overproduction, money will also be available for winegrowers to change to other products, such as olives.
In funnelling the money into the industry, the French government aims to stop ""prices collapsing... so that wine-makers can find sources of revenue again"", Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau said. 
Despite the financial help - an initial EU fund of €160m which the French government topped up to €200m - the wine industry needs to ""look to the future, think about consumer changes ... and adapt"", he added.
European Commission data for the year to June shows that wine consumption has fallen 7% in Italy, 10% in Spain, 15% in France, 22% in Germany and 34% in Portugal, while wine production across the bloc - the world's biggest wine-making area - rose 4%.

Four people killed in County Tipperary crash,"Four people have been killed in a single vehicle crash in County Tipperary.
It happened on the Mountain Road in Clonmel at about 19:30 local time on Friday.
Gardaí (police) have said the victims were a man in his 20s who was the driver and ""three female passengers, all adult teenagers"".
The road is expected to remain closed overnight and into Saturday.
Police have appealed for witnesses to get in contact. 
They want any road users who may have camera footage (including dash-cam) and were travelling in the Mountain Road area between 19:00 and 19:45 to make the footage available to them. 
The Republic of Ireland's minister for further and higher education, Simon Harris, described it as ""devastating news"".

Niger junta gives French envoy 48 hours to leave,"Niger's coup leaders have given the French ambassador 48 hours to leave the country as bilateral ties continue to deteriorate rapidly. 
The junta said Sylvain Itte had refused to respond to an invitation to meet Niger's foreign minister.
France, a former colonial power, said the ""putschists have no authority"" to order such an expulsion.
Paris opposes July's coup, saying that ousted President Mohammed Bazoum must be returned to office.
Friday's announcement was made by Niger's foreign minister installed by the junta. 
This follows a series of statements and demonstrations hostile towards France.
The French foreign ministry responded by saying that it had ""taken note of the putschists"", the AFP news agency reported.
""The putschists do not have the authority to make this request, the ambassador's approval coming solely from the legitimate elected Nigerien authorities,"" the ministry added.
Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani, Niger's coup leader, last week pledged to return the West African nation to civilian rule within three years.
He made the announcement after meeting mediators from the West African regional bloc Ecowas in the capital, Niamey.
Ecowas has threatened military action to reverse last month's overthrow of President Bazoum if talks fail.
The junta head said that Niger did not want a war, but would defend itself against any foreign intervention.
""If an attack were to be undertaken against us, it will not be the walk in the park some people seem to think,"" he warned.
Gen Tchiani also reiterated criticism of what he called the ""illegal and inhumane"" sanctions imposed by Ecowas on the landlocked impoverished country.
This has included cutting electricity, resulting in blackouts in Niamey and other major cities, as well as blocking crucial imports. 
Lorry drivers have been stuck for weeks waiting to bring in supplies, forcing up food prices.
Ecowas rejected the three-year timeframe after talks on Sunday.
""Ecowas is not accepting any prolonged transition again in the region. They just have to get ready to hand over in the shortest possible time,"" Abdel-Fatau Musah, the bloc's commissioner for political affairs, peace and security, told the BBC. 
He said the ""military aspect is very much on"".
Regional efforts to reverse the coup have been backed by the US and France, which both have military bases in Niger. These bases are part of efforts to tackle jihadist groups in the wider Sahel region.
The junta leader, who headed the presidential guard before seizing power on 26 July, said military intervention could worsen the Islamist insurgencies linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group.
The coup mirrors similar recent takeovers in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali. 
And the influence of Russia in the wider Sahel region is also growing through its mercenary group Wagner.

88 UK deaths linked to Canada 'poison seller',"Dozens of people in the UK died after buying a poisonous substance from a seller in Canada, who is accused of helping people to take their own lives. 
The National Crime Agency (NCA) could not confirm the chemical was the direct cause of the 88 deaths but has launched a criminal investigation.
British police have been making welfare visits to hundreds of addresses to trace buyers across the country.
Kenneth Law was arrested in Toronto in May, accused of assisting suicide.
On Friday he appeared briefly in court in Brampton, Ontario, before the hearing was adjourned to 8 September.
The 57-year-old is thought to have run a number of websites selling equipment to assist suicide.
Canadian authorities believe he sent 1,200 packages to customers in more than 40 countries, though it is not known how many included the poisonous substance.
BBC News is not naming the chemical allegedly sold by Mr Law.
Peel Regional Police said they began investigating the case in April following the sudden death of an adult in the Toronto area.
Alleged links between Mr Law and deaths in the UK first surfaced in an undercover investigation by The Times the same month.
Since Mr Law's arrest, police forces across the UK have been making welfare checks on everyone who ordered the substance.  
The NCA, which was coordinating the checks, said that 272 people in the UK had been identified as buying from Mr Law over a two-year period.
The NCA says 88 of them later died, but at this stage there are no confirmed links between the items purchased from the websites and cause of death.
NCA deputy director Craig Turner said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the loved ones of those who have died. They are being supported by specially trained officers from police forces.
""In consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, the NCA has taken the decision to conduct an investigation into potential criminal offences committed in the UK. This operation is under way.""
Tom Parfett, from Maidenhead, was 22 when he ended his own life in October 2021 after buying the chemical from Mr Law.
His father David Parfett is angry at what he sees as police failures.
""It's important for families to understand what has happened and why policing worldwide allowed this scale of deaths despite clear warning signs,"" he said. 
Mr Parfett fears there other suppliers out there and unregulated websites promoting suicide.
""What can be done immediately to close down internet sites that prey on vulnerable young people and prosecute the people who take pleasure in helping others take their own life?"" he asked.
In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Parfett said his son had discussed taking his own life with people he met online in communities set up to discuss the subject, and was encouraged to do so by some.
He added: ""We have to accept that in the modern age, people can find like-minded people to discuss even the most difficult problems...those communities are unregulated and causing a huge amount of harm.""
Mr Parfett called for stronger action from police and policymakers to crack down on people selling poison, and for online communities targeting vulnerable people to be regulated.
He continued: ""We need to be more sensitive around the risks that people like Tom have in society through their ability to find information online that is unchallenged.""
Under the country's criminal code, counselling or aiding a person to die by suicide can result in a 14-year prison sentence.
A previous version of this article, using information from the NCA, said 232 people had been identified as having purchased products from Mr Law. The NCA has since clarified that the number is 272.

Georgia renames square after first black Civil War nurse,"A public square in Georgia's oldest city has been renamed after a black woman who played a major role in the US Civil War. 
Born into slavery in 1848, Susie King Taylor was highly educated at a young age despite laws banning education for black people in southern states. 
Her name replaces a pro-slavery former US vice-president.
This is the first time in 140 years that Savannah has renamed one of its town squares.
The decision by the Savannah city council comes after they considered several other names for the square - previously named after John C Calhoun - a staunch advocate for slavery in the decades preceding the US Civil War.
Taylor was taught at secret schools as a child. After fleeing slavery to find protection with Union troops, she became a teacher at the age of 14. She went on to become a nurse, an educator and the only black woman to write a memoir of the war.
She served as a military nurse, and went on to found schools for black children after the war. 
The square - the first to be named after a woman - will bear a plaque with the old name and an explanation for the change.  
""It's one thing to make history. It's something else to make sense. And in this case, we're making both,"" Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said, according to the Associated Press. 
He also noted that there are now five black women on the nine-member city council, saying that people in Taylor's lifetime ""never would have fathomed"" the sight of black women in such a role.

Madagascar crush: 12 dead at island games' opening ceremony,"At least 12 people have been killed in a crowd crush at a stadium in Madagascar's capital Antananarivo, Prime Minister Christian Ntsay says.
Another 80 people were hurt during the opening ceremony of the Indian Ocean Island Games at the Mahamasina stadium.
""There were a lot of people at the entrance,"" Red Cross official Antsa Mirado told the AFP news agency.
President Andry Rajoelina, who was at the stadium, said it was a ""tragic event"", calling for a minute's silence.
The Mahamasina stadium - with a capacity of nearly 41,000 - is reported to have been packed with spectators. 
Footage has emerged showing a number of injured people sitting dazed on the ground. Other victims are seen being carried away from the stadium.
Set up in 1977, the Indian Ocean Island Games is a multi-sport event held every four years.
The participants are the island nations and territories of Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, the Maldives and Réunion.
In 2018, one person died and nearly 40 others were injured in a crush at the Mahamasina before the start of a Madagascar-Senegal football match.
In 2016, two people were killed and about 80 injured in a grenade explosion at the same venue during Madagascar's national day celebrations. The blast happened during a free concert.
Two years earlier, a grenade explosion killed a toddler and injured several other people outside the same stadium.

Pilot killed in US military jet crash in San Diego,"A pilot was killed when a US fighter jet crashed near a military base in California, the US Marine Corps confirmed on Friday.
The F/A-18 Hornet jet crashed just before midnight local time near Marine Corps Air Station Miramar on Thursday, about 15 miles (24km) from the centre of San Diego.
Search personnel found the body of the pilot, who has not been identified. 
The Marine Corps has launched an investigation into the incident. 
""The pilot was the only person aboard the aircraft,"" Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar said in a statement. ""With a heavy heart, our condolences go to the Marine's family during this time.""
MCAS Miramar said the crash site was on government property located just east of the base. 
There were no indications of damage to property on the ground, the MCAS said.
The aircraft that crashed belonged to Marine All-Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 224, a South Carolina-based unit known as the ""Fighting Bengals"".
At the time of the incident, however, it was operating from Miramar. 
F/A-18 Hornet jets - used both by the Marine Corps and the US Navy - are all-weather fighter and attack aircraft. 
The first variants of the aircraft entered service with the Marines in 1983, and with the Navy the following year. 
While crashes involving military fighter jets are rare, they do occur periodically. In 2015, an F/A-18 belonging to the same unit crashed into a swampy area in Georgia while conducting low-altitude training. The pilot and a weapons systems officer both ejected and were treated with minor injuries. 
In another incident in 2012, a Navy F/A-18 crashed into an apartment complex in Virginia Beach, Virginia, injuring seven people. 
Four years earlier, in 2008, an F/A-18 operating from Miramar crashed into a residential area in San Diego, killing four people on the ground. The pilot ejected and survived the incident.

Kleenex is pulling out of Canada due to 'unique complexities',"Canadians with runny noses and teary eyes will soon have to part with their Kleenex after the company announced it was pulling its famous facial wipes from the country. 
Kimberly-Clark, the company behind Kleenex, said the decision was based on ""unique complexities"".
Other Kimberly Clark products like Huggies and Cottonnelle will remain on Canadian shelves. 
""The decision was incredibly difficult for us to make,"" the statement said.
The news of Kleenex's exit is ""shocking"" in a country where the brand is so well known, said David Soberman, a marketing professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. 
""In Canada, the word Kleenex is almost synonymous with a facial tissue,"" he said.  
So why the sudden goodbye? Experts like Mr Soberman told the BBC the decision almost certainly came down to the bottom line. 
""No company pulls out of a market if they're making money,"" Mr Soberman said. ""Whatever they want to say, they could have just said 'we're not making any money in Canada, that's why we're pulling out of facial tissues'.""
Part of Kleenex's problem, Mr Soberman said, was likely the popularity of Scotties, the facial tissue produced by the Canadian company Kruger. 
""They [Kleenex] really are the second place brand in Canada to Scotties,"" he said, noting Scotties' major Canadian sponsorship deals, like its presence in women's curling.  
But this is not the first time a big brand name has abandoned Canada. Beloved American snacks like Bugles, Bagel Bites and Little Debbie products have also said goodbye in recent years. 
Economists told the BBC that may be because Canada's market is not all that friendly to foreign business. 
According to the World Economic Forum's competitiveness index, CEOs most frequently complain about Canada's inefficient government bureaucracy and high taxes - at least compared to the US. 
""The US market is easier than Canada's for a variety of reasons,"" said Walid Hejazi, an economics professor also at the Rotman School. 
First, Mr Hejazi said, is the sheer size of the US - almost 10 times as many people to buy, sell and manufacture products. 
More readily available credit, less government regulation and more investment in research and development are other reasons the US can be a more attractive market than Canada.  
""Another huge one is in Canada is there's so much protectionism, I think this is the biggest one,"" Mr Hejazi said. In Canada, all three of the biggest industries - airlines, telecom and finance - are heavily protected by the federal government, he said. 
While Canadian companies may benefit, that home court advantage may help drive out US and other foreign companies from travelling up north. 
And now, it means, Canadians will have to save their tears - at least for another brand of facial tissue.

"Most wanted terrorist killed, says Mozambique","The government of Mozambique says its armed forces have killed the leader of a jihadist group linked to Islamic State which is fighting in the north of the country.  
The defence ministry said Bonomade Machude Omar - also known as Ibn Omar - had led the insurgents since the start of the conflict in 2017.
A statement said he was killed along with two other senior members.
There has been no independent confirmation of the deaths.
Two years ago, the US state department designated Omar as a terrorist leader, blaming him for attacks in Cabo Delgado province, including the killing of dozens of people at a hotel in Palma.
A month before that, Mozambique's military launched a major offensive against the Islamists with the support of hundreds of soldiers from Rwanda and several southern African countries.
According to the government, Omar and two associates from the Islamic State-linked group were killed in a forest in Macomia in an operation carried out with the army's foreign allies.
It happened on Tuesday, said Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi during a news conference on Friday.
The UN says the violence in northern Mozambique has forced more than a million people to flee their homes.
The violence has also forced a multi-billion-dollar gas project to be put on hold. 
The gas and ruby-rich province of Cabo Delgado has been a magnet for Islamists seeking to exploit its lucrative natural resources. Numerous multinational companies operate in the area.
Yet there are high levels of poverty among local Mozambicans, while disputes over access to land and jobs have contributed to local grievances which are readily exploited by jihadist recruiters.
Rights groups say since the conflict began more than five years ago, civilians have suffered horrendous abuses from government security forces and jihadist fighters.

Bodies and flight recorders recovered at Wagner boss Prigozhin's jet crash site,"This video can not be played
Watch: Putin's first words on Prigozhin plane crash
Russia says 10 bodies and flight recorders have been recovered from the scene of a jet crash presumed to have killed Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. 
""Molecular-genetic tests are now being carried out,"" investigators say.
The plane crashed near Moscow on Wednesday, prompting speculation that a bomb or a missile was to blame. 
Claims that the Kremlin gave an order to kill Prigozhin were a ""complete lie"", Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman told the BBC earlier.
Prigozhin - once a Putin loyalist - led an aborted armed revolt by his mercenary fighters in June.
Mr Putin at the time described the mutiny as ""treachery"", but a deal was later struck for Wagner mercenaries to either join Russia's regular army or go to Belarus - Moscow's ally. 
Even so, in the wake of the rebellion, many observers described Prigozhin, 62, as a ""dead man walking"", arguing that the Russian president would never forgive the Wagner boss. 
During Friday's conference call with journalists, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the BBC there was ""lots of speculation"" around the ""tragic"" deaths of all 10 people in Wednesday's air crash in the Tver region, north-west of the Russian capital.
Prigozhin and his right-hand man Dmitry Utkin, as well as five other passengers and three crew members, were on board of the Embraer Legacy 600 jet, according to the passenger list.
""In the West, of course, this speculation comes from a certain angle. It's all a complete lie,"" Mr Peskov went on.  
""We don't have many facts at the moment, the facts need to be clarified during the official investigation which is being carried out now,"" he added.
And despite the jet's manifest, Mr Peskov refused to be drawn on whether the Kremlin had confirmation that Prigozhin was definitely on board the downed plane.
The future of Wagner itself has also been thrown further into doubt by Prigozhin's presumed death.
On Friday, Belarus' leader Aleksander Lukashenko said that up to 10,000 Wagner fighters would continue to be based in the country.
However, many experts believe that Mr Lukashenko takes orders from the Kremlin.
President Putin stayed silent over the crash for almost 24 hours, before expressing condolences to all the victims' families.
He also described Prigozhin as a ""talented person"" who ""made serious mistakes in life"".
But from the moment the plane came down, there has been frenzied speculation about what caused the crash. 
The Pentagon says it believed the Wagner chief was probably killed, while a US official told CBS News that the most likely cause of the crash was an explosion on board the plane. 
President Joe Biden said on Friday that the US was still trying to ""nail down"" precisely what brought down the plane.

William Gladstone's family apologises for role in slave trade,"A descendant of William Gladstone has visited Guyana to apologise for his family's part in the slave trade.
The 19th Century prime minister was the son of John Gladstone, one of the largest slave owners in the British West Indies.
Charlie Gladstone, the great-great-great grandson of John, spoke at the University of Guyana on Friday.
But his speech was interrupted by protesters with placards at the back of the room.
Pictures posted on social media by local press appeared to show about a dozen demonstrators holding up handwritten signs calling for reparations. 
Mr Gladstone, whose family's ancestral home is the Hawarden estate, in Flintshire, proceeded to read from a prepared statement despite the demonstration in the George Walcott lecture theatre.
""Slavery was a crime against humanity and its damaging impact continues to be felt across the world today,"" he said.
""It is with deep shame and regret that we acknowledge our ancestors involvement in this crime, and with heartfelt sincerity that we apologise to the descendants of the enslaved in Guyana.
""In so doing we acknowledge slavery's continuing impact on the daily lives of many.""
He added that it was too late to change history.
""But we believe we can have an impact on the world in which we live, and in apologising for the actions of our ancestors we hope to work toward a better future.""
He urged the UK government to enter discussions with The Caribbean Community (Caricom), an intergovernmental organisation of 15 states through the Americas and Atlantic.
""We also urge other descendants of those who benefited from slavery to open conversations about their ancestors' crimes and what they might be able to do build a better future,"" Mr Gladstone said.
Mr Gladstone's visit coincided with the 200th anniversary of the 1823 rebellion in Demerara, a British colony that later became part of Guyana, which started on one of Gladstone's plantations.
Some historians argue its violent suppression had a role in bringing an end to slavery.
The Atlantic slave trade saw millions of Africans enslaved and forced to work, especially on plantations in the Caribbean and Americas, for centuries from about 1500.
The British government and the monarchy were prominent participants in the trade, alongside other European nations.
Britain also had a key role in ending the trade through Parliament's passage of a law to abolish slavery in 1833.
Rishi Sunak has refused to apologise for the UK's role in slavery.
Asked at Prime Minister's Questions in April by Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy whether he would offer a ""full and meaningful apology"", Mr Sunak said he would not, and that it was important to ""have a society that is inclusive and tolerant of people from all backgrounds"".
""Trying to unpick our history is not the right way forward and is not something we will focus our energies on,"" he said.

Denmark plans jail term for burning Quran in public,"The Danish government has proposed a ban on setting the Quran alight in public after a series of burnings led to uproar in Muslim countries.
Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard said such burnings harmed Denmark and risked the safety of Danes.
The planned law will make improper treatment of the Quran or Bible a criminal offence punishable by a fine and jail sentence of up to two years.
The centre-right government said it wanted to send a signal to the world.
Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Denmark had witnessed 170 demonstrations in recent weeks, including the burning of copies of the Quran in front of foreign embassies. 
Denmark's PET intelligence service has warned that the latest incidents have intensified the terrorist threat. 
Neighbouring Sweden has also seen a series of Quran burnings and its security service has warned of a worsening security situation. In July, the Swedish embassy in Iraq was set alight by protesters.
But both Denmark and Sweden have hesitated to respond to the burnings because of their liberal laws on freedom of expression. Sweden scrapped its blasphemy laws in the 1970s.
Copenhagen decided to move after further Quran burnings at the end of July in Denmark and Sweden. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) called on its members to take appropriate action against countries where the Quran was being desecrated.
The justice minister was adamant the proposed change in the law was not targeting verbal or written expressions or satirical drawings. But he said burning religious texts served no other purpose than creating division and hatred.
""It is a cornerstone of our democracy that you have the right to express yourself,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Jakob Ellemann-Jensen. ""You also have to behave properly."" 
Denmark could not stand idly by when such actions had negative consequences for its security, he added.
Sweden's prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said Stockholm would not take the same step as its neighbour, because that would probably require amending the constitution. 
Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer told reporters that a decision to review its public order law was the right move. The government wants to change the law to ban gatherings that threaten Sweden's public security.
Ministers in Denmark intend to propose changes to the law on 1 September and have them passed by parliament before the end of the year.
The ban is expected to be added to a section of the criminal code that bans public insult of a foreign state, its flag or other symbol.

US condemns Israeli minister Ben Gvir's 'inflammatory' Palestinian comments,"The US has condemned Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir for claiming his rights in the occupied West Bank are more important than those of Palestinians.
The state department said it strongly condemned the ""inflammatory comments"" and ""all racist rhetoric"". 
His remarks on Israeli TV sparked a storm of criticism online.
Mr Ben Gvir has since called the coverage ""fake news"" and attacked the ""radical left"" for ""misquoting"" him.
On X, the platform previously known as Twitter, Mr Ben Gvir on Friday also launched a scathing attack on the Palestinian-American model Bella Hadid for reposting a clip of his comments, calling her an ""Israel hater"" who made him look ""racist and dark"". 
Ms Hadid had reposted the video on Instagram where she has 60 million followers, adding the comment: ""In no place, no time… should one life be more valuable than another's.""
Mr Ben Gvir leads the ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit or ""Jewish Power"" party which espouses racist, anti-Arab policies. He has previous convictions for inciting racism and supporting terrorism. 
In December he was made a top minister by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who gave him a seat in his security cabinet and put him in charge of the domestic police, as well as Israel's militarised border police force that operates in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank. 
His comments on Wednesday came amid spiralling violence in which Palestinian gunmen killed three Israelis in separate attacks, including one close to the West Bank city of Hebron, where Mr Ben Gvir lives in a Jewish settlement.
It led to even further restrictions on movement for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians as Israeli forces searched for the gunmen. 
""My right, my wife's, my children's, to roam the roads of Judea and Samaria are more important than the right of movement of the Arabs,"" said Mr Ben Gvir, using a biblical term for the West Bank.
He then addressed Mohammad Magadli, an Arab Israeli journalist in the studio, saying: ""Sorry Mohammad, but this is the reality, that's the truth. My right for life comes before their right to movement.""
A video clip of the comments went viral online and sparked a backlash, including from Palestinians and Israeli opposition figures. 
The Palestinian Authority leadership condemned ""in the strongest terms the racist and heinous remarks by Israel's fascist minister Itamar Ben Gvir, which only confirms Israel's apartheid regime of Jewish supremacy and racial terror against the Palestinian people"".
It called for Mr Ben Gvir and other Israeli officials to be ""sanctioned and held accountable"".
Karine Elharrar, an Israeli MP in the opposition Yesh Atid party, described the minister as ""the authentic representative of the most racist, messianic and Kahanist government we've ever had"".
Mr Ben Gvir's political background lies in Kahanism - a violently racist movement that supports the expulsion of Palestinians from their lands. 
Pressed by Israeli journalists for a response, a US state department spokesman on Thursday night said: ""We strongly condemn Israeli minister Ben Gvir's inflammatory comments on the freedom of movement of Palestinian residents in the West Bank.""
""We condemn all racist rhetoric; as such messages are particularly damaging when amplified by those in leadership positions and are incongruent with advancing respect for human rights for all."" 
Later on Friday, the EU also ""strongly condemned"" Mr Ben Gvir's comments, saying ""the values of democracy and respect for human rights stand central to the EU-Israel partnership, including as regards the people living under occupation in the Palestinian territory"". 
Palestinians in the West Bank already endure severe restrictions on the right to movement, including being unable without permits to freely travel to Jerusalem or their ancestral lands inside Israel. The Israeli authorities say this is done for security reasons. 
Parties representing Arab Israelis, or Palestinian citizens of Israel, as well as Israeli anti-occupation groups condemned Mr Ben Gvir but argued that he was simply articulating longstanding realities in the West Bank. 
Addressing the US state department response, Arab Israeli MP Ahmed Tibi said: ""Ben Gvir… described bluntly, as a top Israeli minister, the general and sweeping Israeli policy since 1967. Why are you crying out following the description of racist apartheid reality, and not… the reality as it is?""
B'tselem, an Israeli non-governmental organisation which provides support for Palestinians living under Israel's military occupation, said: ""This is the reality we see on the ground, every day, for five decades. The rights of the Jews are more important than the rights of the Arabs, this is what apartheid looks like.""
In a likely nod to the global response to his comments, Mr Ben Gvir posted a statement in English on Thursday blaming the ""Israeli radical left"" for ""selectively"" misquoting him.
He said: ""This is how fake news is spread: I said yesterday on a TV broadcast that the right of Jews to live and not be murdered in terror attacks prevails over the right of Arabs in Judea and Samaria to travel on the roads without security restrictions. That is why checkpoints should be placed on roads where regular terrorism and shooting by jihadists are committed against Jews.""
""This is exactly how the Left continues to fan the flames of incitement in the world against the Israeli government,"" he added.
Mr Netanyahu's office issued a statement on Friday evening, in a likely attempt to limit the diplomatic damage, trying to clarify the comments. 
It said: ""In order to prevent these heinous murders, Israel's security forces have implemented special security measures in these areas [of the West Bank]. This is what Minister Ben Gvir meant when he said 'the right to life precedes freedom of movement'.""
Following Monday's attack, Israeli forces set up checkpoints at entrances and exits to Hebron where they were questioning Palestinians, while they searched for the gunmen who shot dead Batsheva Nigri, a 40-year-old nursery teacher and mother of three who lived in a nearby settlement. 
On the same day, a Palestinian man was critically injured after being shot in the head by Israeli forces in a village near Nablus. Video appeared to show him unarmed and running towards an injured person before being hit by a single shot.
Last week, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy was left seriously wounded after being shot in the head by Israeli forces in East Jerusalem. Police alleged he had tried to throw a petrol bomb at them during a raid. 
The same day video showed an apparently unarmed Palestinian man said to suffer from mental health problems being shot and wounded by Israeli troops during a protest near Israel's separation barrier in Qalqilya.

Hawaii wildfires: Here's what we know about the victims,"An avid musician, loving grandmothers, and an inspiring father are among the victims of the devastating Hawaii wildfires identified and named by Maui officials.
At least 115 people have died and authorities have warned the death toll could climb in the coming days. 
Officials say identifying those lost in the wildfires is expected to be painstakingly long. 
To date, they have publicly identified 46 people who died in the blaze.  
Before families were notified, they spent days posting on social media in hopes of finding loved ones.
Here's what we know so far about those who were lost.
Joe Schilling, a 67-year-old Lahaina resident, went by many names: ""Joe, Maui Joe, Uncle Joe, Funkle"", according to a Facebook post from his sister, Penny Schilling.
""He had the hugest heart and was ready to assist anyone in need,"" she wrote. ""The last two weeks of my husband's life, Joe took off work and came over to help me during a most difficult time. I wouldn't have made it through without him."" 
Ms Schilling told local news her brother died while trying to help his elderly neighbours to safety amid the blaze. 
Joe Schilling's friend Corie Bluh told ABC News the two were texting as wildfires reached his Lahaina residence, the Hale Mahaolu Eono apartment complex. 
""We are trapped can't see a thing plus when you try to breathe it burns your lungs,"" Mr Schilling wrote. 
He is survived by his brother Dan Schilling and sister Penny. 
Buddy Jantoc, a 79-year-old Lahaina resident, was an avid musician.  
His eldest granddaughter, Keshia Alakai, told a local ABC station that ""his family and his music was everything"" to him.
His family said he toured on the US mainland with Carlos Santana, percussionist Pete Escovedo and guitarist George Benson. Dubbed ""Mr Aloha"", he would play bass guitar at hula competitions. His flat, filled with instruments, resembled a music store. 
Mr Jantoc lived at Hale Mahaolu Eono, a low-income senior housing complex. He was legally blind and had difficulty hearing.
The family started to worry when they did not hear from him. Ms Alakai told The New York Times ""I had a bad feeling"". 
""I'm hoping he was asleep,"" Shari Jantoc, his daughter-in-law, told the newspaper. ""I hope to God he did not suffer.""
Mr Jantoc is survived by two sons, multiple grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
Before authorities identified 72-year-old Lahaina resident Melva Benjamin as one of the victims, her family and friends had been posting a ""missing"" photo of her and her boyfriend on social media.
Her daughter-in-law, Janell Benjamin, shared photos of Ms Benjamin with her grandchildren, writing on Facebook: ""Can someone please wake me up from this nightmare…still holding on to hope.""
Ms Benjamin was last seen evacuating from her home. 
Online tributes poured in after her death was confirmed. Friend Bernadette Garces Kaai wrote: ""thank you for the memories and beautiful heart"". 
Alfredo Galinato was reported missing 9 August, a day after the deadly blaze swept through the historic town of Lahaina. 
His son, Joshua Galinato, posted pictures seeking information about the 79-year-old Lahaina resident. 
""We are still searching for my father and hoping for his safe return,"" he wrote.
Mr Galinato's last known location was the family's home which, along with his vehicle, went up in flames, according to his son.
A GoFundMe page for the family now says: ""We are grateful to finally hear about our father's remains but saddened that he has not joined us in safety.""
Mr Galinato's other son, John Galinato, posted a tribute saying: ""I love you and I thank you for everything you did for the family you are inspiration."" 
The family of Donna Gomes remembers the 71-year-old matriarch as a strong and independent woman.
Ms Gomes grew up in Lahaina and was trying to flee her home of 15 years when the wildfire took her life. 
""Not only have we lost our homes, but our family is also grieving the loss of our family backbone,"" wrote her oldest grandchild, Tehani Kuhaulua.
Ms Gomes had the biggest heart - full of tough love, her grandchild wrote. 
""Some of her oldest friends know her as 'the bull' - no one could tell her what to do,"" she said. 
She would have turned 72 on 15 August. 
Tony Takafua was just seven years old when he died, trapped in a car with his mother and his mother's parents, all of whom died with him.
Their bodies were discovered in a burnt car near their Lahaina home, Hawaii News Now reported. 
The family issued a statement: ""On behalf of our family, we bid aloha to our beloved parents, Faaso and Malui Fonua Tone, as well as our dear sister Salote Takafua and her son, Tony Takafua. The magnitude of our grief is indescribable, and their memories will forever remain etched in our hearts.""
Virginia Dofa, of Lahaina, was a 90-year-old grandmother. 
On 10 August, Jona Arafiles shared a post on social media requesting people to get in touch if they see ""Grandma Virginia Dofa"". 
The County of Maui and Maui Police Department later confirmed she was one of the wildfire victims.

Antigua and Barbuda country profile,"Antigua and Barbuda is one of the Caribbean's most prosperous nations, thanks to its tourism industry and offshore financial services.
But a reliance on tourism makes the nation vulnerable to downturns in the world market. 
Antigua has tangled with the United States over its online gambling industry, which at its height employed more than 4,000 people and was a major contributor to the economy. But it shrunk drastically because of US restrictions, the Antiguan government says.
The Bird family dominated the country's politics since its independence in 1981 until 1994. Underlying this stability was a succession of scandals including allegations of corruption. 
In 2009, the country's economy was rocked by news that its single biggest investor, Texan billionaire Allen Stanford, had been charged with massive fraud by the US authorities.
Most of Barbuda was devastated in 2017 by Hurricane Irma, which brought winds with speeds reaching 295 km/h (185mph) and damaged or destroyed 95% of the island's buildings.
In 2022, Prime Minister Gaston Browne announced his intention to hold a referendum on whether the country should become a republic.
Head of state: King Charles III, represented by a governor-general
Prime minister: Gaston Browne
Gaston Browne took over as prime minister when his Labour Party won the 2014 general elections after defeating the ruling United Progressive Party (UPP). He was returned to office in the 2018 and 2023 general elections. 
Mr Browne pledged to transform the financially crippled twin island nation into an ""economic powerhouse"" by attracting investment. 
His vision is to transform Antigua and Barbuda into ""a globally competitive, premier tourism and financial services economy, producing well-paying jobs and a higher standard of living for the people"".
ABS is the national TV and radio broadcaster. Ownership of private media is concentrated among a small number of companies. 
Some key dates in the history of Antigua and Barbuda:
1493 - Christopher Columbus visits Antigua and names it after the Church of Santa Maria de la Antigua in Seville, Spain.
1632 - Antigua colonised by English settlers from St Kitts.
1674 - Christopher Codrington, a sugar planter from Barbados, sets up a sugar plantation in Antigua. African slaves are transported to grow tobacco and then sugarcane on plantations. 
1860 - Barbuda reverts to the British crown. 
1871-1956 - Antigua and Barbuda administered together as part of the Leeward Islands federation. 
1958-62 - Antigua and Barbuda part of the British-sponsored West Indies Federation. 
1967 - Antigua and Barbuda become a self-governing state within the British Commonwealth, with Britain retaining control of defence and foreign affairs. 
1969 - Barbuda separatist movement comes into being. 
1972 - Sugar industry closed down. 
1981 - Antigua and Barbuda becomes independent. 
Early 1980s - Attempts made to replant sugarcane fields, but these are finally abandoned in 1985 because of financial problems. 
1983 - Antigua and Barbuda supports the US invasion of Grenada (as it has supported US sanctions against Cuba). 
1990 - Prime Minister Vere Bird's son, Vere Jr, removed from public office in the wake of allegations of gun-running.
1993 - Vere Bird resigns as prime minister and is replaced by his son, Lester.
2008 - Tourism industry rocked by shooting of British honeymoon couple in holiday cottage.
2009 - Antigua's single biggest private investor, Sir Allen Stanford, is charged with massive investment fraud by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
2011 - Two men are found guilty of murdering a honeymooning British couple shot dead in Antigua in July 2008. 
2012 - A US court finds financier Allen Stanford guilty of running a $7bn Ponzi scheme through his bank based in Antigua.
2013 - Antigua wins World Trade Organization permission to suspend American copyrights and patents, in a possible retaliatory response to US restrictions on the island's online gambling industry.
2017 - The island of Barbuda is all but flattened by Hurricane Irma. Its residents evacuated before the storm hits.
2022 - Prime Minister Gaston Browne announces his intention to hold a referendum on whether Antigua and Barbuda should become a republic.

"Historic Trump mugshot released after arrest in Atlanta, Georgia","Donald Trump has surrendered in Georgia on charges of plotting to overturn the state's 2020 election results in an arrest that saw the first ever mugshot of a former US president.
Mr Trump had to pay a bail bond of $200,000 (£160,000) to be released from the Atlanta jail while he awaits trial.
Afterwards, he described the case as ""a travesty of justice"".
It was his fourth arrest in five months in a criminal case, but this was his first police booking photo. 
Mr Trump later posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, for the first time since January 2021. He shared the address of his website and the mugshot with an all-capital letters caption: ""Election interference. Never surrender!""
He joins the ranks of American public figures who have had arrest booking photos, including Frank Sinatra, Al Capone and Dr Martin Luther King Jr.
Mr Trump argues the cases against him are politically motivated because he is leading the Republican race to challenge President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in next year's presidential election. 
The first former or serving US president ever to be indicted, he made the round trip from New Jersey on his private jet on Thursday afternoon.
Mr Trump was whisked to Fulton County Jail by a more substantial motorcade than he has used for previous court appearances this year.

Watch: Trump surrenders at Georgia jail...in 74 seconds
He was inside the facility for around 20 minutes. Dozens of his supporters gathered outside.
Records posted on the jail's website described Mr Trump as a white male, 6ft 3in, and weighing 215lbs (97kg), with blond or strawberry hair and blue eyes. His inmate number was P01135809.
Before heading home he told reporters at the airport that he was entitled to challenge the result of a vote. 
""I thought the election was a rigged election, a stolen election,"" said Mr Trump, who often makes unfounded claims of widespread ballot fraud in 2020. ""And I should have every right to do that.
Mr Trump was charged last week alongside 18 co-defendants with meddling in Georgia's election results following his loss to Mr Biden by fewer than 12,000 votes in that state.
The former president was heard in a phone call pressuring Georgia's top election official to ""find 11,780 votes"" during the ballot count.
Among the 13 charges Mr Trump faces are racketeering, soliciting a public official to violate his oath of office, conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery and making false statements. 
He denies all the counts against him. 
Each of his 18 alleged co-conspirators has been booked at Fulton County Jail in recent days ahead of a Friday deadline set by prosecutors. The list includes former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. 
One of Mr Trump's co-defendants - the leader of Black Voices for Trump, Harrison Floyd - is being held in custody after turning himself in on Thursday without a bail agreement, court officials say. 
A Georgia judge granted a speedy trial request to another co-defendant, attorney Kenneth Chesebro. His case is now due to begin on 23 October. 
Just hours before turning himself in, Mr Trump replaced his leading defence lawyer, Drew Findling, with veteran Atlanta criminal defence attorney Steven Sadow. 
One of the conditions of Mr Trump's bail release is that he refrain from any comments, on social media or otherwise, that are intended to ""intimidate"" witnesses or co-defendants. He is also not allowed to have any communication with the other co-defendants, except through his lawyers. 
Before arriving in Georgia, Mr Trump continued to criticise the prosecutor bringing the charges, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, who he accuses of trying to sabotage his White House campaign. 
Posting on his Truth Social platform, he blamed Ms Willis for murder and violent crime in Atlanta, writing that ""people are afraid to go outside to buy a loaf of bread"".
The latest police figures indicate that homicides in Atlanta have decreased by about a quarter since last year. Murders in the city spiked during the pandemic, as they did in most major US cities, but they are far from the levels seen in the 1990s.

University appoints UK's first professor of Ukrainian politics,"A university has appointed what it said is the first professor of Ukrainian politics in the English-speaking world.
Prof Olga Onuch will launch the Ukraine Rises course at the University of Manchester (UoM) in September.
She said she hoped her new title would bring her family and friends in Ukraine ""a bit of pride"". 
Volodymyr Sheiko, director general of the Ukrainian Institute in Kyiv, said it had never been ""more important for Ukraine to be genuinely understood"".
A UoM representative said Prof Onuch's expertise had led her to become one of the leading experts on Ukraine, both in the UK and internationally. 
They said that since 2014, she had been a member of an advisory group to the Ukrainian government and had worked with policymakers from Ukraine, the UK, the US, the EU and Canada.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, she published The Zelensky Effect, a book about the role of civic national identity in Ukraine and how it influenced the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky. 
The university said as well as launching the new course, which will focus on contemporary Ukrainian politics, she would also continue to teach courses on mass protest and democratisation in eastern Europe and Latin America.
Prof Onuch said she hoped ""the first professorship to name Ukrainian Politics explicitly in the English speaking world"" would bring her ""family and friends in Ukraine a bit of pride"". 
""Above all, I hope that this move is not just a first, but rather that it starts a trend,"" she said.
Mr Sheiko, whose organisation works to shape Ukraine's international image through cultural diplomacy,  said Prof Onuch's appointment was a ""crucial milestone"".
""Much of the knowledge about Ukraine, its history, politics, and culture emerges from leading academic institutions to inform public policies, curricula, and public opinion,"" he said.
He added that he was ""confident that Olga's profound experience and expertise will set a high standard for others to follow"".
Anna Dezyk, the deputy chairwoman of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, said Prof Onuch's ""enthusiasm and extensive expertise"" provided a ""fantastic platform for the study of Ukrainian politics to finally move out of the shadows and take its rightful place in academia"".
Leigh Gibson, the Ukraine director for the British Council, added that her appointment ""could not be more appropriate and richly deserved"".

China country profile,"China is one of the world's most populous countries. It has a continuous culture stretching back nearly 4,000 years and originated many of the foundations of the modern world.   
The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949 after the Communist Party defeated the nationalist Kuomintang, who retreated to Taiwan, creating two rival Chinese states - the People's Republic on the mainland and the Republic of China on Taiwan.
After stagnating for decades under the rigid totalitarian socialism of founder Mao Zedong, China reformed its economy along partly-capitalist lines to make it one of the world's fastest-growing, as well a leading exporter. 
China is now a major overseas investor, and is pursuing an increasingly assertive foreign and defence policy far beyond East Asia.
But economic change has not been matched by political reform, and the Communist Party retains a tight grip on political life and much of wider society.
President: Xi Jinping
Xi Jinping came to power in 2012-13 as the hand-picked heir of predecessor Hu Jintao. Since taking over he has concentrated power in his hands, rather than sticking with the traditional post-Mao system of collective leadership.
His position as the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong was cemented in 2017, when his name and political philosophy was written into the Communist Party constitution.
In early 2018 the party allowed him to remain in office indefinitely by abolishing the conventional two-term presidential limit. 
President Xi rejects constitutional democracy and human rights as models for China, has imposed strict limits on freedom of expression, especially on social media, tightened control over Hong Kong and  incarcerated thousands of Muslim Uyghurs in brutal ""re-education camps"".
China is the largest media market in the world.
Outlets operate under tight Communist Party control. The opening-up of the industry has extended to distribution and advertising, but not necessarily to editorial content. 
Beijing tries to limit access to foreign news by restricting rebroadcasting and the reach of satellite TV, and by blocking websites using an extensive filtering system known as the ""Great Firewall"".   
With 772 million users, China has the world's largest online population. Three powerful companies - Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - dominate the market.
Tencent's WeChat messenger has more than 900 million users worldwide.
Some key events in China's history:
16th-11th Centuries BC - Shang or Yin dynasty rules northern China: the first Chinese state for which clear written records remain. 
1046-256BC - Zhou dynasty: centralised power gradually decreases from the 8th Century onwards, with regional warlords increasingly exercising political autonomy.
475-221BC - Warring States period: China is split into seven major states, the period is characterised by warfare, as well as bureaucratic and military reforms.
221-206BC - The Chinese heartland is united for the first time under the first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, founder of the Qin dynasty.
206BC-220AD - Following civil war, the Han dynasty emerges, creating a cultural identity among still remembered in the ethnonym of the Han Chinese. The empire expands its territory with military campaigns in central Asia, Mongolia, Korea, southern China and Vietnam.
7th-13th Centuries - Under the Tang (618-690) and Song dynasties (960-1279) China's economy flourishes. It is the first country to issue paper money. Between the 10th-11th centuries, China's population doubles to 100 million mostly due to the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China.
1205-1279 - Mongol conquest of China. China's population halves during this period.
1368-1644 - Ming dynasty: follows the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. China's capital is moved from Nanjing to Beijing. China creates one of the world's strongest navies, characterised by admiral Zheng He's voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.
1644-1912 - Qing dynasty. The Manchu conquest of China (1618-1683) sees a decades long conflict between the emerging Qing dynasty, the incumbent Ming dynasty, and several smaller factions. It ends with the consolidation of Qing rule, the last imperial dynasty of China.
1839-42 and 1856-60 - Opium Wars. Fought between China, the UK and later France, triggered by China's campaign to stop opium trafficking by British merchants. European military superiority forces China to unequal treaties granting trade concessions and territory to Western powers. This begins China's ""century of humiliation"" (1839-1940s) a term used in China to describe the period of intervention and subjugation of the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China by Western powers and Japan.
1850-1864 - The Taiping Rebellion: civil war between the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the Hakka-led Taiping Heavenly Kingdom based in Nanjing. Between 20-30 million people are killed.
1862-1877 - Dungan or Tongzhi Hui Revolt, or or Hui (Muslim) Minorities War:  Uprising in western China mainly by Chinese Muslims. Results in significant population changes in northwest China. Some 21 million die due to massacres, famine and plague.
1894-95 - Sino-Japanese War:  China loses influence in Korea, which becomes a Japanese protectorate, and is forced to cede Taiwan to Japan.
1899-1901 - Boxer Rebellion or the Yihetuan Movement: an anti-foreign, anti-colonial and anti-Christian uprising. After hesitation, the Imperial government supports the Boxers. Western powers intervene with 20,000 troops and capture and loot Beijing. The Qing dynasty's handling of the rebellion further weakens their control over China.
1911-12 - Military revolts lead to the proclamation of Republic of China under Sun Yat-sen, but much of the country is taken over by warlords.
Late-1920s - The Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek, reunify much of the country and move the capital to Nanjing.
1927-37 - China is politically and militarily divided between the Kuomintang and the Communists under Mao Zedong. The Kuomintang score successes against the Red Army, which is forced to  retreat in the Long March (1934-35) to Shaanxi in northwest China.
1931 - Mukden Incident: Japan's army stages a bomb attack on railway line, blaming Chinese dissidents, and uses this as a pretext to invade Manchuria. This date is sometimes seen as the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War.
1937-45 - Second Sino-Japanese War: The 1937 Marco Polo Bridge incident sees Chinese and Japanese forces clash, leading to a full-scale Japanese invasion. Japan quickly captures Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing. Some 40,000-300,000 Chinese are killed by Japanese forces in the Nanjing massacre - which remains an issue between modern China and Japan. China's government relocates to Chongqing.
1939 - War reaches a stalemate: Japan controls major cities but lacks the forces to control the interior.
1939-45 - World War Two sees uneasy alliance between the Communists and Kuomintang.

Xinjiang profile,"Xinjiang, the largest and most westerly region of China, is bordered by eight countries including the former Soviet Central Asian republics, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. 
It experienced a brief period of independence in the 1940s, but China regained control after the Communists took power in 1949. Its full name is the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. 
It is home to the Turkic-speaking Muslim Uyghur minority. Rich in natural resources, its economic development has been accompanied by large-scale immigration of Han Chinese.
Besides Uyghurs, Xinjiang is also home to mostly Muslim communities of Kazakhs, Mongols and Hui. There are also smaller communities of other minorities such as Tajiks and Kyrgyz.
China has been accused of systematic human rights abuses against the Muslim minority, where hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs have been detained in camps.
The United Nations has accused China of ""serious human rights violations"" and possible crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.
China has denied the scale of the detentions but acknowledged that ""religious extremist"" Uyghurs are undergoing re-education and resettlement.
Xinjiang's media are tightly controlled by the local Communist Party and government. The Urumqi People's Broadcasting Station and the Xinjiang People's Broadcasting Station run radio and television broadcasts in Chinese, Uyghur and minority languages. 
The most authoritative newspaper in the region is the Chinese Communist Party-run Xinjiang Daily, which is published in Chinese, Uyghur, Mongolian and Kazakh. 
In 2017 authorities demanded that residents install an application on their mobile phones that scans the devices and reports back to authorities on what it finds.  
Key dates in Xinjiang's history:
Xinjiang has had an intermittent history of autonomy and occasional independence, but was finally brought under Chinese control in the 18th Century.
1955 - China establishes the Autonomous Region and begins to encourage Han Chinese to settle there in new industrial towns and farming villages. 
1960s - China sets up its nuclear testing facility at Lop Nur in the Tarim Basin, conducting its first test there in 1964.
The economy of this once agricultural region has developed fast since 1949, and oil and petrochemicals now account for about 60% of its GDP. It is also an important trade and pipeline route into Central Asia and beyond. 
1990s onwards - Uyghur allegations of discrimination and marginalisation by incoming Han Chinese are behind more visible anti-Han and separatist sentiment that flares into violence on occasion. 
2009 - Clashes between Uyghurs and Han Chinese in the region's main city Urumqi, in which 200 people died, prompted Beijing to send in large numbers of troops.
Early-2000s - China says the separatist Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement is behind separatist attacks. Beijing seeks to deal with the unrest with a mix of repression and efforts to stimulate the region's economy, including through increased investment by state-owned firms.
2013-14 - There is a sudden upsurge in violence, when the authorities accuse separatist ""terrorists"" of attacks in Kashgar that leave 21 dead. Exiled Uyghur groups accuse China of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression. 
2018 - Rights groups and the US State Department accused China of increasing its crackdown on the region with the aid of surveillance technology and of detaining tens of thousands in re-education camps.   
In the same year, a UN human rights panel cites ""credible reports"" that more than one million people are being held in counter-extremism centres in Xinjiang, raising concerns that China has turned the region into ""a massive internment camp shrouded in secrecy"". 
2022 - A UN report concludes that China's policies in Xinjiang may constitute crimes against humanity.

Tibet profile,"Tibet, the remote and mainly-Buddhist territory known as the ""roof of the world"", is governed as an autonomous region of China.  
Historically, Tibet was much larger than the autonomous region, being made up of three major areas - U-Tsang, Amdo and Kham. While most of U-Tsang is in China's Tibet Autonomous Region, the other two lie outside it.
Tibet's history includes periods when it was an independent entity and other times when it was ruled by powerful Chinese and Mongolian dynasties. 
Beijing claims a centuries-old sovereignty over Tibet. However, this Chinese view of imperial rule over Tibet spanning many centuries is disputed by exiled Tibetan communities and rights groups.
The allegiances of many Tibetans lie with the exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who is seen by his followers as a living god but by Beijing as a separatist threat. 
In 1950, China sent in thousands of troops to enforce its claim on Tibet. In 1959, after a failed anti-Chinese uprising, the Dalai Lama fled and set up a government in exile in India. Many of Tibet's monasteries were destroyed during China's Cultural Revolution. 
Thousands of Tibetans are believed to have been killed during periods of repression and martial law. While Tibetans' standard of living has greatly improved, Tibet remains tightly controlled by Chinese authorities.
Tibet's economy depends largely on agriculture. Forests and grasslands occupy large parts of the country. The territory is rich in minerals, but poor transport links have limited their exploitation. Tourism is an important source of revenue. 
Under international pressure, China eased its grip on Tibet in the 1980s, introducing ""Open Door"" reforms and boosting investment. 
Tourism and Beijing's modernisation drive stand in contrast to Tibet's former isolation. But critics say Tibetans have little say in building their future. 
Buddhism reached Tibet around 700AD. The Dalai Lama, or Ocean of Wisdom, is the leading spiritual figure; the Panchen Lama is the second most important figure. Both are seen as the reincarnations of their predecessors. 
However, the Dalai Lama and Beijing have been at odds over the 11th incarnation of the Panchen Lama - identifying different youngsters for the role. The Dalai Lama's choice, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, has not been seen since his detention by the Chinese authorities in 1995. 
No country openly disputes China's claim to sovereignty, and China has blocked all UN Security Council resolutions on Tibet since the People's Republic took over the China seat in the UN in 1971. 
The Tibetan cause has won the sympathy of individuals and groups, many of whom campaign for an independent Tibet to take shape.  
Key dates in the history of Tibet:

Trump seeks to make the most of historic Georgia mugshot,"The photo of Donald Trump scowling defiantly into the camera in the Fulton County Sheriff's office will go down in history.
The mugshot, the first of a former US president, came after his fourth arrest in five months.
Mr Trump posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, for the first time since January 2021 to share the address of his website and the mugshot with an all-capital letters caption: ""Election interference. Never surrender!""
Within hours, his campaign website was selling mugshot-branded mugs, t-shirts and drink coolers.
John Bolton, who served as national security advisor under Mr Trump, said the image was likely carefully staged. ""I think it's intended to be a sign of intimidation against the prosecutors and the judges,"" he told CNN. 
""He could've smiled. He could've looked benign,"" Mr Bolton added. ""Instead he looks like a thug.""
Mr Trump was charged last week with 18 alleged co-conspirators with attempting to overturn his 2020 election defeat in the state of Georgia.
At least 11 of the co-conspirators - Mr Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Kenneth Chesebro, Cathy Latham, Harrison Floyd, Mark Meadows, Ray Smith, Harrison Floyd and Scott Hall - have so far been booked and processed at the local jail in Atlanta.
While the former president and his supporters are clearly pleased with his mugshot, photos of his indicted allies have been less well received.
""I thought these were all memes at first,"" said Jake Olson, a photographer based in Columbus, Ohio. ""It's the perfect storm of bad photos, There are so many cardinal rules of photography that they are just not following.""
""They have this one interrogation-style light, you can see they all have that little highlight on their foreheads,"" said Pittsburgh photographer and professor Ray Mantle. ""They all don't look great… they all look tired.""
The expressions vary widely. Lawyer Jenna Ellis is beaming down the lens, while Ray Smith, also an attorney, glares into the camera - two strikingly different choices for a photo that, unlike most other mugshots, will be published far and wide.
""For a lot of these people, this is their major public debut,"" Mr Mantle said. ""They know that everyone's going to see these.""
Pulling off a good mugshot can be tough, said Cooper Lawrence, a journalist who has written extensively about celebrity culture. It's a difficult balance to strike, a challenge that celebrities like Justin Bieber, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton have all had to face.
""Don't smile. A smile will make it look too arrogant,"" Lawrence said. ""You want to smirk like Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton do. A smirk says, 'yes, this sucks, but I'm gonna be fine.'""
Hair, makeup and wardrobe - even while in the custody of Fulton County authorities - is crucial, she said. But ""keep it simple"", she added. ""You're going to jail, not on an audition.""

Mr Trump, however, is a man well aware of the power of his public image. 
Earlier this year he complained that producers on Fox News chose to ""purposely show the absolutely worst pictures of me, especially the big 'orange' one with my chin pulled way back"". 
And to some the low quality of the Fulton County mugshot looks especially strange on a former president, even with its possible promotional value. 
""It struck me how humbling and humanising a bad portrait can be,"" said Mr Olson. ""It's funny to see such a poorly done portrait of somebody who has such a significant presence, to say the least.""
But despite the low resolution, Edd Mair, a lecturer in the History of Modern America at the University of York, said Mr Trump's campaign ""clearly thinks there's a lot to get out of a photo like this"". 
""What's most striking about it is how on brand this is for Donald Trump. Even a mugshot there's a way of converting this into political capital and enthusing his base.""
Some right-wing commentators have been drawing analogies with Nelson Mandela and Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who had mugshots taken, including in an iconic 1963 shot from Birmingham Jail.
""They did the same thing to Martin Luther King Jr,"" tweeted comedian and Trump supporter Terrence K Williams.
""They go after the good guys and especially the ones who fight for freedom and expose evilness and corruption. I stand with President Trump and this mugshot makes me want to vote for him even more.""
Mr Mair said Trump supporters will be attempting to frame the mugshot in this way. ""These people were deemed as dangerous individuals going against the grain, but they were eventually proven right. This is what Donald Trump and his supporters want to get out of this mugshot.""
But those on the left and the centre will see the photo very differently, he said. 
""Certainly it will be used in the same breath as Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal too, but even Nixon never got this far in actually having a mugshot. 
""I think on the left and in the centre ground this will be seen as quite a low moment for the American presidency.""

What now for Wagner after Prigozhin's death?,"This video can not be played
Watch: Prigozhin, from hot dog seller to mercenary group leader
Yevgeny Prigozhin spent almost a decade building the Wagner paramilitary group.
It became central to Russia's war effort in Ukraine and Prigozhin's troops helped to spread Russian influence across the globe, propping up allies of President Vladimir Putin in Africa and Syria. 
Now his death has sparked a flurry of speculation about the group's future. 
Western security officials are wondering who will take his place and what will happen to the mercenaries he once led. 
Dr Joana de Deus Pereira, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told the BBC's World Tonight programme that Prigozhin's death would likely lead to ""a certain revamping"" of the group. 
But she said that overall Wagner's operations would probably continue in much the same way as it had under Prigozhin's leadership. 
""The organisation will persist in the future probably with another name, but it has already proved it has the capacity to adapt and to morph,"" she said. 
""We have to look at Wagner not only as a single man but as an ecosystem, as a hydra with many many heads and many diverse interests in Africa."" 
Ruslan Trad, a security analyst with the Atlantic Council, agreed. He told the BBC that Prigozhin's death would likely see someone with connections to Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, installed to lead the group in his place.
But he suggested that the main challenge for Mr Putin may be finding someone with deep enough pockets to fund the paramilitary's operations, while not posing a direct challenge to his regime. 
""They will try to find a new financier because Prigozhin was the main person with money there,"" Mr Trad said. 
""I think it will be more difficult to find a new financier because [Wagner] have good commanders, but money is important here. Maybe they will [install] someone from the close circle around Putin."" 
Benoît Bringer, a journalist whose documentary The Rise of Wagner charted the paramilitary's rise, told the BBC that one of the leading contenders is GRU General Andrey Averyanov. 
""It is likely that Putin needed time to secretly organise the transition. This would explain why he waited two months before getting rid of Prigozhin,"" he added. 
Emily Ferris of Rusi observed that Moscow ""will have likely learned its lesson that personalities like Prigozhin with their own dangerous ambitions are a wildcard,"" adding that ""any new [Wagner] leader would likely be someone handpicked by the Kremlin"". 
For much of the past year Wagner was Russia's most effective fighting force in Ukraine, with its troops successfully taking the eastern cities of Soledar and Bakhmut after bloody battles. 
But Ms Ferris said Prigozhin's death was unlikely to seriously impact the course of the war. 
""Wagner troops have been out of action in Ukraine since the rebellion, and their troops stationed either in Belarus, or absorbed back in to the Ministry of Defence, so the impact immediately on the Ukraine war, where the Russian forces are still holding back the Ukrainian counter-offensive, is likely to be minimal for now,"" she observed. 
She added that it appeared unlikely that Wagner troops would return to the battlefield in Ukraine, at least in the short term. 
Thousands of Wagner fighters followed Prigozhin to Russia's western neighbour, Belarus, following an aborted armed revolt against Russia's top military brass in June. 
On Friday, Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko said up to 10,000 Wagner fighters would ""in the next few days"" be in the group's main camp in Osipovichi, south-east of Minsk.
""Wagner lived, Wagner is alive, and Wagner will live in Belarus, no matter if someone would not like it,"" he was quoted as saying by Belarus' state-run Belta news agency.
He was speaking shortly after satellite images analysed by BBC Verify had shown that several of the tents at the camp were being dismantled.
The photos were taken by the US-based Planet Labs company. It is not clear exactly when the work began and whether occupants of the tents are housed elsewhere in Belarus or have left the country.
The US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty media group reported on Thursday that as many as 101 of 273 tents in the camp had already been taken down.
Addressing the issue, Mr Lukashenko said only ""extra tents"" were being removed as there was no need to have so many of them.
Still, the future of Wagner fighters is unclear, as many Belarusian, Russian and Western experts argue that Mr Lukashenko is de facto President Putin's puppet, obeying his orders.
At the same time, some reports on social media suggest that several Wagner fighters have already made explicit threats against Mr Putin for what they allege is his role in Prigozhin's death. 
Equally unclear is the future of Wagner's troops abroad. The group has become a key pillar of Russian foreign policy, with its forces helping to prop up governments in Syria, Mali, the Central African Republic and Libya in exchange for lucrative mining rights.
In recent days Prigozhin is believed to have been present in West Africa, where Western analysts fear the group was seeking to widen its reach into other countries, including Niger where a coup has just taken place.
Some had speculated that the decapitation of the group's leadership could force Russia to re-evaluate its attempts to seek influence in the region, but many experts believe the group's decentralised command on the continent should allow it to continue its operations unhindered by Prigozhin's death.
Following June's mutiny, Russian officials were reported to have flown to Libya to meet Khalifa Haftar, the renegade general challenging the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, and assured him of the Wagner Group's continued support, regardless of Prigozhin's fate. 
Mr Trad told the BBC that he believed Wagner was so heavily integrated in the defence infrastructure of African countries that their operations would be untroubled by Prigozhin's death. 
""The commanders stationed in Syria, or Central African Republic or Mali, they already have very good models in place there and they have the freedom to act,"" he said. 
""Local commanders are not impacted because the operations are separately operational, they have different resources for this and even now they are recruiting for Syria and Africa operations."" 
And he said the group's arms length relationship with Russian intelligence would remain a valuable tool for Moscow, allowing it to operate in the ""grey zone"" where it could pursue Russia's interests, but allowing officials to deny involvement. 
Mr Bringer told the BBC that Wagner was ""essential in Africa"" in terms of promoting Russian interests. ""The structure will certainly continue to exist there, perhaps no longer under the name of Wagner, but with a new head loyal to the Kremlin,"" he said. 
Anton Mardasov, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute's Syria Program, said even in the wake of Prigozhin's failed uprising in Russia, Wagner commanders abroad largely escaped Kremlin reprisals to avoid ""weakening Moscow's overall position"". 
But he said other mercenary companies were increasingly rivalling Wagner's role in Syria. After June's mutiny Mr Mardasov said that a number of Wagner troops had been offered a transfer to a competing company called PMC Redut. 
""Redut has been working in Syria in parallel with Wagner for a long time,"" Mr Mardasov told the BBC. ""It is on the Redut that the military is betting in Syria, but they were afraid of fast steps."" 
In the medium-term, therefore, it seems unlikely that Wagner's operations will be significantly impacted by its benefactor's death. But in the longer term Wagner's operations look set to reform into something new, Emily Ferris of Rusi said. 
""Most likely is that Wagner will splinter into two, with the remaining leaderless groupings in Belarus disbanded, and the other faction active abroad morphing into something else that can be a tool of Russian foreign policy,"" she told the BBC. 
As for Prigozhin's legacy, Mr Bringer told the BBC that Wagner had ""demonstrated to the Kremlin how a private shadowy army, capable of operating totally out of the law, could be useful in its hybrid wars, as well as to gain influence abroad."" 
""The name of Wagner may disappear, but not the mercenaries in the field and the method he created.""

St Kitts and Nevis country profile,"The former British colony of St Kitts and Nevis is inhabited mostly by the descendants of West African slaves.
Its beaches, scenery and a warm, sunny climate are a great tourist attraction. It is also vulnerable to hurricanes.
The islands of St Kitts - also known as St Christopher - and Nevis have been in an uneasy federation since independence from Britain in 1983, with some politicians in Nevis saying the federal government in St Kitts - home to a majority of the population - had ignored the needs of Nevisians.
But a referendum on secession held in Nevis in 1998 failed to gain the two-thirds majority needed to break away.
Under the constitution, Nevis has considerable autonomy and has an island assembly, a premier, and a deputy governor-general.
Tourism, offshore finance and service industries are important sources of income - more so since a centuries-old but loss-making sugar industry was wound down in 2005 with the loss of hundreds of jobs. 
Head of state: King Charles III, represented by a governor-general 
Prime Minister: Terrance Drew
Terrance Drew was elected as prime minister after his St Kitts-Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP) won the August 2022 general election.
Mr Drew is the fifth prime minister since the country gained independence from Britain in 1983.
The government operates national television and radio networks. There are several private radio stations.
Freedom of expression is generally respected by the government, says Freedom House.

How big are Donald Trump's legal problems?,"Donald Trump has been criminally indicted four times, and will have a series of trials to attend in 2024 as he runs again for the White House.
Here's a guide to the four cases and what they could mean for the former president and current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination.
What are the charges in Georgia 2020 election investigation?
This is the most recent indictment, the one that saw the first ever mugshot of a former US president after Donald Trump turned himself in at the Fulton County Jail on Thursday. The charges for Mr Trump - listed now as inmate no. P01135809 on Fulton County Jail records - were unsealed on Monday night.
Mr Trump and 18 others are named in a 41-count indictment for alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state.
The investigation was sparked in part by a leaked phone call in which the former president asked Georgia's top election official to ""find 11,780 votes"".
Mr Trump was hit with 13 criminal counts including an alleged violation of Georgia's Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico).
His other charges include solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiring to commit impersonating a public officer, conspiring to commit forgery, conspiring to commit false statements, and writing and conspiring to file false documents.
What are the potential penalties?
The racketeering charge, which is mostly used in organised crime cases, carries a maximum 20-year jail sentence.
Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis would need to prove that there was a pattern of corruption from Mr Trump and his allies aimed at overturning the election result in order to bring a conviction.
As for making false statements, that carries a penalty of between one to five years in prison or a fine. 
And a person convicted of first-degree criminal solicitation to commit election fraud will face between one to three years in jail.
What will his defence be?
Mr Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in the case.
He has defended the phone call in question as ""perfect"" and accused Ms Willis of launching a politically motivated inquiry.
What are the charges in 2020 election investigation? 
Donald Trump has been criminally charged in a separate federal investigation into efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election.
The 45-page indictment contains four counts: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.
They stem from the former president's actions in the wake of the 2020 election, including around the 6 January Capitol riot, which occurred while Congress was meeting to certify Joe Biden's victory.

What are the potential penalties?
Penalties for these charges include: 
But there are logistical, security and political questions around whether Mr Trump would serve time even if charged and convicted.
What will his defence be? 
Mr Trump was formally charged in court in Washington DC on 3 August. A tentative trial date is expected to be set on 28 August.
He argues that the charges are an attempt to prevent him from winning the 2024 presidential election. Before leaving Washington after his arraignment hearing, he told journalists the case ""is a persecution of a political opponent"".
Mr Trump has repeatedly denied responsibility for the riot on 6 January 2021. 
His legal team is also likely to argue that the former president is not directly responsible for the violence that unfolded that day because he told supporters to march ""peacefully"" on the Capitol and is protected by First Amendment free speech rights.
What are the charges in classified documents case?
Mr Trump is facing 40 criminal charges over his alleged mishandling of classified material after he left the White House. 
Thousands of documents were seized in an FBI search at his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago last year, including about 100 that were marked as classified.
The charges are related to both his handling of the documents and his alleged efforts to obstruct the FBI's attempts to retrieve them.
The majority of the counts, are for the wilful retention of national defence information, which falls under the Espionage Act.
There are then eight individual counts which include conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record and making false statements.
Will Donald Trump go to jail?
These charges could - in theory - lead to substantial prison time if Mr Trump is convicted.
But the logistics, security and politics of jailing a former president mean a conventional prison sentence is seen as unlikely by many experts.
Looking at the letter of the law, the counts under the Espionage Act, for example, each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years.
Other counts, related to conspiracy and withholding or concealing documents, each carry maximum sentences of 20 years.
Counts relating to a scheme to conceal, and false statements and representations carry sentences of five years each.
But while there is no doubt the charges are serious, many questions remain unanswered about the potential penalties should he be convicted.
What will his defence be?
Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and the trial is set to begin in May 2024.
The former president has offered shifting defences for the material found at his property, mostly arguing that he declassified it. No evidence has been provided that this was possible or is true.

Trump supporters outside court: 'They're afraid of him'
His lawyers may argue in court that Mr Trump was unfairly targeted and that other politicians, namely Hillary Clinton, Mike Pence and current President Joe Biden, were never charged for their handling of classified documents.
But experts say the former president's case is different in a number of ways. For one, other politicians were willing to return whatever documents they had, while prosecutors allege Mr Trump resisted.
What are the charges in New York hush money case?
Mr Trump is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.
The charges stem from a hush-money payment made before the 2016 election to the adult film star Stormy Daniels, who says she had an adulterous affair with Mr Trump.
While such a payment is not illegal, spending money to help a presidential campaign but not disclosing it violates federal campaign finance law.
What are the potential penalties?
Each of the charges carries a maximum of four years in prison, although a judge could sentence Mr Trump to probation if he is convicted.
Legal experts have told BBC News they think it is unlikely Mr Trump will be jailed if convicted in this case and a fine is the more likely outcome.
What will his defence be? 
Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty and is due to stand trial in the case in March.
He denies ever having sexual relations with Ms Daniels and says the payment was made to protect his family from false allegations, not to sway the election.

Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia,"Ukraine's counter-offensive is continuing its slow progress, but developments in the country were overshadowed by reports that the man who led the recent mutiny against Russia's military leadership had been killed in a plane crash in Russia.
Here are the latest developments:
Ukraine has continued counter-offensive operations, and made further gains in and around Robotyne in south-eastern Zaporizhzhia and to the west of the nearby village of Verbove.
Analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) say the advances are ""tactically significant"" and are ""widening the Ukrainian breach of Russian defensive lines in the area and threatening Russian secondary lines of defence"".
The ISW says Ukraine's advance through Robotyne and its potential liberation will stop Russia using it as a base for counterattacks, making it easier for Ukrainian forces to launch offensive operations against the Russian secondary line of defence that runs south of Robotyne to the western outskirts of Verbove.
A successful advance through Russian defensive lines is likely to need a widening of the initial breach to stop Russian forces from cutting off Ukraine's attacking force, the analysts add.
Ukraine's forces are now believed to be within about 1.25 miles (2km) of Russia's secondary lines of defences - mainly comprising anti-tank ditches and obstacles known as dragon's teeth - and may be less heavily mined than some other areas.
Ukrainian forces have also continued operations around what is left of the city of Bakhmut - which has endured some of the heaviest fighting of the war and has been under Russian control for several months.
However, both sides claim to have repelled attacks against their forces and it appears that neither side has advanced significantly.
Russia has continued its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, with an attack on 19 August killing at least seven people including a six-year-old girl.
Fifteen children were also among almost 150 people injured after a missile hit a theatre in the northern city of Chernihiv, which is about 30 miles (50km) south of Ukraine's border with Belarus.
Although it was besieged by Russian troops in the first few months of the invasion, it was liberated by Ukraine more than a year ago and is hundreds of miles from the front line.
The theatre had been hosting a gathering of drone manufacturers, Chernihiv's acting mayor Oleksandr Lomako told the BBC.
He accepted Russia's target was a ""military event"" but added: ""It is clear that the Russians launching those missiles and those giving them orders in the middle of the day to the civilian city realised that the victims will be primarily civilians.
""There is no other way to interpret it than a war crime against civilians, yet another Russian war crime.""
The theatre's roof was badly damaged but none of those hurt were in the theatre when the missile hit.
Meanwhile, three people were killed by a suspected drone attack in the border region of Belgorod in Russia and a skyscraper in Moscow was damaged in another suspected drone attack on 23 August.
A suspected drone attack also left one of Russia's flagship Tupolev Tu-22 bombers ablaze at an airbase south of St Petersburg this week.
According to Russian media reports monitored by BBC Verify, there have been more than 160 suspected aerial drone attacks this year in Russia and in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.
There have also been about a dozen sea drone attacks on Russian targets in the Black Sea, including on naval bases and the Crimean bridge.
Although Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility for specific drone strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"".
However, President Zelensky has denied that Kyiv had anything to do with the plane crash in which Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin is presumed to have died along with nine others.
The crash between Moscow and St Petersburg on Wednesday overshadowed most other developments in the war and came less than three months after Prigozhin led an armed mutiny, sending Wagner forces marching on Moscow.
The mutiny ended after Russia's President Vladimir Putin said Wagner fighters could either join the regular Russian army or go to Belarus with Prigozhin as part of a deal negotiated by Belarus's leader Alexander Lukashenko.
Mr Putin sent condolences and paid tribute to Prigozhin on Thursday, but stopped short of definitively confirming he was dead, and the Kremlin has said allegations that it gave an order to kill Prigozhin were ""a complete lie.""
Although Wagner was Russia's most effective fighting force in Ukraine, with its troops successfully taking the eastern cities of Soledar and Bakhmut after bloody battles, many analysts do not believe Prigozhin's death will have much impact on the war.
Emily Ferris, from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) defence think tank, says most Wagner troops have been out of action since the mutiny, with most either in Belarus or having joined the Russian army, and it is unlikely many will return to the battlefield at least in the short term.
Russia's invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.
Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.
Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.
But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.
Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.
By October the picture had changed dramatically and having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north.
More than a year since the invasion, Ukraine is now hoping its latest counter-offensive can turn the war in its favour.

To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project. To show key areas where advances are taking place we are also using updates from the UK Ministry of Defence and BBC research.
The situation in Ukraine is often fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps.

"Fukushima: Discharge from Japan nuclear plant safe, tests show","The operator of the Fukushima nuclear plant says seawater samples taken around the facility are safe. 
Tepco's test results come a day after the release of treated contaminated water from the plant in Japan, which was destroyed in a tsunami in 2011.
The discharge into the Pacific Ocean has sparked protests in the region and retaliation from Beijing.
Japan told its citizens living in China to keep a low profile on Friday, including talking quietly in public.
""When going out, try to be cautious, such as not speaking Japanese loudly unnecessarily,"" the country's embassy in Beijing said. It also warned citizens to ""pay close attention to the surroundings of the embassy"" if planning to visit.
Japan's consulate in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong also issued a notice warning of protests there relating to the water release, after 100 people took to the streets on Thursday objecting to the discharge.
Chinese officials have called Japan's decision to release the water ""extremely selfish and irresponsible"", despite the UN's nuclear watchdog approving the plan. 
Beijing, the biggest buyer of seafood from Japan, imposed a ban on all such imports after the discharge of water began. 
It has also seen panic buying of sea salt amid fears that future supplies could be contaminated.
China's biggest salt producer, the state-run National Salt Industry Group, said it was ramping up supplies as people in some parts of the country had rushed to stock up following the water release.
But Tepco said seawater samples taken on Thursday afternoon showed radioactivity levels were well within safe limits. 
""We confirmed that the analysed value is equal to the calculated concentration and that the analysed value is below 1,500 Bq/L,"" Tepco spokesman Keisuke Matsuo told a news conference.
Becquerels per litre - or Bq/L - is a measure of radioactivity. The national safety standard is 60,000.
The results were ""similar to our previous simulation and sufficiently below"" the safety limit, Mr Matsuo added.
He said Tepco would continue to conduct analysis every day for the next month and ""even after that, maintain our analysis effort"".
Japan's environment ministry said it had also collected seawater samples from 11 different locations on Friday and would release the results on Sunday.
More than a million tonnes of water stored at Fukushima will be discharged over the next 30 years.
Since 2011, Tepco has been pumping in water to cool the remains of three reactors. The resulting contaminated water is treated and stored in more than 1,000 massive tanks.
The plant operator says the water has been filtered of all radioactive elements except for tritium and is safe.
On Thursday the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said samples taken from the first batch of diluted water prepared for discharge showed tritium levels were well within safe limits.
Most scientists agree but environmental pressure group Greenpeace has said the filtration process, known as ALPS, does not work and that a vast amount of radioactivity will be released into the ocean.

Africa and Wagner: What happens now Prigozhin is presumed dead?,"This video can not be played
The presumed death of Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin will test the resilience of operations by thousands of mercenaries active in Africa's Sahel region.
Wagner has a decentralised command on the continent where it provides security for some African leaders in exchange for mineral and other strategic economic and military concessions.
But given Prigozhin's death, how does this affect Wagner going forward? And does this impact Russia and Africa's relationship?
The BBC's Beverly Ochieng explains.

St Vincent and the Grenadines country profile,"The multi-island country of St Vincent and the Grenadines is home to La Soufriere, an active volcano which last erupted in 1979. 
Of the many islands and cays that make up the Grenadines, Mustique, Palm Island and Union Island are haunts of the rich and famous - offering yachting, diving and fine beaches.
Efforts are being made to diversify the economy away from bananas. A new international airport, Argyle International Airport, was opened in 2017 to help boost the tourism sector.
Head of state: King Charles III, represented by a governor
Prime minister: Ralph Gonsalves
Ralph Gonsalves has been the prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines since 2001.  A former university lecturer and lawyer, he leads the Unity Labour Party (ULP). 
In November 2020, he made history by securing the fifth consecutive victory of his Unity Labour Party in a general election.
In April 2021, the La Soufrière volcano erupted, sending ash several miles into the atmosphere. Approximately 22,400 people were evacuated from areas close to the volcano. The eruption damaged critical services, infrastructure, and agriculture, and affected the entire population of the island of St Vincent.
The World Bank provided $20m to address immediate needs in the same month and then allocated a further $50m for budget support in June 2021.
In November 2021 it approved a further $40m for the Volcanic Eruption Emergency Project in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
There are several private radio stations and a national radio service which is partly government-funded.
Some key dates in the history of St Vincent and the Grenadines:
1300 - Carib Indians of South America conquer the indigenous Arawak Indians.
1498 - Christopher Columbus visits the main island on St Vincent's Day.
1783 - Treaty of Versailles recognises St Vincent as a British colony.
1795-97 - Britain, with French support, deports 5,000 Caribs to Belize following an uprising.
1834 - Slavery abolished, forcing plantation owners to free more than 18,000 slaves; foreign labourers indentured.
1958-62 - St Vincent is a member of the British-sponsored West Indies Federation.
1979 - Independence. A revolt on Union Island by a group that wanted more power in the country's new government is put down.
2003 - The country is removed from a list of nations deemed uncooperative in the fight against money-laundering.
2009 - Voters reject the proposal to replace the monarchy with a republic in a constitutional referendum. 
2021- La Soufriere volcano erupts, some 22,400 people are evacuated

Irish students receive boosted Leaving Cert results for third year running,"Elanas Zemaitis, a pupil at Donahies Community School, Dublin, celebrates after receiving his results
At a glance
Students in the Republic of Ireland got their results at 10:00
The grades this year have been boosted by 7.9% to continue to minimise the effects of disruption from the Covid-19 pandemic 
Adjustments have been ongoing for three years now
But this year's boost was higher than 2022's
Tens of thousands of students in the Republic of Ireland have received their Leaving Certificate results.
The qualification is similar to A Levels in the UK.
But unlike in the UK, measures for minimising Covid-19 disruption to students have continued this year.
Marks were artificially boosted by nearly 8%.
That's due to a commitment made by the education minister that grades would be no lower than last years results to ""ensure fairness and equity for students"" that were faced with disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The same commitment was made last year, but grades then were only hiked by 5.6%. This year's marks have been awarded a significantly higher hike, at an average of 7.9%.
For pupils leaving school in Ireland this year, these were the first state exams they had ever sat. They did not sit Junior Certificate exams (roughly equivalent to GCSEs) because of the pandemic.
71% of all grades awarded this year have risen as a result of the hike, compared to 50% last year.
Ecuation Minister Norma Foley said: “I would like to extend the heartiest of congratulations to each and every one of the over 60,000 students across Ireland receiving their results today. 
""Today brings enormous reward and recognition for all your hard work and dedication over the past number of years, including through challenging times.""
Pupils Sophie Brohoon, Rebecca Kavanagh and Nimh Woods were among those receiving Leaving Cert results in Ireland on Friday
For students from Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom that are keen to get into an Irish university, they don't have the aid of an inflated grade system.
A-level grades for 2023 were not inflated in any way. 
In 2020 and 2021 A-level students received calculated grades from their schools.
But for the Leaving Certificate students of 2023, none of them sat their Junior cycle exams, so the exams were the first state tests those students had ever sat.
An official for the State Examinations Commission told journalists at a briefing the situation is ""tricky - there are different impacts for different groups"".
There are options for students to calculate their results to know about their next steps, often students can find a leaving cert calculator online but there can be a wait time on the official Irish careers portal calculator., external
To pass, you need to have at least 28 points. 
The average Leaving Certificate points received by students in Ireland in 2022 was between 400 - 419 points.
Leaving Certificate exams have eight grades. 
Grade 1 is the highest grade, 8 is the lowest. 
Marks between 100% and 30% are divided into seven equal bands (Grade 1-7).
Any marks less than 30% are counted as Grade 8. 
Those grades are equivalent to points which is how a student will find out whether they have got places in university or higher education.

Heineken sells off Russian beer business for €1,"Heineken has finally sold off its Russian business for €1 - or 86p - nearly a year and a half after first pledging to do so.
The Dutch brewer said it will take a loss of €300m on the division, which is being offloaded to Russia's Arnest, which makes aerosol cans.
Many Western firms jettisoned their Russian operations when the country invaded Ukraine last February.  
Heineken's Dolf van den Brink said: ""It took much longer than we had hoped.""
The chief executive and chairman added: ""[But] this transaction secures the livelihoods of our employees and allows us to exit the country in a responsible manner.""
For €1, Arnest will buy seven breweries and take on 1,800 workers with guarantees to employ them for the next three years.
The manufacture of the Amstel beer brand will be phased out over six months, joining Heineken lager which the company said was removed in 2022. 
""Recent developments demonstrate the significant challenges faced by large manufacturing companies in exiting Russia,"" Mr van den Brink said.
Last month, President Vladimir Putin seized Russian assets owned by Carlsberg and French yoghurt-maker Danone.
Earlier this week, the franchise owner of Domino's Pizza signalled it would shut its Russian shops and put the business into bankruptcy.
DP Eurasia said it would no longer try to sell the operation because of an ""increasingly challenging environment"".
Russia has been targeted by a number of economic sanctions since its tanks rolled into Ukraine on 24 February 2022.
Many household names decided to close their operations in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. Others, such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola, faced pressure to exit Russia. 
There has also been ongoing criticism for the ones that have continued business.
Yale University's School of Management has been tracking which firms have exited and which have stayed. Those that remain include the likes of UK telecoms firm BT Group, and Lacoste, the upmarket French sportswear brand.

Nottingham: 'Dangerous' man stabbed housemate with bread knife,"A man who stabbed his housemate in the side of the head and neck while shouting ""I will kill you"" has been jailed. 
Yehya Mahdi told police he drank 12 cans of beer and armed himself with a bread knife before the attack.
They were both asylum seekers, and the attack happened at their Home Office-approved mid-terrace house in Sneinton Boulevard, Nottingham, on 14 January.
Mahdi was sentenced to two years and eight months at Nottingham Crown Court.
The attacker, who is from Sudan, told his housemate he did not like him as he was from Libya - a country he blamed for his brother's death.
Nottinghamshire Police said that the victim could hear Mahdi breaking things in the house and swearing shortly before the attack.
He stayed in his room until Mahdi banged on his door pretending to be the police.
After the attack, the victim managed to push Mahdi away and escape, the force said.
When officers were called to the scene, the victim was found bleeding outside the property.
He was taken to hospital and put in intensive care where he made a good recovery and was discharged after five days.
Mahdi pleaded guilty to committing grievous bodily harm and was jailed on Monday.
Det Con Rory Greer described Mahdi as a ""dangerous individual"".
""This was a horrific attack and it was only by pure luck that the victim was not more seriously hurt,"" he said.
""Having escaped a war in Libya, the victim had come to the UK as an asylum seeker in order to try and create a better life for himself.
""By coming here, he believed he would be much safer - but this proved not to be the case because of the actions of one violent man.""

Cork Ironman triathletes offered counselling after deaths during race,"Brendan Wall (l) and Ivan Chittenden (r) died in separate events during the Ironman event in Youghal, County Cork
At a glance
Mental health support is offered to all participants in a race in which two people died
The Cork Ironman race took place last weekend
Ivan Chittenden and Brendan Wall got into difficulty during the swimming element of the event
Organisers said it was an ""unprecedented and challenging time"" and called the deaths ""a devastating loss""
All triathletes who took part in an Ironman race in the Republic of Ireland in which two swimmers died have been offered counselling.
In spite of the two fatalities, the Cork Ironman event on Sunday continued and one participant later talked about the shock of seeing the body of one of the men who died.
Hundreds of triathletes took part in the event, including 11 from the Lisburn Triathlon Club in Northern Ireland.
Triathlon Ireland, the governing body of events on the island, has said it is doing what it can to support anyone affected by the tragedy, including family members who watched the race.
Both men got into difficulty in the swim element of the half Ironman triathlon event at Claycastle beach
In a message posted to its 20,000 members on its website, it said: ""It’s been a very challenging and unprecedented time for the Triathlon community as we all come to terms with the devastating loss of two people from our community.
""Our top priority is the welfare of our Triathlon Ireland (TI) members, especially those who may have been affected by the events of Sunday 20 August 2023. 
""Following valuable feedback from you all, we have put in place a professional and confidential counselling service for any TI members affected by Sunday’s events.
""This service, fully funded by Triathlon Ireland, is available to TI members who participated in last Sunday’s race and their family members who were present on that day.""
A vigil was held on Thursday night in Youghal in County Cork to remember the two men who died, Ivan Chittenden from Canada and Brendan Wall from County Meath.

Virgin Galactic: Student Ana Mayers on going to space with her mum,"This video can not be played
Ana says she is still starstruck after experiencing zero-gravity in space
""Being in space and seeing the Earth with your own eyes is such a peaceful and loving experience.""
Two weeks ago, 18-year-old Ana Mayers was experiencing zero gravity in space. Oh and she went with her mum.
The pair, along with former Olympian Jon Goodwin, were on Virgin Galactic's first tourist flight - making them the first mother-daughter duo to fly to space together.
Fast forward a fortnight and Ana is heading to the University of Aberdeen to continue her philosophy and physics degree.
BBC Newsbeat caught up with the student before she flew from Antigua in the Caribbean, where she lives, back to Scotland earlier.
""The whole experience was just so connecting and emotional,"" she says.
""It's just an unbelievably beautiful view, it's incredible.
""It's made me a lot more aware of the fact that we need to appreciate Earth and use this opportunity to really explore and find a connection with nature.""
Ana and her mum Keisha Schahaff, 46, got their place on the trip-of-a-lifetime after winning a competition.
And Ana says she was actually asleep in her uni halls when she got the news.
""My mum FaceTimed me at a really random time that night and it was just my face on the screen, you couldn't see anything else,"" she says. 
""Richard Branson took the phone, I was flabbergasted.""
The pair, along with 80-year-old Jon, took off from Spaceport America in New Mexico on 10 August.
The flight lasted about 90 minutes and they experienced zero gravity at an altitude of around 85km (280,000ft) where they got a very special view of the planet.
Unsurprisingly there was a lot of training to prepare the space tourists for their trip, but Ana says she had ""no nerves"" when it was finally time for take-off.
""It feels like you're on like just a normal commercial flight, it was very peaceful,"" she says. 
""But I do remember when they started counting down like saying three minutes to release, one minute to release, I was like 'oh my God, this is really happening'.
""I was just so filled with excitement.""
Ana says she doesn't feel like she's ""been so engaged with anything in my life"" as the trip to space.
And now she's returned to Earth, lots of people have started to look to her as an inspiration.
""I'm so honoured to be able to inspire so many people,"" she says.
""I definitely hope that it's opening people's minds up, not only just for space but for other things in life.
""I hope it's inspiring them to really take themselves seriously and to put in the work and the effort.
""You really do have to be open and ready for opportunities to find you.""

Fukushima: The fishy business of China's outrage over Japan's release,"Japan has called on China to remove a total ban on its seafood products, imposed after Tokyo began the scientifically-endorsed release of treated water from its Fukushima nuclear plant.
China, the leading buyer of Japan's fish, announced on Thursday it was making the order due to concerns for consumers' health.
However, the claim is not backed by science - with the consensus from experts being that the release poses no safety risks to ocean life or seafood consumption.
""The main reason is not really the safety concerns,"" international trade law expert Henry Gao told the BBC. ""It is mainly due to Japan's moves against China,"" he said, noting Japan's closer alignment to the US and South Korea in recent years.
Following the waters' release on Thursday, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors at the site said their tests showed the discharge had even lower radiation levels than the limits Japan has set - 1,500 becquerels/litre - which is about seven times lower than the global drinking water standard.
And despite Japanese fishermen's fears, analysts say the trade hit to Japan's industry will be short-lived and less than expected.
The main market for Japan's fish remains its domestic one. 
Locals consume most of the catch, so top seafood companies Nissui and Maruha Nichiro have both said they expect limited impact from China's ban. Both companies' stock prices were slightly up at close of trade on the day of the ban's announcement, Reuters reported. 
Beyond China, no other country has even hinted at a total ban - South Korea still bans seafood imports from Fukushima and some surrounding prefectures.
Experts say even people who scoff down lots of seafood will be exposed to only extremely low doses of radiation - in the range of 0.0062 to 0.032 microSv per year, said Mark Foreman, an associate professor of nuclear chemistry in Sweden. 
Humans can safely be exposed to tens of thousands of times more than that - or up to 1,000 microSv of radiation per year, Associate Prof Foreman said. 
Japan's government has admitted the local fishing industry will likely take a significant hit. 
It had previously criticised Beijing for spreading ""scientifically unfounded claims"", and on Thursday evening, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida again beseeched Beijing to look at the research.
""We have requested the withdrawal (of China's ban) through diplomatic channels,"" Mr Kishida told reporters on Thursday night. ""We strongly encourage discussion among experts based on scientific grounds.""
China and its territories Hong Kong and Macau - had already instated a partial ban on seafood from some Japanese areas -  but authorities now expanded that net.
Mainland China and Hong Kong are Japan's biggest international seafood buyers respectively, buying about $1.1bn (£866m) or 41% of Japan's seafood exports. 
Local media reported that following China's ban, the head of a Japanese fisheries association called Japan's Industry Minister, urging him to lobby Beijing to retract the ban.
But industry watchers are calm, knowing the usual vagaries of supply and demand in global trade.
Prof Gao said he expects some short-term disruption but ""soon the exporters shall be able to shift to other markets so the long-term effect will be small."" 
And on the other side of the trade, restaurants in Chinese cities won't be lacking in seafood delicacies. Japan supplies just 4% of the seafood China buys from abroad - Beijing buys much more from India, Ecuador and Russia, according to Chinese customs data cited by Reuters.
China's ban on seafood will also barely scrape Japan's overall economy. 
Marine products make up less than 1% of Japan's global trade, which is driven by car and machinery exports. Analysts say the impact of a seafood ban is negligible. 
""The Fukushima water release is mostly of political and environmental significance,"" Stefan Angrick, an economist at Moody's Analytics, told Reuters.
""Economically, the ramifications of a potential ban on Japanese food shipments are minimal.""
Still, public perception around the industry's damage and safety persists, not just in China, but South Korea where there have been crowds protesting.
In the months leading up to the water's release, fishermen in South Korea reported a notable decline in the sale value of their catch - but prices remained stable the day after the release.
At home in Japan, polling also shows a divide. The government has made significant efforts to both reassure citizens and appease the industry. It has promised subsidies and an emergency buy-out if seafood sales dive.
On Friday, Osaka authorities proposed to serve Fukushima seafood at government buildings. Meanwhile, the company running the Fukushima plan, Tepco, said it would also provide compensation to local businesses if they suffered poor sales.
But locals are also hardy. Following China's announcement on Thursday, many Japanese on Twitter even celebrated the ban - wryly suggesting it could mean cheaper fish at home. 
""Good news amid inflation…. Even Hokkaido sea urchin will be super cheap,"" one user tweeted.

Donald Trump still rewriting laws of politics after Georgia arrest,"Donald Trump has been complaining recently about the pictures used of him on Fox News. 
""They purposely show the absolutely worst pictures of me, especially the big 'orange' one with my chin pulled way back,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.
The former president obviously prefers the mugshot taken in Atlanta's Fulton County jail, where he was booked on charges of plotting to overturn Georgia's 2020 election result on Thursday.
Within minutes of the picture being released, it appeared on Mr Trump's website along with a statement saying he had been arrested despite committing no crime. ""What has taken place is a travesty of justice,"" it said, along with a call for campaign contributions. 
Mugshots have destroyed other political careers. For him, it has already become a campaign symbol.
In fact, in a matter of hours his official campaign was selling T-shirts featuring the image. ""NEVER SURRENDER,"" they read. Mugs and stickers are also available.
It is yet another example of how Mr Trump continues to defy political gravity. 
We are no longer surprised when his poll ratings rise with each criminal indictment against him. The Georgia charges, after all, were the fourth in five months.
We can also see that the man who may have to spend the better part of next year in a courtroom, not on the campaign trail, is still the clear frontrunner to win the Republican party's presidential nomination for 2024.
He is rewriting the laws of politics right in front of our eyes.
Anyone who doubts Mr Trump's continuing grip on the party should watch one moment from Wednesday night's televised Republican debate. 
Mr Trump chose to skip the event because he is so far ahead of his rivals he believed he had nothing to gain from being there. Yet he still loomed over the stage. 
All eight candidates were asked to raise their hand if they would still support Mr Trump for president if he is found guilty in court. Six hands went up in the air - even if Florida Governor Ron DeSantis conspicuously waited to see what the others did before raising his. 
Three quarters of the people running against Mr Trump will not dare to say he should not be president if he has a criminal conviction.
""Someone's got to stop normalising this conduct, okay?"" arch Trump-critic Chris Christie said. ""Whether or not you believe that the criminal charges are right or wrong, the conduct is beneath the office of president of the United States."" He was then practically booed off the stage.
Arguably, Mr Christie has it wrong. The Republican Party is not normalising Mr Trump's conduct. It is celebrating his actions and rewarding him with more support and adulation each time his legal problems become more serious.
""They are not after me, they are after you - I'm just standing in the way,"" Mr Trump often says. His supporters love that. 
It is a phrase I've had repeated back to me around the country. Even though no one is quite sure what it actually means, it encapsulates the idea that he is more than another politician. He presents himself as a potential martyr for his support base.
Mr Trump has an almost unique talent for attracting attention. He is using this moment to suffocate his rivals and opponents by starving them of the oxygen of publicity. He has successfully merged his legal problems with his political campaign - and turned both into a reality TV show.
That is why he brings cameras with him when he is arrested. That is why he called into right-wing TV stations to describe what it was like being booked in a notorious Atlanta jail. And that is why he will use this mugshot as the ultimate accolade.

Praggnanandhaa: India chess prodigy's 'remarkable' impact on the sport,"Indian chess prodigy R Praggnanandhaa's World Cup run has ended without a trophy, but experts say that his stellar performances will have a monumental impact on the game in the country.
The Indian grandmaster had to settle for the runner's up title after his opponent, the world's top-ranked Magnus Carlsen defeated him in a round of tie-breakers on Thursday, after their previous two games ended in a draw.
But experts have highlighted the youngster's grit and exceptional skills throughout the tournament in Baku. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the youngster on X for his ""remarkable"" performance and for putting up a ""tough fight"". Experts have described his achievement as ""tectonic and seminal"".
The 18-year-old's journey in the tournament has been nothing short of exceptional. 
Praggnanandhaa, or Pragg as he's popularly known, defeated the world's second and third ranked players to make it to the World Cup final, a remarkable feat in itself as no other Indian has competed in the finals since chess legend Vishwanathan Anand won the title back in 2002.
He also made headlines for becoming the world's youngest player to play in the finals and the third-youngest person to qualify for the Candidates Tournament, putting him in the league of prodigies like Carlsen himself and Bobby Fischer.
The teenager's achievements have bolstered his reputation in the field. With younger players making a mark, it also signals a ""generational shift"" in the game itself and that shift ""is likely to heavily favour India,"" Devangshu Datta, a columnist and Fide-rated chess player wrote in The Times of India.
During this World Cup, four Indian players advanced to the quarterfinals, securing an impressive 50% of the available slots.
Currently, there are 21 Indian players who hold positions within the top 100 junior players in the world, all under 20 years of age; among them, four rank in the top 10 and seven in the top 20.
These youngsters ""will almost certainly dominate chess for a decade or more,"" says Datta.
And the theory is a plausible one, because thousands of young Indians are now playing chess - a trend that began in the 2000s after Anand's victories made headlines - and has since steadily picked up speed.
Smartphones and cheap internet access have made it easy for children to hone their skills through apps and online tournaments, while basic chess coaching is easily available as well.
This is significantly different from the way things stood even a couple of decades ago. 
""For Indians players who arrived on the scene even two decades after Anand, access to regular training under a GM (Grandmaster) was almost inconceivable,"" notes sports writer Susan Ninan in The Indian Express.
Though the chess landscape in the country has changed drastically since then, experts say that more needs to be done if India truly wants its players to make a mark on the international stage. 
Right now, the game lacks proper support structures, and parents still find themselves having to fund their children's dreams. 
""It's still a bunch of plucky parents who've quit jobs, put chess above school for their kids, taken mortgages on their homes, and are travelling to tournaments with their 8-15-year-olds hoping funds will outlast their dreams,"" Ninan writes.
Praggnanandhaa too had a similar story. 
The son of a bank manager father and homemaker mother, his parents too reportedly had to borrow money to fund his games, at least up until 2016, when he became the world's youngest International Master at 10 years of age. Help arrived soon after in the form of a sponsor. 
Both he and his sister - who actually inspired him to start playing the sport - are first generation chess players in their family and their mother still travels with Praggnanandhaa around the world, making her son's favourite Tamil dishes during tournaments.
Praggnanandhaa's meteoric rise to the top is an inspiration to many, and a credit to his hard work and talent, and perhaps, a bit of luck. 
""Prag may have lost,"" writes Datta. ""But India's winning run may just have begun"".

Chandrayaan-3: The moment India's lunar rover Pragyaan stepped out for Moonwalk,"This video can not be played
Watch India's Chandrayaan-3 rover ramp down from lander Vikram
India's space agency has released new footage that shows Chandrayaan-3's rover for the first time ever.
The video was taken just hours after the country made history by becoming the first to land near the south pole.
It shows Pragyaan (Sanskrit for wisdom) exiting the lander by sliding down a ramp and taking first steps on the lunar surface.
The Vikram lander - carrying the rover in its belly - had successfully touched down as planned on Wednesday evening.
With this, India joins an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.
On Thursday, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said the 26kg rover had ""ramped down"" from the lander and ""India took a walk on the Moon!"". 
Friday morning's video showed the rover as it stepped out into the sunshine and its lengthening shadow.
Pragyaan - which moves at a speed of 1cm per second - is now roaming around the rocks and craters, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis. With each step, it's also leaving on the Moon's surface the imprint of Isro's logo and emblem embossed on its six wheels.
The rover is carrying two scientific instruments which will try to find out what minerals are present on the lunar surface and study the chemical composition of the soil. 
Pragyaan will communicate only with the lander which will send the information to the orbiter from Chandrayaan-2 - which is still circling the Moon - to pass it on to the Earth for analysis.
The landing on Wednesday coincided with the start of a lunar day - a day on the Moon equals a little over four weeks on Earth and this means the lander and rover will have 14 days of sunlight to charge their batteries. 
Once night falls, they will discharge and stop working. It is not yet clear whether they will come back to life when the next lunar day starts.
The lander is also carrying several scientific instruments which will help find out what goes on the Moon's surface and above and below it.
Moon is thought to hold important minerals but one of the major goals of Chandrayaan-3 is to hunt for water - scientists say the huge craters in the south pole region which are permanently in shadow hold ice which could support human habitation on the Moon in future. 
It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations.

Watch: India's Chandrayaan-3 rover comes out of the lander,"This video can not be played
The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has released the first-ever video of its rover for lunar mission Chandrayaan-3. 
In the video, the rover is seen coming down the ramp of Chandrayaan-3's lander, Vikram, onto the surface of the Moon.
India made history on 23 August when Vikram successfully touched down near the south pole of the Moon.
The 26kg rover called Pragyaan (the Sanskrit word for wisdom) was carried to the lunar surface in the lander's belly. 
It will now roam around the rocks and craters of the Moon, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.

Rodney was found on the side of the road on the island Ko Samui in Thailand just hours away from death, according to his rescuer. 
Niall Harbison has made it his mission to save 10,000 street dogs a month and Rodney is just one who has gone viral on social media.  
The puppy has now found his new home in Church Village, Rhondda Cynon Taf, with Carys Hawkey and Cameron Clarke who followed his journey on Instagram.

Dogs: Thai rescue pup on brink of death finds Welsh home,"This video can not be played
Thailand street puppy on the brink of death finds a new home in Wales
When Rodney was found malnourished on the side of the road on a Thai island the puppy was just hours from death, his rescuer said. 
The week-old stray was rescued in Koh Samui by Niall Harbison, an Irishman who is on a mission to feed, sterilise and treat street dogs. 
He documents these rescue dogs on social media.
Rodney's new owners from south Wales followed his journey on Instagram and ""fell in love"".
Mr Harbison retired to Thailand but struggled with his mental health and addiction and said he ""wanted to do something meaningful"". 
He started by ""feeding a few dogs on the street"", but it quickly grew from there.
Mr Harbison, who has 588,000 followers on Instagram, is on a mission to save 10,000 dogs a month.
""I don't want to log into social media and see sad news, so I try and make the dogs little characters and make it a bit happier,"" he said.
One of those characters was Rodney, who was ""oozing"", ""raw"" and ""barely looked like a dog"" when he found him.
""He was within an hour of dying.""
After seven months of intensive care, Rodney recovered and Mr Harbison was inundated with adoption applications. 
After multiple interviews by the team at Mr Harbison's newly founded charity, Happy Doggo, Rodney's new home was found.
Carys Hawkey and Cameron Clarke, from Church Village, Rhondda Cynon Taf, watched Rodney's transformation on Instagram. 
""When I found Niall's account, I was just obsessed,"" said Ms Hawkey, a teacher.
While Ms Hawkey was ""desperate"" for a second dog to join their New Zealand huntaway Khabib, Mr Clarke took a little more persuasion.
However, as soon as he saw Rodney, Mr Clarke said he knew he was the dog for them. 
Ms Hawkey said the adoption process was ""important"" to ensure dogs are safely rehomed.
Once the couple knew for certain that they could become Rodney's owners, Mr Clarke booked a trip to Thailand.
It took Rodney two flights, 24 hours and a pet taxi from Paris to London before he reached his new home, more than 6,200 miles away from Thailand.
""It's like he's always been here,"" said Ms Hawkey. ""He doesn't realise how happy he makes me.""
However, she said the attention on social media was ""overwhelming"".
There are more than 20,000 followers of Rodney and Khabib's daily adventures on Instagram. 
""As soon as we post a photo, we get 400-500 comments on it,"" Ms Hawkey said. 
But transporting rescue dogs is not always a happy story - when Rory Cellan-Jones and his wife Diane rehomed their dog Sophie from Romania, she was left traumatised by the journey. 
According to the World Health Organization, there are an estimated 200 million street dogs in the world.
While it may be a happy ending for Rodney and the handful of other dogs who have been rehomed, Mr Harbison admitted that flying street dogs to forever homes abroad was not the solution.
Besides sterilising, he said one answer was to help provide locals with knowledge about food and medicine.
""I've nearly got a Thai foundation set up and now confirmation of a UK charity, so I will be able to hire people to help,"" Mr Harbison said. 
At the moment he relies on volunteers but is planning to ""put structures in place and find solutions all over the world"".
The next step in his mission is to build a hospital for sick dogs on Koh Samui which will be named after another of Mr Harbison's rescues to have captured the hearts of people around the world.
Golden retriever Tina, who was kept on a chain and used for breeding, became a feel-good story of hope for many who followed her journey.
""I have a feeling Tina has helped a lot more people than I even realised,"" Mr Harbison said.
""Her life will definitely not have been in vain.""

Inside Mali: What now for the country that bet its security on Wagner?,"As Mali fights Islamist militants and separatists, it has turned to Wagner mercenaries for security. But the group's leader is now presumed dead, UN peacekeepers are leaving and Mali faces a crisis. The BBC's Feras Kilani travelled to its dangerous northern desert region - the only international journalist to go there in the past year - to meet people caught up in the chaos. 
It was late in the evening when we set up camp, lit a fire to cook our dinner and laid down our blankets to sleep under the open sky. Suddenly the silence of the hot desert night was broken by the roar of a motorbike. 
Around us, we heard a series of clicks as the armed men in our convoy cocked their rifles and machine guns. We were with a group of Tuareg separatists who told the man on the motorbike to move on. 
As soon as he left, our hosts told us we had to leave too. Immediately. It was too risky to stay put as the man was a scout for a local group linked to al-Qaeda.
We had been careful, swapping our jeans for traditional robes and Tuareg headscarves to blend in, but if he realised foreigners were in the camp he could lead the militants to us and we could be kidnapped. 
We packed up as quickly as we could and drove off into the pitch black without any headlights or torches so that we couldn't be followed.  
This part of northern Mali is beyond government control and is run by groups of Tuareg separatists and Islamist extremists linked to al-Qaeda - they don't exactly get along but they have reached a mutual understanding to leave each other alone. But the tension and fear we experienced that night reflects a deepening crisis across the country as it slides deeper into lawlessness and chaos. 
The government has turned away from international peacekeeping forces, relying on Russia's Wagner group for security instead. But now the mercenaries' notorious leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is believed to have died in a plane crash, leaving questions over operations here and fears that Mali is in an even more precarious position.   
Further to the east, the Islamic State group has established itself and is trying to increase the area it controls. We wanted to meet the civilians caught up in the violence IS fighters have brought with them. So we drove more than 1,000km (650 miles) through the desert to the city of Kidal in the east of Mali. When we arrived, we saw camps where thousands of refugees are living after fleeing their homes. 
""Islamic State forced us to come here,"" Fatima told us, sitting on the floor of a makeshift tent - a rough piece of material propped up by a few branches. She is in her 60s and this is now her home, with her daughter and two of her grandchildren by her side. 
Her husband and son-in-law were killed when IS attacked the village where they used to live.  
""They killed all our men and burned all our food and animals,"" she added. Others told us similar stories of how their supplies of grain, sheep and camels had been destroyed, leaving them with nothing. Many of the youngest children we saw had no clothes or shoes. 
Fatima, and what remains of her family, walked hundreds of kilometres to reach Kidal from her old home in Menaka state in eastern Mali.
As we had seen for ourselves, travelling across the desert is tough. There are no paved roads, just rough routes marked in the sand by vehicles that have passed through before. The sand stretches as far as you can see, sometimes dotted with trees and shrubs. 
There's not much for people in Kidal, but at least they can survive. ""We found water and shelter, so we stayed,"" Fatima said. People in these camps get some basic assistance from local NGOs but there isn't much. 
We also met Musa Ag Taher, one of the few men in the camp. Islamic State fighters attacked his home too. ""When IS entered the town I buried myself until they left and then I managed to escape with my family,"" he said. He described how he dug a shallow pit in the ground and covered himself with sand to hide. He managed to escape with his four children. 
Though Kidal is safer than the areas Fatima and Musa left behind, there are fears the situation is about to get worse. 
In 2012, the military staged a coup, while rebels and Islamist fighters took control of the north, declaring an independent state in the region. A new interim government asked French troops to come and fight the Islamist extremists. A few months after their arrival in 2013, the UN sent an international force called Minusma to keep the peace.
The country's military leaders seized power again in 2020 - since then the junta has distanced itself from France, its former colonial ruler, and French troops have been sent home. 
In 2021 the government invited Wagner to Mali to help with security and soon the Russian mercenary group will be the only outside force providing military support. The government has told the UN's 12,000 peacekeepers to leave - they are now in the process of pulling out.
We visited a UN base in Kidal that is due to close in November. Huge sandbags topped with coils of razor wire had been set up around the entrance for security. Beyond, we could see people in blue helmets and rows of white vehicles with UN markings. 
The security guard at the gate called someone on his radio and three men appeared. They asked us to stop filming and explained that because they were preparing to leave they wouldn't be able to give us an interview. 
Local groups are worried that when these UN forces go, they will leave a power vacuum with IS, militants affiliated to al-Qaeda and separatists all fighting for control. 
There are believed to be about 1,000 Wagner soldiers in Mali - less than a tenth of the size of the UN force they are replacing and there are fears they will be even less effective at countering jihadist groups. 
And earlier this year, the UN accused Wagner of committing atrocities alongside the Malian army, describing ""alarming accounts of horrific executions, mass graves, acts of torture, rape and sexual violence"" in the Mopti area. It also described how Malian soldiers, overseen by Wagner fighters, killed around 500 mostly unarmed civilians in a village. The Malian government denied any wrongdoing.
At a nearby compound we met a group of separatists from the Tuareg ethnic group who control Kidal. They are worried that Mali's military government, who control the south of the country, might try to seize what is left of the UN base when the international force pulls out. He says this could lead to renewed fighting.
""If these camps are handed over by Minusma to the Malian army, Minusma will be responsible for what happens next,"" Bilal Ag Sharif,  the local Tuareg leader, told us.
""The Malian government will also be responsible because it is demanding something that is not its right, and we will not accept it,"" he added, making it clear his group will not give up control of the region without a struggle.
As well as providing security, the 12 UN bases across Mali also support about 10,000 local jobs. They employ translators, drivers, people to distribute food and provide services such as street lighting and some very basic healthcare. 
""It will leave these people without any work without any hope, without any source [of income] to feed their families,"" Sharif told us. He's worried Islamist militant groups will step in and benefit. 
""This will give extremist groups new opportunities for recruitment,"" he said.
In the refugee camp we had seen rows of children huddled on the ground of a makeshift school.
A teacher hit their heads with a cane as they recited verses from the Quran. 
Their parents had been killed by IS and it was easy to see how they could be targeted and recruited by militant groups as they grow up.
The motivation of the Wagner group in the region has been questioned, however. The US government has accused it of running gold and diamond mines in other African countries, saying it is a ""destabilising force"", mainly interested in profiting from natural resources.  
A few days before the plane crash in Russia, Yevgeny Prigozhin appeared in a video which suggested he was in Africa. 
The BBC has not been able to verify where the video was filmed, but in it, Prigozhin said the group was making Africa ""more free"" and that Wagner was exploring for minerals as well as fighting Islamist militants and other criminals.
Just outside Kidal, we visited one of Mali's many gold processing plants. It's only a small operation, with little heavy machinery and much of the panning and smelting is done by hand. 
But with hundreds of sites like this across the country, Mali manages to produce more than 60 tonnes of gold a year, making it one of Africa's top five exporters of the precious metal.
Tuareg groups are worried that Wagner soldiers might try to seize control of the local gold industry and sites like this one. If they do, Sharif warns there will be bloodshed.
The UN has warned that the threat from jihadist groups has increased across Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso in the past year. 
All three countries have had military coups, with civilian governments pushed out of power in Burkina Faso in 2022 and in Niger in July this year. 
And with Wagner's future now uncertain, it's unclear how much Mali can rely on the group for security. If the situation within the country deteriorates further, it could have a knock-on effect causing wider instability in the region.

Modi and Xi meeting: India and China agree to 'de-escalate' border tensions,"India and China have agreed to de-escalate tensions along their disputed border after a conversation between its leaders, a senior Indian official said. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping spoke on the sidelines of the Brics summit in South Africa on Wednesday.
Beijing said the meeting was held at Mr Modi's request.
Relations between India and China have been worsening for more than three years.
The two world powers are facing off against each other along their ill-defined 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long border - known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC) - in the Himalayan region.  
Mr Xi and Mr Modi met on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Johannesburg. The Brics countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - are often seen as a counterweight to the Western-led world.
On Thursday, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said that both sides had agreed to step up efforts for the disengagement of troops along the LAC.
""The Prime Minister underlined that maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas and observing and respecting the LAC are essential for the normalisation of the India-China relationship,"" Mr Kwatra said.
""In this regard, the two leaders agreed to direct their relevant officials to intensify efforts at expeditious disengagement and de-escalation,"" he added.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the two leaders had ""a candid and in-depth exchange of views on current China-India relations and other questions of shared interest"". 
""President Xi stressed that improving China-India relations serves the common interests of the two countries and peoples, and is also conducive to peace, stability and development of the world and the region,"" the statement said.
It also added: ""The two sides should bear in mind the overall interests of their bilateral relations and handle properly the border issue so as to jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border region.""
According to The Indian Express newspaper, no interpreters or note-takers were around when the two leaders spoke to each other. 
Mr Xi and Mr Modi last spoke on the sidelines of the G20 summit in 2022.
Mr Xi is expected to arrive in India for the G20 summit hosted by Delhi on 9 and 10 September.

Greece wildfires: 79 people arrested for arson,"Greece has called out ""arsonist scum"" after police made 79 arson arrests over wildfires ravaging the country.
Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said there had been several attempts by arsonists to start new fires on Mount Parnitha, north-west of Athens.
The blaze is one of hundreds in the nation where wildfires have already killed at least 20 people this week.
""You are committing a crime against the country,"" Mr Kikilias said.
""Arsonist scum are setting fires that threaten forests, property and, most of all, human lives,"" Mr Kikilias told Greeks during a televised emergency briefing on Thursday.
""You will not get away with it, we will find you, you will be held accountable.""
Summer wildfires are common in Greece and scientists have linked the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, to climate change.
Stefan Doerr, who directs the Centre for Wildfire Research at Swansea University, says that more flammable landscapes - due to hot weather or poor vegetation management - mean that arson and other incidents can more easily turn into fast-moving wildfires.
Police and Greek intelligence service EYP are investigating the incidents, AFP reported. 
Government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis told Greek public broadcaster ERT that of 140 wildfire-related arrests, 79 were related to arson. 
Hundreds of firefighters across Greece have been battling deadly wildfires.
The large fire front which erupted on Saturday near the port city of Alexandroupolis has become the EU's largest on record, according to European commissioner Janez Lenarcic.
Meanwhile, on Mount Parnitha near Athens, fires have been raging in a forest adjoining the capital, threatening a national park. 
Earlier this week, the bodies of 19 people believed to be migrants, with children among them, were found near the Evros region of north-eastern Greece. 
A shepherd also lost his life in the fires in the Boeotia region on Monday.
Mr Kikilias said on Wednesday the country was going through the worst summer since fire-risk maps were introduced in 2009.
Just last month, thousands of people were forced to flee fires on the Greek island of Rhodes after wildfires broke out there and in other parts of the country.

Ukraine aid worker Chris Parry's parents go on aid mission there,"The parents of a Cornish aid worker killed in Ukraine are journeying to the war-hit country.
Christine Parry said she would be ""following in their son Chris's footsteps,"" by joining her husband on his second mission there. 
They will be driving an ambulance as they deliver two vehicles to Lviv to help with humanitarian work.
Chris Parry, 28, from Truro, died alongside fellow volunteer Andrew Bagshaw in January. 
The pair were believed to be attempting to rescue a woman in Soledar when their car was hit by an artillery shell.
He had spent months rescuing people trapped on the war's frontline and bringing them to safety.
His father Rob Parry made a visit to Ukraine at the end of July and is preparing to return at the end of August with his wife Christine and their daughter, Kate.
Rob Parry said he had a ""really frightening"" experience on this last trip when an alert went off and then a ""really, really loud bang shook the whole hotel"".
Christine Parry said: ""I'll be glad when we actually are on that drive through Europe, however, I am a little bit nervous as well, so it's excitement tinged with some trepidation I have to say.
""It's following in Chris's footsteps, so we're doing good, it's going to be healing for us."" 
She said her son would have been ""tickled pink"" and ""so proud"" of their mission.
Mrs Parry added: ""We are entwined with Ukraine forever, anything we can do to help them, support them, encourage others to do so, we will do it, in Chris's name.
""We are definitely more enriched because of this.""

Trump's time in Fulton County Jail was brief. Others die waiting,"On Thursday, Donald Trump turned himself in to police in Fulton County, Georgia. The process took just minutes - but most other defendants are not so lucky. 
Mr Trump said in a fundraising email afterwards that he found conditions at the jail ""poor and disgraceful"". ""It's worse than you could even imagine,"" he wrote. ""It's violent. The building is falling apart.""
Yet the former president had a very different experience from those who languish in the county's notoriously unsafe jail for weeks, months or even years while awaiting trial.  
In the US, criminal defendants wait in a jail if they have been arrested, are awaiting trial without bail, or are serving a short sentence behind bars. Prisons are where criminals serve longer sentences after conviction. 
Hundreds of people were held at Fulton County Jail for more than 90 days because they had yet to be formally charged or could not afford to pay the bail bond required for their release, according to a September 2022 report from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The report also found 117 people had waited in jail for more than a year because they had not been indicted; 12 had been held for two years for the same reason.
""It's essentially been overcrowded since it was built,"" said Fallon McClure, the deputy director of policy and advocacy at the ACLU of Georgia. ""This has just been a perpetual cycle over and over for years.""
Built in 1985 to house around 1,300 inmates, Fulton County Jail has held more than 3,000 people in recent years. 
The jail provides ""unhygienic living conditions"" that have led to outbreaks of Covid-19, lice and scabies, a report by the Southern Center for Human Rights said. It found inmates were ""significantly malnourished"" and dealing with a condition called cachexia, also known as wasting syndrome.
Waiting in these dilapidated conditions has proven deadly for some.
This month, a 34-year-old man was found unconscious in a medical unit cell at the jail, where he had been held since 2019. He was resuscitated, but then died at the hospital, according to the Fulton County Sheriff's office.  
He was the sixth person this year to die in the county jail system in 2023. 
Noni Battiste-Kosoko was just 19 when she died in Fulton County Jail custody in July after being arrested on a less serious misdemeanour charge. Deputies found her unresponsive in her cell in the Atlanta City Detention Center, an additional space the county is leasing to alleviate overcrowding at the main jail. 
Battiste-Kosoko's family has still not been given a cause for her death or found out the results of her post-mortem examination, her family's lawyer told the BBC. 
""There has been a consistent and unsettling pattern of poor healthcare and inmates dying at the jail under mysterious circumstances,"" said Roderick Edmond. 
The Fulton County Sheriff's Office told the BBC it was still awaiting a final report from the autopsy, and that it was investigating the incident. 
Battiste-Kosoko's death came just before Fulton County this month agreed to pay $4m (£3.1m) to the family of a man who died in the jail covered in bed bug bites.
An independent autopsy found 35-year-old Lashawn Thompson died in the jail's psychiatric wing last September because of ""severe neglect"" from jail staff. His death sparked an investigation from the US Department of Justice into conditions at the jail, access to medical care and excessive use of force by officers.
When it was built in the 1980s, the jail was ""state of the art"", said Dr Edmond, the attorney. ""But it is no longer. That jail needs to be demolished and the citizens of Fulton County need to dig deep and pay the tax dollars to build a brand new jail.""
The Fulton County Sheriff's Office itself has acknowledged conditions at the building are ""dilapidated and rapidly eroding"". It has also called for the construction of a new $1.7bn jail.
""There's been a lot of talk of cleaning it up,"" said Ms McClure of the ACLU. ""We have not really seen or heard anything particularly significant. It seems like a lot of posturing."" 
Ms McClure said a number of factors have led to overcrowding in the Fulton County Jail system. For one, people charged with misdemeanours in the county are arrested and taken into custody, unlike some other Georgia jurisdictions, where defendants are generally released and given a future court date for minor offences, she said. 
The county has also faced a backlog of cases because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and most recently, a slew of indictments under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act unrelated to the Trump case, she said. 
Mr Trump and his co-defendants were charged for violating the same statute. But indictments under the law, passed in the 1970s to help take down organised crime groups like the mafia, are complex and resource intensive, experts say.  
""There's the assumption that other cases aren't getting indicted because this is taking up so much time,"" Ms McClure said.
On Thursday, Mr Trump was fingerprinted and had his mugshot taken. He was given an identification number and details of his charges, his height and weight, and his home city were published on the Fulton County website. 
But it's there that the similarities between the former president and the average inmate end. 
Mr Trump travelled to and from the jail with a large police escort, and his visit lasted around 20 minutes. Authorities have cited heightened security concerns in making special arrangements.

The contrast in experiences rankled some defence attorneys who have worked in Fulton County for years.
""He's gonna be treated with kid gloves because he's a former president,"" said Keisha Steed, an Atlanta-area criminal defence attorney who once worked as a public defender. 
""And our clients are going to be kicked in the teeth.""

Fukushima: What are the concerns over waste water release?,"Japan's controversial plan to release treated waste water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean has sparked anxiety and anger at home and abroad.
Since the 2011 tsunami which severely damaged the plant, more than a million tonnes of treated waste water has accumulated there. Japan began discharging it on 24 August, in a process that will take 30 years to complete.
Despite an endorsement from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the plan has been deeply controversial in Japan with local communities expressing concerns about contamination.
Fishing industry groups in Japan and the wider region are also worried about their livelihoods, as they fear consumers will avoid buying seafood. 
China has accused Japan of treating the ocean as its ""private sewer"", and criticised the IAEA of being ""one-sided"". While South Korea's government has said it has no objections to the plan, many of its citizens are opposed to it. 
So what is Japan's plan and how exactly has it churned the waters? 
Since the disaster, power plant company Tepco has been pumping in water to cool down the Fukushima nuclear reactors' fuel rods. This means every day the plant produces contaminated water, which is stored in massive tanks. 
More than 1,000 tanks have been filled, and Japan says that it needs the land occupied by the tanks to build new facilities to safely decommission the plant. It has also pointed out concerns that the tanks could collapse in a natural disaster.
Releasing treated waste water into the ocean is a routine practice for nuclear plants - though critics have pointed out that the amount from Fukushima is on an unprecedented, far vaster scale.
Tepco filters the Fukushima water through its Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS), which reduces most radioactive substances to acceptable safety standards, apart from tritium and carbon-14. 
Tritium and carbon-14 are, respectively, radioactive forms of hydrogen and carbon, and are difficult to separate from water. They are widely present in the natural environment, water and even in humans, as they are formed in the Earth's atmosphere and can enter the water cycle. 
Both emit very low levels of radiation, but can pose a risk if consumed in large quantities.
The filtered water goes through another treatment, and is then diluted with seawater to reduce the remaining substances' concentrations, before it is released into the ocean via a 1km underground tunnel. Tepco will monitor the radioactivity of the processed water at various stages as well as the ocean water at the discharge site.
A system of emergency valves will ensure no undiluted waste water is accidentally released, says Tepco, and staff can also manually shut down the discharge quickly in case of a tsunami or earthquake.
Japan's government says the final level of tritium - about 1,500 becquerels per litre - is much safer than the level required by regulators for nuclear waste discharge, or by the World Health Organization for drinking water. Tepco has said the carbon-14 level would also meet standards.
Tepco and the Japanese government have conducted studies to show the discharged water will present little risk to humans and marine life.
Many scientists have also backed the plan.
Mark Foreman, an expert in nuclear chemistry with Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, said the water would not make the sea much more radioactive than it already is.
He said the impact of the annual radiation doses from the discharge into the ocean were lower than dental x-rays or mammograms - even for those who eat a lot of seafood.
""The water released will be a drop in the ocean, both in terms of volume and radioactivity.  There is no evidence that these extremely low levels of radioisotopes have a detrimental health effect,"" said molecular pathology expert Gerry Thomas.

Fukushima fishermen worried about nuclear water release plan
Despite years of government assurances, the plan remains deeply controversial to the Japanese public. Only 53% said they support it, while 41% said they did not, in a survey conducted in August by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
UN-appointed human rights experts have opposed the plan, as have environmental activists. Greenpeace has released reports casting doubt on Tepco's treatment process, alleging it does not go far enough in removing radioactive substances. 
Critics say Japan should, for the time being, keep the treated water in the tanks. They argue this buys time to develop new processing technologies, and allow any remaining radioactivity to naturally reduce. 
There are also some scientists who are uncomfortable with the plan. They say it requires more studies on how it would affect the ocean bed and marine life. 
""We've seen an inadequate radiological, ecological impact assessment that makes us very concerned that Japan would not only be unable to detect what's getting into the water, sediment and organisms, but if it does, there is no recourse to remove it... there's no way to get the genie back in the bottle,"" marine biologist Robert Richmond, a professor with the University of Hawaii, told the BBC's Newsday programme.
Tatsujiro Suzuki, a nuclear engineering professor from Nagasaki University's Research Center for Nuclear Weapons Abolition, told the BBC the plan would ""not necessarily lead to serious pollution or readily harm the public - if everything goes well"".
But given that Tepco failed to prevent the 2011 disaster, he remains concerned about a potential accidental release of contaminated water, he said.
China has been the most vocal, accusing Japan of violating ""international moral and legal obligations"" and ""putting its selfish interests above the long-term wellbeing of the entire humanity"".
Shortly after Japan started releasing the water,Beijing widened an existing ban on seafood from Fukushima and some prefectures to cover the whole of Japan. China is the biggest buyer of Japanese seafood.
The two countries currently have a prickly relationship, with Japan's recent military build-up, its closer relationship to the US and China's provocative moves around Taiwan raising tensions.
In contrast to China, Seoul - which has been keen to build ties with Japan - has soft-pedalled its concerns. It says it ""respects"" the IAEA's findings and has endorsed the plan.
But this approach has angered the South Korean public, 80% of whom are worried about the water release according to a recent poll.
""The government enforces a strong no-littering policy at sea… But now the government is not saying a word (to Japan) about the wastewater flowing into the ocean,"" Park Hee-jun, a South Korean fisherman told BBC Korean. 
""Some of the officials say we should remain quiet if we don't want to make consumers even more anxious. I think that's nonsense.""
Thousands have attended protests in Seoul calling for government action, as some shoppers fearing food supply disruptions have stockpiled salt and other necessities.
In response, South Korea's parliament passed a resolution in late June opposing the water release plan - though it is unclear what impact this would have on Japan's decision. Officials are also launching ""intense inspections"" of seafood, and are sticking to an existing ban of Japanese seafood imports from regions around the Fukushima plant. 
To assuage the public's fears, prime minister Han Duck-soo said he would be willing to drink the Fukushima water to show it is safe, while one official said that only a small fraction of the discharge would end up in Korean waters. 
Meanwhile the Pacific Islands Forum regional group has called the plan ""another major nuclear contamination disaster"", as several of its members are still dealing with the consequences of US nuclear testing.
Japanese authorities and Tepco have launched extensive public education campaigns, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has promised ""a high level of transparency"".
Tepco has also promised to publish online real-time data on the water's radioactivity levels, on an online portal devoted to explaining the treatment and discharge processes in multiple languages.
Foreign delegations and media outlets, including the BBC, have been invited for tours of the processing facilities, and on the diplomatic front Tokyo has engaged in talks with its neighbours.
In materials published on its foreign affairs ministry website, Japan also pointed out that other nuclear plants in the region - particularly those in China - discharge water with much higher levels of tritium. The BBC was able to verify some of these figures with publicly available data from Chinese nuclear plants.
But the biggest vindication may lie with the IAEA report, released by the agency's chief Rafael Grossi while visiting Japan in July. 
The report, which came after a two year investigation, found that Tepco and Japanese authorities were meeting international safety standards on several aspects including facilities, inspections and enforcement, environmental monitoring, and radioactivity assessments.
Mr Grossi said the plan would have a ""negligible radiological impact on people and the environment"". 
Yet, Japan's decision to start discharging the Fukushima water has set the stage for an intensified showdown with its critics.

What are the charges in Trump's Georgia indictment?,"Former US President Donald Trump has been arrested on 13 charges in Georgia for his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state.
The 98-page indictment, issued on 14 August, claims that Mr Trump ""unlawfully conspired"" to change the election outcome while participating in a ""criminal enterprise"".
Other charges include false claims of election fraud and solicitation of violation of oath.
He denies all the charges against him.
Mr Trump said the indictment, which contains 18 additional defendants, including his former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, is politically motivated and a ""massive fraud"". 
It is the fourth criminal case brought against him in as many months.
Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who launched the investigation, said Mr Trump and the other 18 defendants have until noon local time on 25 August to ""voluntarily surrender"".

Canada considers foreign student cap over housing crisis,"Canada is considering a first-ever cap on international students as it tries to solve its housing affordability crisis. Could the measure make a difference? 
This week, Canadian Housing Minister Sean Fraser floated the idea of capping how many students Canada lets in from abroad as a way to help tackle the country's inflated housing costs. 
He said it was ""one of the options that we ought to consider"".
His remarks come as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces growing criticism for failing to solve the housing crisis. 
The reaction to Mr Fraser's remarks was swift, with the idea criticised by universities, as well as the province of Quebec, who says it would reject efforts to limit international students. 
Canada accepted a record number of international students in 2022 - more than 800,000, a 75% increase from five years ago. 
On the heels of Mr Fraser's remarks, Immigration Minister Marc Miller said Canada would also take a look at its immigration targets to see whether it has an impact on the housing crunch. 
Canada has promised to welcome 1.5 million new immigrants by 2025 - but questions are growing about how to accept newcomers at that pace if there is nowhere to house them. 
But experts say limiting new arrivals will do little to address the problem.
For many in Canada, the struggle to pay their mortgage or rent is a persistent reality.
The average home price in Canada was around C$750,000 ($550,000;£435,000) as of August. That represents an increase of 360% from the year 2000, when the average was C$163,000. 
The issue is especially acute in large cities like Toronto, where a six-figure annual income is needed to afford a house. Houses now typically sell for more than C$1m in Toronto and Vancouver. 
Both are often ranked among the world's top 10 most unaffordable places to live in, according to the Dermographia International Housing Affordability Index, ranking alongside cities like Hong Kong and San Francisco.
Rent is also becoming more expensive in Canada's major cities. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto is C$2,500 - a 25% increase from last year. 
In recent years, those living in smaller cities across Canada have begun to feel the crunch, too. 
It is a long-standing national problem, and one that politicians from all levels of government have repeatedly promised to fix over the last decade. 
One cause is a housing shortage, as population growth - largely fuelled by immigration - outpaces the number of homes being built. 
Canada needs to build 5.8 million new homes, including two million rental units, by 2030 to solve the problem, according to the country's national housing agency.

Why it takes 30 years to buy a house in Canada
That is about 828,000 new homes a year - more than three times the 260,000 homes built in 2022. 
In recent years, the government has tried different measures to address the issue.
This includes putting a ban on foreign property ownership as of January in a bid to reduce competitiveness in the market. 
Paul Kershaw, a public policy professor and founder of a housing think tank, said that while foreign ownership and a growing population play a role in Canada's housing problems, putting the blame solely on those factors is looking ""for the easy villain"".
""They are easy targets because it lets the rest of us and Canada think we're not entangled in this issue, and we are,"" he said.
Prof Kershaw pointed out that current homeowners benefit financially from rising property values, fuelling a culture of inequality around who owns and who doesn't.
The real estate industry - including the buying, selling, and renting of units - makes up the largest share of Canada's overall GDP at 13%, according to 2020 figures by Statistics Canada. 
This means the sector is a large driver for economic growth and a lucrative investment opportunity for those able to participate. 
Prof Kershaw said he believes things are unlikely to change until Canadians begin to view housing as ""homes first and investment second"". 
For international students like Amin Kamaleddinezabadi, it's no secret that there are barriers to finding affordable housing off-campus. 
The 30-year-old from Iran, who just completed his PhD in biomedical engineering at the University of Toronto, told the BBC that international students are sometimes asked to pay six months worth of rent in advance because they don't have a credit record in the country. 
Rental prices have only increased since he began his studies in 2016, he said. 
""Most international students rely on their own funding, and with the higher tuition fees they pay, it can be a really big burden for them financially,"" Mr Kamaleddinezabadi said. 
Despite these challenges, he said he believes there are many benefits to living in Toronto, where he now works. 
He cautioned there may be adverse effects to reducing the number of international students in Canada. 
""International students who pursue higher education in Canada tend to integrate well into the country by the time they graduate, making them a valuable asset to Canada's long-term economic growth,"" he said. 
""The Canadian government should prioritise them in any immigration program … and not penalise them because of the historic housing issues in our country.""
In a statement, Universities Canada, which represents dozens of universities across the country, said tying international students to the country's housing crisis is ""deeply concerning"".
Prof Kershaw said housing is a complex issue and that the government needs a multi-pronged approach to match.
This includes addressing both housing supply and affordability, but also how important real estate is to Canada's wealth.
""If we don't have that clarity of purpose, then we will permit our policies to work at cross purposes - and that is absolutely one thing at play right now,"" he said.

Maui County sues Hawaiian Electric over wildfire negligence,"Maui County is suing energy firm Hawaiian Electric, saying it failed to turn off electric equipment before wildfires started on the island.
If power lines had been switched off during exceptionally high winds and dry conditions, the destruction could have been avoided, the lawsuit said.
The Lahaina fire killed 115 and more than 1,000 people are still missing..
The company says it is disappointed the county chose to sue while the fire investigation was ongoing.  
Witnesses say they saw sparks from power lines which ignited fires after utility poles were damaged by winds, caused by a passing hurricane.
The lawsuit said the utility company knew high winds ""would topple power poles, knock down power lines, and ignite vegetation"".
The company was warned in advance of dangerous wildfire conditions by the National Weather Service, the lawsuit added.
""Defendants also knew that if their overhead electrical equipment ignited a fire, it would spread at a critically rapid rate,"" it said.
""Severe and catastrophic losses... could have easily been prevented"" if the firm had a safety shut-off plan during high wind events, similar to that of other utility companies, it suggested.
It further claimed that Hawaiian Electric had a duty to properly maintain and repair its power lines and keep vegetation trimmed to prevent contact with overhead lines and other electric equipment.
The county said it is seeking compensation for damage to public property and resources in Lahaina and in nearby Kula.
In a statement to the BBC on Thursday, Hawaiian Electric said that since the fires, it had been focused on doing what it could to support the people of Maui.
""We are very disappointed that Maui County chose this litigious path while the investigation is still unfolding.""
The wildfire that ripped through Hawaiian town of Lahaina on 8 August destroyed most of the historic town and the fires are now considered the worst natural disaster in Hawaii state history.
Authorities are now expected to make public a list of the missing in the coming days to try to narrow the search.
Search teams combing through the rubble are finding only bones or fragments of bodies.
The county said: ""Maui County stands alongside the people and communities of Lahaina and Kula to recover public resource damages and rebuild after these devastating utility-caused fires.
""These damages include losses to public infrastructure, fire response costs, losses to revenues, increased costs, environmental damages, and losses of historical or cultural landmarks.""
Temporarily shutting off power to reduce fire risk is a tactic used in western US states, where wildfires are common. In California, power lines have been blamed for half of the state's most destructive wildfires.

São Paulo's micro-houses keeping homeless families off the streets,"The minhocão is one of São Paulo's most famous landmarks. An elevated highway that snakes its way through the centre of the city, it weaves through the tightly packed apartment buildings to connect the east to the west.  
The road's official name is the Elevado Presidente João Goulart. But people here prefer to call it by its nickname, the minhocão, a reference to a giant mythical beast that roamed the forests of South America.   
As much as it dominates the city with its sheer size, the minhocão also provides shelter for a growing number of people. 
For underneath the elevated road, more and more homeless families are erecting tents, driven out of their homes by rising rent and having to sleep rough.  
Many others have to make do with blankets handed to them by the city council. 
And every day gets harder as the winter sets in.   
São Paulo's authorities estimate around 34,000 people are sleeping rough on the streets this year while figures from the Federal University of Minas Gerais put the number closer to 50,000.
The homeless population has soared more than 31% since the pandemic, and the number of families sleeping rough has risen 111% in the same time period, according to the city council.  
With growing numbers of people needing help, the traditional strategies of soup kitchens and shelters are falling short. 
So this year the city has come up with a new temporary solution: the micro-house.   
The first village of micro-houses was built close to the banks of the Tiete River, in the neighbourhood of Canindé. 
Home to one of São Paulo's original favelas, today the site houses 20 or so families, each living in a little box that looks similar to a shipping container and measures 18 sq m. 
A square with a playground gives the area a community feel. Children are playing with toys, their parents sitting on benches and watching on.   
The aim is to build a total of 1,000 such houses across the city by the end of the year, housing 4,000 people.   
""It's a way of looking after people based on the well-known international concept of Housing First, offering housing as the first step in helping to get them back on their feet,"" explains Carlos Bezerra Junior, who is the social welfare secretary at São Paulo City Hall, which is in charge of the project.  
Daniela Martins, 30, walks me around her micro-house. 
She shares a double bed with her husband Rafael, 32, and their four-year-old daughter Sofia. On the opposite wall, there's a cot for three-month-old baby Henri. 
The corner kitchen has a small stove, a sink and a fridge, and next to it is a simple bathroom.   
The Covid-19 pandemic hit the family hard. Rafael lost his job as a sales assistant and Daniela's work as a cleaner dried up. 
They lived in a shelter for eight months before this opportunity came up.   
""This is a place where we are trying to get back to living in society, to be human again, you know?"" explains Rafael. ""We just want a normal life - so many employers think that people who live in a shelter are bad people.""  
The stigma that comes with losing a home makes getting back on your feet that much harder, say experts from homeless charities.
""Traditionally, those who are living on the streets are mostly male with some mental problems and issues with their families,"" says Raquel Rolnik, professor at the Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning of the University of São Paulo. 
""Now we are talking about entire families living on the street. So clearly the issue is housing - the idea that the city administration is mobilising to address the topic of housing is good news.""   
But, she says, the micro-houses are not a perfect solution. 
""There is a lot of criticism about the format, the concentration of tiny homes grouped together in the same place, forming ghettos,"" she explains. 
She criticises the lack of urban planning and thinks better use could be made of existing, often abandoned, housing to make that habitable too. 
Brazil is a country infamous for its inequality and immense favelas. But even these least desirable spaces - large areas of makeshift housing built by squatters - have become unaffordable for many.   
""Of course it's free for the first ones who squat, but not free for the second, for the third or for the 10th,"" says Raquel Rolnik. 
""They are also based on business activities - an activity of providing what is not provided in the formal market. And this in the context of a total absence of a housing policy."" 
São Paulo's largest favela is Paraisópolis (Paradise City in English), a name resident Eliane Carmo da Silva, who lives in a cramped room with mould growing on the walls, finds ironic.   
Her home is in a little alleyway off the main road, on the ground floor, with at least two more floors of informally built flats above her. 
Eliane and her husband pay $73 (£58) a month for a space large enough for a double bed, a cooker and a fridge but little more. 
It is more than they can currently afford to pay. Their granddaughter, Rennylly Victoria, has a heart condition and the little they earn goes on the medication that keeps her alive. 
While their landlord is understanding, it is getting harder to make ends meet, even though they receive food and aid from local charities.   
""This month we had to use some rent money to buy her medicines,"" Eliane explains, adding ""I will never let her die.""  
And she will not let her ambition die either. ""At the moment, paying rent [means] we don't make ends meet. Without donations, things would be incredibly difficult,"" she says. 
""My dream is to have my own house of course - work to earn money and keep pushing through.""

Three reasons why Trump's case in Georgia is different,"This video can not be played
Watch: Trump's surrender at Georgia jail explained...in 90 seconds
Donald Trump turned himself in as expected on Thursday in Georgia to be charged with an election plot. That process - and the coming arraignment - may follow a script unlike his previous three arrests this year.
During bookings in New York, Florida and Washington DC - where the former president has pleaded not guilty - he got special treatment.
Here's why this time will be different.
The former president has until now been spared a booking photo and having to interact with other criminal defendants. 
But Fulton County Sheriff Pat Labat has said the department's ""normal practices"" will be followed when processing Mr Trump. These practices typically include a medical screening, fingerprinting and a warrants check. 
A number of his alleged co-conspirators have already been booked into the Fulton County Jail, which is notorious for hazardous conditions that some inmates endure for months. 
Mr Trump was also subjected to his first mugshot on Thursday, as the county's normal steps include photographing all its defendants. 
""The Fulton County Jail, amongst jails, is a very disturbingly dysfunctional place,"" said Rachel Kaufman, an attorney in Atlanta. 
Mr Trump and his 18 co-defendants ""are going to witness some level of that dysfunction"" when processed, she said. 
Still, the former president wasn't kept in a holding cell overnight like many other defendants - he was in and out in about 20 minutes. 
""He's not going to feel the full force of what an average person experiences in the Fulton County Jail when they've been charged with several felonies,"" said Ms Kaufman. 
""And what they experience is their life being put at risk.""
Mr Trump's arraignment in Georgia - where he is expected to plead not guilty - could be the first time the public actually sees him in court. 
To date, video cameras have not been allowed during Mr Trump's arraignments in New York, Washington DC and Miami. 
That's because New York state and federal courtrooms do not usually allow video and microphone recordings. 
But the state of Georgia does. 
It's up to the judge to decide whether cameras are allowed, said Ms Kaufman, adding that the judge assigned to Mr Trump's arraignment, Scott McAfee, has often allowed them in the past. 
""He's a full transparency judge,"" she said. ""My guess is that whatever happens in front of him is going to be televised.""
That could mean cameras in the courtroom for Mr Trump's potential trial, too.
It would not be the first time that one of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' high-profile cases took place on screen. 
In 2014 and 2015, an eight-month long trial involving a controversial Atlanta Public School cheating scandal was broadcast on television and radio, capturing the attention of locals. 
Mr Trump floated the idea of pardoning himself before leaving the White House in 2021, and some have suggested he might attempt to do so in the criminal cases against him if elected president in 2024. 
But experts say that would be much harder for the top Republican candidate to pull off in the state of Georgia. 
For one, presidents can only issue pardons for federal crimes, and Mr Trump is facing state charges in Georgia. 
Mr Trump would not be able to appeal to Georgia's governor for a pardon either, because unlike many other states, the governor there is not allowed to issue them. 
Instead, Georgia's State Board of Pardons and Paroles is responsible for issuing pardons, which it only does five years after a convicted person has completed his or her sentence. 
Mr Trump is facing up to 20 years in prison in Georgia if convicted of the most severe charge of racketeering.

"EU safety laws start to bite for TikTok, Instagram and others","Some of the biggest tech organisations and search engines now have to comply with new EU rules designed to protect users.
Under the EU Digital Services Act (DSA) rule-breakers can face big fines.
Nineteen major platforms, such as Facebook or TikTok, face the most stringent rules which include having plans in place to protect children and stop election interference.
Many have made changes, some of which will affect users in the UK.
While the UK Online Safety Bill is still working its way through parliament - the EU's Digital Services Act became law on 16 November 2022.
But firms were given time to make sure their systems complied.
On 25 April the commission named the very large online platforms - those with over 45 million EU users - that would be subject to the toughest rules. They are: Alibaba, AliExpress, Amazon Store, the Apple App Store, Booking.com, Facebook, Google Play, Google Maps, Google Shopping, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Wikipedia, YouTube and Zalando. Search engines Google and Bing will also be subject to the rules.
They had four months to comply with the act's rules. Smaller tech services won't have to comply until next year.
Breaches could lead to a fine of 6% of turnover and potentially suspension of the service.
There are extra requirements in the DSA for these very large platforms and search engines. They have to assess potential risks they may cause, report that assessment and put in place measures to deal with the problem. This includes risks related to:
Targeted advertising based on profiling children is no longer permitted.
They must also share with regulators details of how their algorithms work. This could include those which decide what adverts users see, or which posts appear in their feed. And they are required to have systems for sharing data with independent researchers.
In blog posts, and in statements given to the BBC, organisations have stressed the effort the put in to comply. Both TikTok and Meta said more than 1,000 people across their businesses had worked on complying with the act.
Many have already implemented changes. A number focus on personalised advertisements and feeds including:
There were also commitments to provide more data to researchers: Google promised to increase data access for those hoping to understand more about how Google Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Play and Shopping work.
Some have not yet detailed the changes they have made when asked to do so by the BBC. X, formerly called Twitter, simply said it was ""on track"" to meet its compliance deadlines.
Retailers Zalando and Amazon have mounted legal action to contest their designation as a very large online platform. Amazon argues they are not the largest retailer in any of the EU countries where they operate.
Nevertheless Amazon has taken steps to comply with the act and has ""created a new channel for submitting notices against suspected illegal products and content"". Zalando told the BBC it will be compliant with the act.
Wikipedia has made some changes in response to the DSA but the Foundation which supports the project says they should not affect users everyday experiences. It argues that the approach to regulation in the DSA is preferable to the approach of the online safety bill. It has said some of the requirements in the UK legislation would be hard for it to comply with.
Phil Bradley-Schmieg, legal counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation told the BBC: ""Our hope is that lawmakers emulate the DSA; understand the diverse internet ecosystem; and protect safe, free, and public projects online. ""

Rohingya: Gang violence stalks world's largest refugee camp,"Sounds of gunfire keep Modina Khatun awake every night in Cox's Bazaar Bangladesh - the world's largest refugee camp. 
She fears that spiralling gang violence there will make a widow of another Rohingya woman like herself, with young children to feed.
Ms Khatun's husband, Bashir Ullah, became a grim statistic last June when he was shot dead after getting caught in the crossfire of two gangs at Cox's Bazar in south-east Bangladesh. That night, he volunteered to patrol the sprawling camp that the Rohingyas have called home for six years now.
Drug smuggling and human trafficking gangs have turned life at Cox's Bazar into a nightmare for the close to one million ethnic minority Rohingyas, many of whom crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar in 2017 to escape a military crackdown. Forty-eight people have died in gang violence as of mid-July, exceeding the 40 fatalities for all of 2022.
The violence complicates the plight of the Rohingyas. Their return to Myanmar is uncertain while their host, Bangladesh considers them a burden. Squalid conditions in Cox's Bazar have also made them vulnerable to disasters, like massive fires and typhoons.
Those feelings of frustration and helplessness are being exploited by various armed groups such as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO) and the Munna Gang.
""We fled from the Myanmar military to save our lives. I hardly imagined that my husband would be killed in our camp by another Rohingya,"" Ms Khatun, 31, told the BBC.
""I cannot sleep at night. We want to leave the camp. I don't know what the future holds for me and my sons,"" she added. 
Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, a senior official in charge of Bangladesh's Refugee Relief and Repatriation commission said drug peddlers were using Rohingya as carriers to smuggle drugs from Myanmar into Bangladesh.
""There are a million people without any opportunities. That creates space for criminals. They are violent and need to be held to account,"" Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch told the BBC.
 Mohib Ullah, a prominent Rohingya rights leader is among the victims of the spiralling violence. He was shot dead while speaking to a refugee gathering in September 2021. The groups are also accused of abducting people for ransom, as well as forced marriage and child recruitment.
One of their former captives, who asked to be identified only as Nur, told the BBC that he had been tortured while being held in a forest area near the border town of Teknaf for four days.
""I was made to stand in a stream day and night and was constantly beaten with wires and sticks. I thought I won't make it,"" said the 21-year-old who now lives in a south-east Asian capital.
Nur said the ARSA militants demanded a ransom of $18,000 (£14,126) for his release, but his parents raised only about $2300. He managed to escape after the group asked for the remainder of the ransom. A spokesman for ARSA did not respond to a request for comment.
Bangladeshi authorities say their worries of deteriorating security in the Rohingya areas are becoming a reality.
The UN and aid agencies find themselves stretched for resources to provide for the Rohingyas as international attention shifts to the war in Ukraine. Monthly food vouchers have been cut to $8 from $12 per person.
Bangladesh says it has deployed more than 2,000 personnel from the Armed Police Battalion to secure refugee camps. But the only solution to stop the violence, authorities say, is to repatriate the Rohingyas back to Myanmar.
Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed on a possible repatriation of refugees in 2017 but there has been little progress.
In recent months, Myanmar has shown some interest in taking back some refugees, if not all, following a China-backed initiative. More than 1,000 Rohingya have been shortlisted to be sent back in a pilot project.
But the Rohingyas are not happy with this. 
""Unless our safety and security are guaranteed, unless we are allowed to go back to our villages, we are not keen on repatriation,"" says a Rohingya activist who did not want to be identified.
With their fate uncertain, dozens of Rohingya are taking perilous high seas journeys via seas aboard rickety boats to escape to Indonesia and Malaysia, often paying huge sum to human traffickers. Dozens drown every year attempting the sea crossing.
Six years after reaping worldwide praise for accepting Rohingya refugees, Bangladesh now faces a huge dilemma.
With foreign aid dwindling, Dhaka says it's spending more of its own resources to manage the camps. At the same time, the worsening security situation is triggering alarm.
And widows of the violence, like Ms Khatun, continue to live a nightmare.

Putin breaks silence over Prigozhin's reported death,"This video can not be played
Watch: Putin's first words on Prigozhin plane crash
Vladimir Putin has broken his silence over Yevgeny Prigozhin's reported death - some 24 hours after the Wagner chief's private jet crashed.
Russia's president said the head of the mercenary group was a ""talented person"" who ""made serious mistakes in life"".
Mr Putin also sent condolences to the families of all 10 people said to be on board the plane that went down north-west of Moscow on Wednesday evening.
However, he stopped short of explicitly confirming Prigozhin's death. 
From the moment the plane came down, there has been frenzied speculation about what caused the deadly crash and whether Prigozhin was indeed on board, as stated on the passenger list. 
At a briefing on Thursday, a Pentagon spokesperson said the US believed the Wagner chief was likely killed in the crash. 
Villagers near the crash site in the Tver region say they heard a loud bang before seeing a plane falling out of the sky. 
One of the theories being investigated is whether a bomb was smuggled on board, reports in Russian media suggest.
A US official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the most likely cause appeared to be an explosion aboard the aircraft. 
What caused the explosion was not known, although a bomb was one possibility, the official added.
Another theory, raised by a Prigozhin-linked Telegram channel, suggested that the jet had been shot down by Russian anti-aircraft forces. This has not been confirmed, and on Thursday the Pentagon said there was no information to indicate this.
Ground staff in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport - where the plane took off heading for St Petersburg - are being questioned, and CCTV footage is being checked.
Prigozhin - the leader of Russia's Wagner mercenary group - was once known as a Putin loyalist.
But after leading a short-lived mutiny in Russia in June, many observers described him as a ""dead man walking"".
The Kremlin stayed conspicuously silent after the crash. The following morning, President Putin even addressed the Brics summit in South Africa via video-link - but made no mention of the crash that much of the world was talking about.
On Thursday evening, however, that changed.
""I would like to above all express words of the most sincere condolences to the families of all those who have died,"" he said in a televised meeting at his Kremlin residence.
Initial data, he continued, suggested that ""Wagner employees"" were on board.
""These are people who have made a significant contribution to our common cause of fighting the neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine,"" Mr Putin said, repeating the Kremlin's false narrative that Ukraine is aligned with Nazism.
He used this accusation to justify his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Turning to Prigozhin himself, Mr Putin said he had known him since the early 90s, and described him as a ""man with a complicated life"".
The Russian leader also had praise for Prigozhin and his fighters, in particular for their actions in Ukraine. 
""He made serious mistakes in life. But he achieved results both for himself, and for the common good when I asked for it - like in the last few months.""
Despite speaking about Prigozhin in the past tense and offering his sympathy to the families of the victims, Mr Putin did not confirm the Wagner chief's death. 
When Prigozhin and his armed men - including many convicts - launched their insurrection two months ago, Mr Putin described their actions as ""treachery"" and a ""stab in the back of Russia"". 
He vowed to punish the perpetrators, who called off their march on Moscow only about 200km (125 miles) from the capital.
However a deal was later reached that saw Wagner fighters given a choice - either join the Russian army or move to neighbouring Belarus, and you will face no punishment.
The rollback surprised both ordinary Russians and experts, who were puzzled that the Wagner boss was apparently being allowed to travel freely across Russia and, it seemed, internationally.
The Russian defence ministry has not commented.
Russian forensic experts are now reported to have started the victims' identification, but Mr Putin said DNA tests would take time.
According to Russia's civil aviation authority, Wagner co-founder Dmitry Utkin and the man who looked after Wagner's finances, Valeriy Chekalov were also on the plane.
All seven passengers and three crew members on board the plane are believed to have died.

"California shooting: Four killed, six hurt in Cook's Corner bar","Four people have been killed and six others hurt in a shooting incident at a biker bar in southern California.
The gunman, identified on Thursday as a retired police officer, was among the four who died at Cook's Corner in Orange County.
Two of the six who were injured are in critical condition, county fire chief Brian Fennessy said.
There have been more than 400 mass shootings in 2023 alone, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
The shooting took place at 19:00 local time (02:00 GMT) as the bar was offering an $8 (£6.30) spaghetti night and a rock music show, which were advertised on the bar's Facebook page.
It is thought the incident may have started as a domestic incident between the gunman and his wife, CBS News reported citing a police source.
On Thursday, authorities named the suspect as John Snowling, a retired sergeant who worked with the Ventura Police Department in California until 2014.
At least one weapon was recovered from the scene, police said.
Orange County supervisor Katrina Foley said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that she was ""heartbroken to hear of another senseless mass shooting, this time in our own backyard"".
Senator Dave Min from Orange county said he was ""devastated"" by the news.
""Our district is one of the safest areas in the country, and yet we too are repeatedly afflicted with the scourge of mass shootings,"" he said.
Cook's Corner is a popular stop for bikers driving though the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains.
Its patrons include Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and former California governor, who hosted a reception there in 2006, arriving on a motorcycle.
Gun control is a politically charged subject in the US. 
While polls show that a majority of Americans are in favour of stricter gun laws, many Republicans oppose such a move.

Runcorn charity fraudster who fled to Turkey jailed,"A fraudster who fled to Turkey before her sentencing has been deported back to the UK to face justice.
Donna Wells, 41, defrauded a charity in Halton out of more than £150,000 while working as a service manager.
Cheshire Police said the stolen money should have been used to help people struggling with alcohol, drugs and mental health issues.
Wells, from Runcorn, failed to attend the hearing where she was sentenced to four years in prison on 5 June.
She had pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation and acquiring criminal property between January 2018 and January 2020 at an earlier hearing. 
Officers were alerted in December 2020 of financial irregularities at Young Addaction Halton, relating to payments being made to unknown suppliers, petty cash payments, and card payments.
An audit by the charity revealed a large number of payments being made by Wells, authorising the transfer of funds into four separate bank accounts not known to the charity, police said. 
Three of the accounts belonged to Wells but she also used a friend's husband, Francis Jones, to launder some of the money through his mobile sandwich bar, the force said. 
Invoices to the value of £42,800 were paid to Jones' Butty Bar between January 2018 and September 2019.
Jones, 40, from Runcorn, admitted converting criminal property after the money was paid into his business by Wells.
He then paid £28,100 of this back to Wells' accounts, police said.
Jones was sentenced in December 2022 to 15 months in prison, which was suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work.
The force said intelligence led police to believe Wells had fled to Turkey and she was detained on 18 August with the help of Turkish authorities.
Wells appeared at Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday where she was handed another four weeks for breaching bail.
Det Con Daryl Gavin said: ""Not only did Wells fraudulently take a large amount of money, this money belonged to a charity committed to helping people in need.
""Instead of facing the consequences of her actions, Wells attempted to evade police before she could appear in court to be sentenced.
""As this case demonstrates, if you have committed crime in Cheshire, there really is nowhere to hide.""

Brics summit: Is a new bloc emerging to rival US leadership?,"The announced expansion of the five-nation Brics club of emerging economies was described as ""historic"" by Chinese President Xi Jinping, but it is still not clear how far the countries' common interests stretch.
The growth of Brics ""will… further strengthen the force for world peace and development"" the president said while addressing the leaders gathered at a conference centre in South Africa's commercial hub, Johannesburg.
The Brics countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - are often seen as a counterweight to the Western-led world. 
The six new countries - Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - are set to join in January.
China was the state pushing hardest for group expansion as a way to counter Western dominance. 
Steve Tsang, director of London's Soas China Institute, says though the Brics members do not have much in common on the surface, President Xi was trying to show his fellow bloc members that they all want a similar future: none of them want to live in a Western-dominated world.
""What the Chinese are offering is an alternative world order for which autocrats can feel safe and secure in their own countries,"" says Prof Tsang.
""They can find an alternative direction of development without having to accept the conditionalities imposed by the democratic Americans and European powers.""
The host, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, beamed as he made the announcement about the new joiners. 
""We value the interest of other countries in building a partnership with Brics,"" Mr Ramaphosa said.  
He went on to say that more countries will join in the future after the core nations agree on criteria for membership.
But there were divisions this time on how many countries should be allowed to join and how quickly.
A leaders' press conference was scheduled for Wednesday after rumours were swirling about five countries being added to the bloc, but it was cancelled at the last minute. 
Then Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva was a no-show to Wednesday's leadership dinner.  
We do not know why exactly, but he is very conscious about maintaining ties with his Western allies, and was picky about admittance.  
Then late Wednesday night, journalists received an advisory for an early morning press conference, just for it to be delayed again by two hours. These were signs that discussions were under way until the very last minute, as there was a surprise sixth country added. 
At the press event, the leaders from each country were then able to give individual reactions to the news. 
Russian President Vladmir Putin joined by video link from Russia because of the danger of being arrested over alleged war crimes in Ukraine. 
In his remarks, he once again took aim at Western powers, saying their ""neo-liberalism"" posed a threat to both traditional values in developing countries and to the emergence of a multi-polar world where no one country or bloc dominated.
Without naming names, it was clear who President Putin was speaking about: the United States. 
And though the super-power was not at the meeting, the US was talked about, or referenced, quite a bit. 
On Tuesday, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan attempted to play down the bloc's expansion plans. 
He said that due to Brics countries' divergence of views on critical issues, he did not see it as ""evolving into some kind of geo-political rival to the United States or anyone else"".
And he may be right. 
Of the six new members, none are seen as anti-American states, according to Sarang Shidore, director of the Global South programme at the Quincy Institute in Washington. 
""I think the message is that this is a diverse set of countries, none of them are close US allies, formal allies, two or three of them will be US opponents. But more broadly, this is not a group of anti-American states,"" he told the BBC. 
Nevertheless, the Brics expansion does represent a shift.
""No longer is it a world where the US can set all the norms, or drive all the institutions. There's no question about that.  But a replacement? No, I would say much more of a complementarity than a replacement that is on the horizon,"" Mr Shidore added.
So for a group that says they all value and respect each other's opinions, maybe no-one won or lost. It really was just a diplomatic gathering with some give and take. 
Mr Putin was not arrested, and thanks to modern day technology, Russia was still represented. 
China got its big plan for membership expansion.  
Brazil's push for a common currency is being taken seriously. 
India was seen as trying to balance its friendship with America. 
And South Africa, hosted a successful meeting with no public fallouts.

Zimbabwe election: Poll monitors arrested amid election,"Police in Zimbabwe have arrested 41 election monitors for allegedly trying to disrupt the voting process.
Those being held, from civil society groups, were allegedly co-ordinating the release of results from Wednesday's general election, police say.
They are being charged with breaking electoral law, their lawyers say.
Civil society groups have tried to do their own vote count to compare results with the official tally in light of disputes over past election results.
The 41 are being accused of attempting to announce results before the state elections body - who by law are the only ones who can declare a winner. 
Previously the state elections body chairperson Priscilla Chigumba had urged civil society groups to set up their own parallel tabulation processes to encourage transparency and scrutiny 
Officers carried out a series of raids and arrests in the capital, Harare, including at a hotel and offices of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network and the Election Resource Centre, where the 41 worked.
Initially, lawyers said they had received disturbing distress calls from clients, adding that they did not know where the police had taken them. But they were later granted access to their clients.
Police spokesman Paul Nyathi has said that 38 laptop computers and 93 phones were seized from the offices. He added that ""any form of chaos"" during the election would be ""severely"" dealt with.
A statement from the police explained why the devices were confiscated: ""The equipment was being used to unlawfully tabulate election voting statistics and results from polling stations throughout the country.""
The arrests have been strongly condemned by NGOs who said it was a ""ploy by the state to target civil society organisations and ultimately silence their voice on the 2023 elections"".
The Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition also called for the unconditional release of the detained poll monitors.
On Wednesday, Zimbabweans went to the polls to elect a president, members of parliament and local councillors.
The arrests came as voting was extended to a second day in three provinces of the country due to delays on Wednesday.
In Harare, only a quarter of polling stations opened on time because of problems with ballot papers. In some areas, ballot papers ran out, forcing voters to wait late into the night.
The electoral commission blamed last-minute court challenges for the late arrival of council election ballot papers.
Meanwhile, leader of the main opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Nelson Chamisa accused the authorities of ""voter suppression"".
Vote counting is under way and election officials have five days to declare the results of the presidential election.
In 2018, Mr Chamisa was unsuccessful in his legal bid to overturn the results from that year's election, which he described as a ""coup against [the people's] will"".
Official results showed that he took a 44% share of the vote in the presidential election - the incumbent, Emmerson Mnangagwa, won with 51%.
This week's vote was the second time the two men have faced each other in a race for the top job.

Sara Sharif murder probe: Fresh appeal two weeks after girl found dead,"Police have launched a fresh appeal for information two weeks after a 10-year-old girl was found dead at her home.
Sara Sharif's body was found alone at a house in Woking, Surrey, a day after her family members flew to Pakistan.
Detectives launched an international manhunt and have now appealed to ""people in the Woking community and beyond"" who had contact with Sara who have not previously come forward.
Police said they were working to piece together a picture of Sara's lifestyle.
Det Supt Mark Chapman thanked people who had already contacted officers, but said: ""We know that there will be lots of people in the Woking community and beyond who will have had contact with Sara who may not already have come forward, and we would encourage them to do so.
""Any information is better than no information.
""Although you might think it's insignificant, it might be vital to the investigation and in helping us to bring justice for Sara.""
An inquest is due to be opened on Tuesday at Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking.
Sara's body was discovered at her home in Hammond Road, Horsell, in the early hours of 10 August.
Officers are working with the authorities in Pakistan to locate Sara's father Urfan Sharif, his partner Beinash Batool and his brother Faisal Malik, who were believed to have travelled to Islamabad.
But a court in Pakistan has said Mr Sharif's relatives in the country cannot be detained by police for questioning on his whereabouts.
It comes after Mr Sharif's family said police had illegally detained two of his brothers who live in Pakistan.
Surrey Police said it had ""widened the timescale"" of the murder investigation after finding Sara had suffered injuries over an extended period of time.
Post-mortem tests found Sara had sustained ""multiple and extensive injuries"".
Det Supt Chapman said the impact of Sara's death continued to be felt deeply by the local and wider community, including among officers and staff.
Surrey Police have also released an image of Mr Malik as part of the renewed appeal.
Sara's head teachers and neighbours have paid tribute to the Year 5 pupil who had attended St Mary's C of E primary school in Byfleet.
However, those who knew Sara have described how she had been home-schooled since April.
One mother has revealed her daughter saw Sara with cuts and bruises at school but when her daughter asked Sara what had happened, she said she had fallen off her bike.
Surrey County Council have confirmed she was known to the authorities and police have also revealed the force had ""historic"" contact with the family.

Ukraine claims Crimea landing for 'special operation' on Independence Day,"Ukraine has claimed its troops briefly landed overnight in the occupied Crimea peninsula, as the country marks 32 years of its independence. 
All objectives of the ""special operation"" were achieved without any casualties, the defence ministry said.
It added that during a firefight in Olenivka and Mayak, western Crimea, ""the enemy suffered losses"". 
Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, eight years before Moscow launched a full-scale invasion.
The Kremlin has so far made no public comments on the reported Ukrainian operation. 
In a post on Telegram, the main intelligence department of Ukraine's defence ministry claimed responsibility for Thursday's operation. It said the Ukrainian Navy provided the support. 
It said that ""special units on watercraft landed on the shore"" before engaging in combat with Russian troops stationed in the area.
""Also, the state flag was flying again in the Ukrainian Crimea,"" the statement added.
The intelligence department posted a short video purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers raising the national flag. Gunfire sounds can be heard in the footage. 
Ukraine's Suspilne television channel reported that the skirmish involved aircraft and navy ships. A Russian Telegram channel had also reported of fighting in that area.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released an Independence Day message on X, formerly known as Twitter, rallying his countrymen to help maintain the country's independence. 
""In this fight, everyone counts. Because the fight is for something that is important to everyone,"" Mr Zelensky said.
Independence Day has gained increased significance among Ukrainians since Russia's full-scale invasion started in February 2022, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. It is now the country's third most important holiday, behind only Easter and Christmas.
Ukraine launched its counter-offensive in June, attempting to expel the Russians from land they had captured in the east and south of the country.
An analysis by BBC Verify showed the gains in terms of reclaimed land size have been small.
However, analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) say the advances near Robotyne and Urozhaine are ""likely tactically significant because of the structure of Russian defensive lines"". They also note that Russian forces have dedicated significant effort to hold the settlements.
Russia has also accused Ukraine of drone attacks, the most recent of which was on 23 August. It hit a skyscraper under construction in Moscow.
Ukraine's claim of landing its troops in Crimea came a day after it emerged that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the mercenary group that fought with Russia in the war, was on the passenger list of a private jet that crashed after taking off from Moscow. 
Mr Prigozhin had led a failed mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.

Who is Dmitry Utkin and who else was on the plane?,"Nine other people were on the plane alongside Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin when it crashed, according to flight details released by the Russian aviation authorities.
They include Dmitry Utkin, who is believed to have given the mercenary group its name.
Russia also says Valery Chekalov, who is believed to have been crucial to the group's finances, was on board.
Three crew members were on the flight alongside the Wagner members.
Here's what we know about them.
The history of the Wagner Group is murky but follow the trail back far enough and Dmitry Utkin's name will inevitably crop up.
The 53-year-old veteran of Russia's two wars in Chechnya in 1994-2000 is believed to have been involved in the private army since its early days in 2014.
The group itself is named after his call sign Wagner. It is seemingly a reference to composer Richard Wagner, who was Adolf Hitler's favourite composer.
In recent years, Utkin is reported to have been Prigozhin's right-hand man, responsible for overall command and combat training.
There are few photographs of Utkin but one of those in circulation is a selfie which reveals neo-Nazi tattoos on his body.
According to Utkin's online CV, which appears to be from around 2013 and was unearthed by the investigative website Bellingcat, he served in the GRU - Russia's military intelligence division - from 1988 to 2008. It says his involvement in combat operations led to government awards, and lists weapons skills among his professional qualities. 
Utkin became a gun for hire after leaving military intelligence and gained influence in Wagner when the group fought on the side of pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014. 
He is also thought to have been involved in the group's operations in Syria and Africa. A BBC investigation in 2021 linked him to documents which exposed Wagner's involvement in the Libyan civil war.
A picture thought to be taken in 2016 shows Utkin alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin at a Kremlin reception, at a time when the Russian government was denying links to Wagner. 
Mr Putin has since said the Russian government funded the group to the tune of billions of dollars.

Watch: Video shows plane crash in the Tver region
Chekalov is believed to be a close Prigozhin associate with business links to the Wagner leader stretching back to the 2000s.
The 47-year-old appears to have been involved in running Prigozhin's non-military business interests, which Western governments say are used to finance the mercenary group.
Chekalov was linked with Evro Polis, a company associated with Prigozhin, which signed contracts for the production of gas and oil in Syria in 2017.
According to the US Treasury, the company was contracted by President Bashar al-Assad's government ""to protect Syrian oil fields in exchange for a 25% share in oil and gas production from the fields"".
The finances raised from the deal were used to pay Wagner fighters and procure arms, the US Treasury said.
Chekalov is also believed to have been in charge of Wagner's business projects across Africa.
He had been targeted by US and Ukrainian sanctions over his links with Prigozhin, and Evro Polis has also been sanctioned by a number of governments, including the UK.
The other four men listed as passengers all appear to be Wagner fighters. 
Unlike Utkin and Chekalov, they do not appear on international sanctions lists and so have not been deemed to be senior figures by Western governments.
Given that we know Prigozhin was surrounded by close protection - and even more so after his rift with Vladimir Putin deepened - they may have been travelling as bodyguards.
The names of three of the men appear in a database of alleged Wagner fighters which has been compiled by pro-Ukrainian activists: Yevgeny Makaryan, Sergei Propustin and Alexander Totmin.
Another man identified by the Russian authorities as Nikolai Matuseyev does not appear in the database.
One Russian Telegram channel says it could have been Nikolai Matusevich, a member of Wagner's assault unit. 
The remaining three people identified as being among the dead by Russian authorities are the pilot Alexei Levshin, co-pilot Rustam Karimov and Kristina Raspopova, a flight attendant and the only woman on board.
Very little confirmed information is available on the trio and it is unclear if they were directly employed by Prigozhin, by a company he owned, or by another firm entirely.
Prigozhin is known to have regularly travelled by private jet, and the aircraft involved in the crash, a Brazilian-made Embraer Legacy 600, is known to have been used by him previously.
The plane was put under US sanctions in 2019 - when it was listed under a different registration - because of its links to Prigozhin via a company, Reuters reported.
The BBC has not independently verified details about the flight crew but reports citing interviews with their relatives are circulating in Russian online media.
Raspopova, 39, is said to have spoken to her family and posted photographs on social media shortly before the flight took off.
Karimov, 29, had only worked for the company for three months, according to a Russian media interview with his father, and reportedly celebrated his fourth wedding anniversary earlier this month.
Levshin, 51, was married with two children and had worked in aviation his entire adult life, Russian outlets reported quoting his family.

Stoke-on-Trent Ukrainian student passes GCSEs in four months,"A Ukrainian student who started school four months before her GCSEs says she is ""really proud"" after passing them.
Halyna, 16, left war-torn Kyiv just over a year ago after her step-father got a job in Stoke-on-Trent.
The Thistley Hough Academy pupil said adapting to an English school was ""terrifying"" but she had got the marks she needed for college.
She added she was looking forward to telling her mum and hoped she would be proud of her.
Halyna's family were stranded in Ukraine awaiting their UK visas when Russia invaded in 2022.
""The first day, the whole 24 hours we [spent] in the bomb shelter because we were really scared to leave,"" she said.
They fled to Poland, where a relative helped them travel to Warsaw, then on to Romania where they lived for three months before returning home to collect their visas.
Starting school shortly before Christmas, Halyna said new friends helped her find her feet.
""At first it was really terrifying,"" she said. ""The studying system is obviously a bit harder here. English is my third language so it's even harder.
""The exam board was asking for [a] really, really high level of English and I really felt I was learning it all over again from zero.""
She plans to celebrate in a cafe with friends after obtaining 5 and 6 grades - roughly aligning with Cs and Bs respectively in the previous grading method. 
""I've done really well, I've got all the marks I needed to. I passed the exam and I got into [the] course I wanted to go to in college,"" she said.
Nationally, GCSE pass rates have fallen for a second year running - with 68.2% of all grades marked at grades 4/C and above - in an attempt to return grades to pre-pandemic levels.

Syria: Protests over growing economic hardship spread in south,"Protests against Syria's government are intensifying in the country's south, amid widespread anger over its decision to cut fuel subsidies when millions of people are already struggling to afford basic goods because of hyperinflation. 
A large banner showing President Bashar al-Assad hanging in one of the main squares in the city of Suweida is seen being set on fire in one video shared on social media over the past week.
""We want everyone to come out to the streets across Syria,"" says a man in another clip. ""We are here against poverty and humiliation, calling for our rights. Everyone should be out protesting."" 
Crowds have even been filmed calling for the fall of the president, with chants such as ""Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad"" echoing those of 2011 pro-democracy uprising that descended into civil war. 
Government-held Suweida has witnessed protests against Mr Assad over the past 12 years, but this is the first time that such slogans have been heard on its streets.
His regime has long been careful in its dealings with the minority Druze sect whose followers make up most of the residents of the city and its surrounding province. It has tolerated dissent there to a larger degree than it would in other areas under its control.
Some protesters have also been taking place in neighbouring Deraa province, where the 2011 uprising began but which was retaken by the government seven years later.
Deteriorating living conditions have pushed many people to take to the streets in recent months.
But the protests intensified last week, after the government announced the total lifting of subsidies on petrol and a partial lifting of subsidies on fuel oil.
A worsening economic crisis, with a currency collapse fuelling hyperinflation, has left almost 90% of the population living below the poverty line. But the sudden spike in fuel prices has made the situation even worse.
Some public sector workers' monthly income is worth as little as $20 (£15.80) at the black market exchange rate. That has left them unable to afford even essential food supplies for their families.
Earlier in the month, a new group calling itself ""The 10th of August Movement"" issued a statement calling for living conditions to be improved in Syria. Many of those behind the group are believed to be from Mr Assad's minority Alawite sect, which has steadfastly supported him during the war. 
The statement demanded the government raise the monthly minimum wage so that it was worth at least $100; provide electricity for at least 20 hours a day, up from the current average of three in most areas; and issue new passports within a month, signalling the desire of many young people to leave the country. The statement also called for the release of political prisoners.
In recent days, photos of people in various cities across Syria with letters making similar demands and expressing opposition to Mr Assad's rule have posted on social media.
Exiled opposition groups hope that these developments will lead to lead to long awaited changes, but the president's hold on power appears to be secure for now.
The criticism from his fellow Alawites will, however, be a cause for concern for Mr Assad.
Some are reported to have been arrested after they took to social media platforms to call on the president to act.
Ahmed Ibrahim Ismail is one of them. He is from Jableh, a town in the north-western coastal province of Latakia that is the heartland of the Alawites.
Mr Ismail publicly criticised the president following a TV interview two weeks ago.
""I wished to hear something else from you... You are flying away from reality. I am very disappointed. I haven't anything from you to tackle my pain,"" he said.
He went on to describe his deteriorating living conditions. 
A few days later, Mr Ismail's daughter announced on her Facebook that he had been detained.
Many similar stories have been circulating online.  
During the past 12 years of protests and war, many have argued that Mr Assad would be able to stay in power unless the Alawite community turned against him.
So far, there is no evidence of a strong organised movement that could threaten his rule, but the growing public anger - especially among Alawites - could be the start of something bigger.

Sara Sharif: Court rules girl's Pakistan family cannot be detained,"Relatives of the father of Sara Sharif, whose death in the UK sparked an international manhunt, cannot be detained in Pakistan by police for questioning on his whereabouts.
The decision was made at the Lahore high court, Rawalpindi bench.
The body of Sara, 10, was found at her family home in Woking, Surrey, on 10 August, prompting a murder inquiry.
Her father Urfan Sharif, 41, travelled to Pakistan with his partner and one of his brothers before her body was found.
Mr Sharif's family said police had illegally detained two of his brothers who live in Pakistan.
At the Lahore high court, Rawalpindi bench, Jhelum Police officers did not deny they had held the two men for several days but said they had not arrested them. 
They told the court they had been instructed by Interpol to question the family about Mr Sharif's location. Both brothers have been released.
The court barred the police from detaining them again but officers said they would continue to question them.
While Pakistan and the UK do not have a formal extradition treaty, Surrey Police officers are working with the authorities in Pakistan to locate Mr Sharif, his partner Beinash Batool, 29, and his brother Faisal Malik, 28.
The force has made a fresh appeal for information two weeks after launching its murder investigation following the discovery of Sara's body alone in the family home at 02:50 BST on 10 August.
Detectives urged ""people in the Woking community and beyond"" who had contact with Sara to come forward.
Surrey Police said previously Mr Sharif, 41, made a 999 call from Pakistan shortly after landing in Islamabad with Ms Batool, Mr Malik and five children, aged between one and 13.
That led officers to the house in Woking where they found Sara's body. She had sustained ""multiple and extensive injuries"" likely to have been caused over a sustained period of time.
A post-mortem examination failed to establish the exact cause of Sara's death, with more tests being carried out.
Det Supt Mark Chapman of Surrey Police also said the force has had ""historic"" contact with her family that ""goes back some years"".
Speaking to the BBC outside the court in Pakistan, Mr Sharif's father and one brother repeated their assertion that they were not in touch with him and did not know where he was. 
They told the police they believe he came to the city of Jhelum, where the family is from, but then left.
Jhelum Police said it still does not know where Mr Sharif, his partner Ms Batool and his brother Mr Malik are.

Poole teenager crowned First Daughter aims to inspire girls,"A teenager who was crowned First Daughter of the Igbo community at a yam festival has said she wants to inspire girls to engage with the community.
Stephanie Ogbuji, 16, was appointed at the New Yam Festival in Poole, Dorset in 2022.
She is the first to hold the honour in the UK, and attended this year's festival at the weekend.
The festival is an annual event celebrated by the Igbo tribe of Nigeria and their diaspora.
It celebrates the beginning of the harvest and eating of new yam. 
Stephanie said: ""The first daughter holds the highest responsibility in the family in Nigeria.""
As part of the 2022 festival, contestants for the First Daughter crown had to show a talent, and make a speech about what they could bring to the community.
Organisers hope the competition will become an ongoing tradition, with a new First Daughter appointed at the festival every two years.
Speaking at this year's event Stephanie said: ""It was a programme that was started to bring confidence to young women in our community.
""The title is the first in the UK - we are hoping we can inspire other communities around England to create such a competition so we can have a history of first daughters in the community."" 
As part of her title, Stephanie received £300 which she is saving for university where she hopes to study medicine.
She said: ""I didn't have an idea of what it means to be really united in the community. It felt amazing to be noticed and recognised by everyone.""
Over the past year, Stephanie has been giving speeches at local events about female empowerment, and in her second year as First Daughter she is raising money to sponsor a girl to go to theatre school for six months. 
""So far we have raised £300,"" she added.
The next First Daughter competition is due to take place at the New Yam Festival in August 2024.

Somalia TikTok: Government's planned ban leaves creators anxious,"Somalia's ban on TikTok, which is set to take effect on Thursday evening, has outraged many users who make a living off the app.
The self-proclaimed ""president of Somali TikTokers"" is nervous about his financial future.
Bilaal Bulshaawi, one of the prominent faces on Somali social media, says the app has totally transformed his life.
""Before, there were many times when I couldn't afford to pay for a tuk-tuk ride but now I drive a car and enjoy my luxury lifestyle. I travel to different Somali regions for tourism,"" Bilaal told the BBC.
He started using the platform when he was an 18-year-old high school student making short comedy videos with his classmates.  But the popularity of his films snowballed and they have now become his main source of income.
Bilaal makes money by advertising businesses on his account, which has 1.3 million followers. The adverts generate between $500 (£400) and $1000 a week. He uses the money to pay rent, buy food and also to pay his mother's bills.  
""My mother was able to stop working,"" Bilaal added, ""she raised me while working as a nurse and when I started my social media I let her rest.""
Using a Somali expression he says the government ban will hit them both hard. 
""The fire will go out in our kitchens,"" he says.
But the government seems determined to go ahead with the plan to prevent access to TikTok along with Telegram and gambling app 1XBet.
It argues that these platforms are being used by ""terrorists and groups responsible for spreading immorality"".
The announced ban comes as the authorities seek to crush the al-Shabab militant group, which still controls large swathes of the country.
Hafsa Hilkas is another creator who is now feeling anxious.
She started using TikTok a year ago and she shares comedy sketches, pranks and entertainment videos on her account. Within three months she had more than half a million followers and then started her own online business on the app selling perfumes. 
""I receive so many orders from all the Somali regions,"" she said.
The 19-year-old's success has enabled her to become financially independent and move out of her family home. 
She now fears that she will lose her independence the moment the government's order is implemented. 
In a conservative country like Somalia, it is not that easy for a young woman to get a job partly due to sexism. Hafsa told the BBC that even her family was not happy about her moving out and working. 
""My family told me to get married.  My parents said, 'you are a girl, you don't need to go out and work'"", she added, ""but I want to work and be an independent woman."" 
Bilaal and Hafsa both said they had no other option but do similar work on other social media platforms but it will take time to attract followers there and the ban will be painful.    
""It is like owning a shop in big market which then burns down. So, it will take time to recover from that damage,"" said Bilaal. 
Over the past few years TikTok has become the most popular social media platform in Somalia and the diaspora. 
Many people use it as a source of entertainment - but not everyone thinks the announced ban is a bad idea.   
Student Samira Mohamed confesses that she spends many hours on TikTok but she thinks that some of the content disgraces the dignity of Somali girls. This is because the platform has been used to advertise sexually explicit content which is then available to watch via Telegram. 
There is also the issue of people blackmailing others by posting embarrassing or compromising videos of them.  
""It is all about shaming people. It is damaging people's values and more and more girls are removing their hijabs,"" she said. 
Contrary to Samira's idea, TikTok user Sakariye Mohamed believes that the app gives young people opportunities after the government failed to create a peaceful environment for them to find employment.   
""It's a source of income for both educated and non-educated youngsters. It also diverted young people from the pain of unemployment,"" Sakariye said.

Employment figure hits record high in Republic of Ireland,"At a glance
The employment rate in the Republic of Ireland has reached a record high
The rate measures the percentage of people aged 15-64 who are in work
Ireland’s economy has recovered strongly since the pandemic
The employment rate in the Republic of Ireland reached a record high of 74.2% in the second quarter of this year.
The rate measures the percentage of people aged 15-64 who are in work.
Male employment was 78%, below the record level of 80.6% which was reached during the 'Celtic Tiger' boom in 2007.
Female employment reached a new record of 70.5%. 
The female employment rate in Ireland when first recorded in 1998 was just over 50%. , external
In recent months there have been some jobs losses at US technology firms in Dublin, such as Meta, as those firms cut staff across their global operations.
However those losses have been modest in the context of the overall jobs market.
Ireland’s economy has recovered strongly since the pandemic. 
Earlier this week, the ESRI think tank estimated that the domestic economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4% in the second quarter of the year.
Despite the strong economic performance the governing coalition is struggling in the polls as high housing costs mean many people feel they are not sharing in the country’s prosperity.

Nîmes shootings: Two killings in three days in small French city,"An 18-year-old has been shot dead in the southern French city of Nîmes, days after a boy aged 10 was killed by gunfire in an attack linked to the drugs trade.
Both shootings took place in the Pissevin area of the city which has become plagued by drug violence.
The first victim, called Fayed, was fatally shot on Monday night while he was in a car with his uncle.
In the latest attack. the teenage victim was ambushed a few streets away.
Local prosecutor Cécile Gensac said it was the 10-year-old's misfortune to be ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" shortly before midnight on Monday.
Fayed was shot just 100m from his home in Pissevin. His family had no connection with drug gangs and had never had any brush with authority, the prosecutor said.
Police believe the uncle's Renault Clio car had been wrongly linked by the killers to another shooting and Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin spoke of a ""tit-for-tat attack between drug dealers"".
Nîmes Mayor Jean-Paul Fournier said he was saddened and revolted by the boy's death and police sent an elite CRS8 team to beef up security. 
The CR8 have already been deployed 100km (60 miles) to the south in Marseille, where drug turf wars have claimed a dozen lives in little more than a month. 
Two rival gangs, Yoda and DZ Mafia, are said to be behind most of the shootings in northern areas of the Mediterranean port city, particularly in the high-rise district of La Paternelle.
Smaller regional cities such as Nîmes are now becoming caught up in the drugs war. 
Despite the deployment of about 20 elite police, the second shooting there this week took place in the early hours of Thursday. Authorities said it unfolded during a drug deal and the 18-year-old victim was known to police. 
The local prosecutor said bullet casings were found at the scene and the murder was being linked to organised crime. 
French reports said the teenager had been carrying a satchel containing €5 and €10 notes when his attackers opened fire, apparently with a assault-type rifle and a handgun. 
A young student tried in vain to resuscitate him. The satchel with the cash was found by his side.

Fukushima: Sushi lovers grab last bites as seafood ban hits Japan,"""I'll keep eating Japanese seafood... It's just that addictive,"" said Hong Kong diner Mr Ho while standing outside a Japanese seafood restaurant.
He was among a number of Hongkongers who had been flocking to Japanese eateries for their fill of sushi and sashimi in recent weeks.
Japanese seafood has always been very popular in the city. But there has been a renewed urgency to consume it in the days leading up to the Fukushima nuclear waste water release. 
On Thursday, Japanese authorities announced at 13:00 local time (05:00 BST) that they had begun pumping the water into the ocean through an underground tunnel. It prompted an immediate outcry from regional neighbours. 
Soon after, mainland China's customs office announced that an existing ban on seafood imports from Fukushima and some prefectures would be immediately extended to cover the whole of Japan to ""protect the health of Chinese consumers"".
Many expect Hong Kong to follow suit in the coming days.
This would be a massive hit to Japan. China and Hong Kong account for nearly half of all Japan's seafood exports - amounting to $1.1bn (£866m) every year.
Chinese social media has been flooded with posts from users expressing concern about the release of waste water, with some worrying about its long-term effects on fish that finds it way to restaurants around the world.
""This isn't just a question of whether seafood is safe to eat. The circulation of currents means this will affect the whole world,"" read one comment on social media site Weibo.
China's state-backed Global Times published a cartoon depicting the planet as a human head being poisoned by brown water from Japan. The Japanese flag and the name of Fukushima plant operator Tepco featured prominently in the image.
One Weibo poll seeking public reactions to Japan's move offered three suggested replies - all against the release of the water.
But Japan has been bracing itself for the backlash.
The government said in 2021 that it will buy marine products to support fishermen as an ""emergency step"" if the planned discharge has a negative impact on sales, The Japan Times reported.
The report also said authorities were considering setting up a fund that can be ""used flexibly to buy seafood from Fukushima and other parts of Japan"".
Whether officials anticipated a total ban is unclear at this point.

The curbs from China come despite experts saying that the release will not make the sea more radioactive than it already is.
It was signed off by the UN's nuclear watchdog in July, with authorities concluding the impact on people and the environment would be negligible. 
Many scientists say the concerns about the effects of treated water on seafood has ""no basis in scientific evidence"".
Prof Jim Smith, who teaches environmental science at the University of Portsmouth, says radiation doses to people will be ""vanishingly small"" if the discharge is carried out as planned. 
The exposure would be ""more than a thousand times less"" than doses we get from natural radiation each year, Prof Smith says.
Mark Foreman, an associate professor of nuclear chemistry in Sweden, said people who consume a lot of seafood will only be exposed to ""low"" doses of radiation - in the range of 0.0062 to 0.032 microSv per year.
Humans can safely be exposed to tens of thousands of times more than that - or up to 1,000 microSv of radiation per year.
But some fears remain. 
Back in Hong Kong, another diner who only wanted to be known as Ms Cheng said she was worried about the potential health impact of eating Japanese seafood.
Eating at Japanese restaurants has been a weekly ritual for her. But she now plans to cut back on this habit and observe the situation for the next six months, and will switch to Norwegian or South Korean seafood for now.
But a third diner who spoke to the BBC, Ah Yum said she did not think the release would change her fondness for Japanese cuisine. It's a 9.5 out of 10, she said.
""You like it, you eat it. There's nothing you could do about it,"" she said.

Vivek Ramaswamy: Five things the Republican presidential candidate believes,"This video can not be played
Ramaswamy: 'I was clearly the winner of this thing'
Vivek Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old biotech multi-millionaire running for president, was a standout performer in the first debate between Republican candidates for the party's nomination.
With no previous experience of political office, he has positioned himself as an outsider willing to develop former President Donald Trump's ""America First"" agenda with his own personal spin.
That includes some unconventional proposals on everything from law enforcement to the war in Ukraine. Here are five things he believes.
Mr Ramaswamy has voiced support for raising the voting age to 25. 
But under his proposal, those over 18 would be able to vote if they meet a ""national service requirement"", either by being an emergency first responder or by serving for at least six months in the military.
""We must think ambitiously about reviving civic duty in America,"" he said earlier this year.
He suggested that those over 18 would also be able to vote if they pass the same test given to those seeking US citizenship.
""I understand not everyone will like this proposal and that it will take persuasion to convince many of its merits, but I'm ready to take that on,"" he said.
Raising the voting age would require changing the US Constitution, meaning, among other things, that two-thirds of Congress would need to approve the measure.
In a departure from most Western sentiment on the war, Mr Ramaswamy has called for Ukraine to make ""major concessions"" in order to end the conflict.
""What I think we need to do is end the Ukraine war on peaceful terms that, yes, do make some major concessions to Russia, including freezing those current lines of control in a Korean-war style armistice agreement,"" he told ABC News in June.
He believes the ""number one threat to the US military"" is the Chinese-Russian alliance, and so called for ""a permanent commitment not to allow Ukraine to enter Nato. But in return, Russia has to leave its treaty and its joint military agreement with China"".
Mr Ramaswamy opposes sending aid to Kyiv and instead believes the president should focus on American interests.
""I think that by fighting further in Russia, by further arming Ukraine, we are driving Russia into China's hands."" he said.
Mr Ramaswamy does not support a federal ban on abortion because, in his words, ""the federal government should stay out of it"".
He has supported six-week bans on the procedure at state level, however, and described himself as ""unapologetically pro-life"".
""If murder laws are handled at the state level, and abortion is a form of murder, the pro-life view, then it makes no sense for that to be the one federal law,"" he told CNN.
Mr Ramaswamy has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.
""In many cases, these agencies are redundant relative to functions that are already performed elsewhere in the federal government,"" he told NBC News.
He has proposed a reorganisation in which the FBI's funding would be distributed instead to the Secret Service, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Defense Intelligence Agency.
Former President Donald Trump, the current frontrunner to win the Republican nomination, has repeatedly attacked the FBI as being part of a ""witch hunt"" against him.
And a Fox News poll in June showed public confidence in America's top law enforcement agency had eroded from 80% in 2017 to 59%, mostly among Republicans.
Mr Ramaswamy has been widely criticised for remarks he made about the 9/11 attacks in an interview with The Atlantic magazine.
""It is legitimate to say how many police, how many federal agents, were on the planes that hit the Twin Towers,"" he said. 
""Maybe the answer is zero. It probably is zero for all I know, right? I have no reason to think it was anything other than zero,"" he continued. ""But if we're doing a comprehensive assessment of what happened... absolutely that should be an answer the public knows the answer to.""
An official bipartisan commission, in a final report published in 2004, established the events of 9/11 and found no evidence of a government plot.
Mr Ramaswamy later said he had been misquoted by the magazine, telling CNN: ""The truth is there are lies the government has told about 9/11. But it's not the ones that somebody put in my mouth.""
The Atlantic then published audio which showed his comments had been accurately transcribed.

Republican debate: What they said (and didn't say) about climate,"One of the most illuminating moments in the Republican debate came 20 minutes in. The reaction to it was swift and - among some young people and scientists - angry.
Did humans contribute to climate change? That was the question from the Fox News moderators to the eight presidential hopefuls on stage. 
After reading out some statistics from the deadly Hawaii wildfires, they played a clip from a member of the Young Americans for Freedom, a conservative youth activist organisation, who said climate was the number one issue for young people.
Asked to raise their hand if they thought mankind was to blame, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis interjected to say a show of hands was childish. Instead he laid into Joe Biden for the president's response to Hawaii. . 
Only one candidate said climate change was real in the short discussion that followed.
Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley went the furthest in agreeing with the question by saying: ""Is climate change real? Yes it is."" 
It was up to China and India to lower emissions, she said.
Cutting the US carbon footprint has been costly to the economy and put the country at a disadvantage globally, said Tim Scott. The South Carolina senator said bringing jobs ""home from China"" would help ease that pain and improve the environment.
One Republican candidate said the climate change agenda was a hoax. 
""The reality is that the anti-carbon agenda is the wet blanket on our economy,"" said Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech millionaire and the youngest candidate in the field. ""More people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change.""
Boos followed. But as he prefaced his remark by saying he was the only one on stage not ""bought and paid for"", it was unclear what the audience was responding to. 
Instead of answering the climate question, Chris Christie turned his fire on Mr Ramaswamy, calling him a ""guy who sounds like a ChatGPT"" and the discussion descended into chaos.
Donald Trump, who chose not to attend, has in the past minimised the threat of climate change by joking about oceans rising by one hundredth of an inch over 300 years. As president, he pulled out of the Paris climate accord.
The issue has become more talked about as extreme weather has caused havoc in the US. More than 100 people were killed on the Hawaiian island of Maui by wildfires and hundreds more remain missing, while California has been battered by its first tropical storm in 80 years. 
The American Conservation Coalition, which mobilises young people around environmental action, condemned what they heard on stage in Milwaukee. Challenging Mr Ramaswamy directly, they said: ""No, climate change is not a hoax. Candidates with this thinking are completely out of touch with young conservatives."" 
They then thanked Mrs Haley for being the only person on stage ""bold enough to tackle climate change head-on"".
The Sunrise Movement, a youth activist group which campaigns on climate change, said: ""Vivek calls climate change a hoax. We call bluff that he's been outside this summer.""
This year has already seen the hottest day ever recorded, the hottest month and - very likely - will also become the hottest year on record.
The science is clear-cut - the world's rising temperatures are the result of man-made climate change.
So it is perhaps not surprising that many climate scientists reacted with dismay at the opinions expressed during the Republican debate.  
Corinne Le Quere, professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia was unambiguous - humans are causing climate change.  
""This is not a political issue, it is a scientific fact that stems from overwhelming evidence from observed climate and from understanding the Earth's physical processes.""  
Professor Ed Hawkins, a climatologist at the University of Reading, agreed that whether humans are causing climate change is not a matter of belief. ""It is a scientific fact, endorsed by the climate science community, learned societies and every government around the world,"" he said. 
""How to respond to that fact is certainly a matter for political debate, and that is where the focus needs to be,"" he continued.
The climatologist Professor Michael E Mann of the University of Pennsylvania was more pungent. The Republican Party ""is not just a threat to the nation. It is a threat to the planet"", he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Meanwhile the meteorologist Eric Holthaus posted ""Climate denial is alive and well in the year 2023.""

Gas prices fall as fears over Australian strike recede,"Wholesale gas prices in Europe have fallen after a planned strike at Australia's largest liquefied natural gas plant looked to have been averted. 
The walkout at Woodside Energy's North West Shelf plant had threatened to disrupt global LNG supplies, driving up gas prices sharply. 
But on Thursday the firm reached an agreement in principle with unions, which it is hoped will halt the strike. 
Benchmark EU and UK gas prices are down almost 33% since their peak on Tuesday. 
Employee representatives at the North West Shelf plant said they were ""supportive of the in-principle agreement"" with Woodside Energy and would vote to ratify the deal on Thursday.  
""It's pleasing that Woodside has made our members a strong offer without industrial action being taken,"" union alliance spokesman Brad Gandy said.
Following the start of the war in Ukraine, Russia slashed supplies of natural gas to Europe, which led countries to seek out alternative sources of energy.
Many countries are relying on LNG to fill the gap, with Australia being one of world's largest exporters.
It has led to a gradual fall in global gas prices and energy bills, which soared in 2022. 
However, the prospect that workers at the North West Shelf plant might walk out on 2 September sparked fears that prices would start to rise again.
Last week, analysts at Cornwall Insight predicted the uncertainty would contribute to a rise in the price cap set by the UK's energy regulator - which limits what suppliers charge consumers per unit of energy - next year.
The cap means the typical annual household bill currently stands at £2,074, but October's cap, which will be announced on Friday, is forecast to fall slightly to £1,926. 
However, Cornwall forecast the cap would rise to £2,082.56 in January. The analyst says it will be issuing a fresh forecast on Friday.
Woodside said it would continue to work with the unions to finalise the agreement.
""Substantial progress was made at talks held on Wednesday and the parties have reached in-principle agreement on a number of issues that are key to the workforce,"" it added.
Workers at two other offshore LNG facilities in Australia, Gorgon and Wheatstone, operated by Chevron, voted to endorse possible strike action on Thursday.
Together with the North West Shelf site, the plants make up about 10% of the world's supply of LNG. 
However, energy analyst Saul Kavonic told Reuters that the risk of industrial action at Chevron's facilities was unlikely to significantly disrupt supplies.

Wagner defied Putin and now its leader Prigozhin may be dead,"This video can not be played
Watch: Yevgeny Prigozhin and the war in Ukraine
When Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner troops launched their insurrection two months ago, Vladimir Putin made his feelings more than clear. He called it ""treachery"" and a ""stab in the back"" of Russia. He promised that the perpetrators would be punished.
So there was incredulity in Russia when they were not. When a deal was cut between Mr Prigozhin and the Kremlin to end the mutiny; when all the charges against the Wagner founder and his fighters were dropped, despite the fact that Russian servicemen had been killed during the murky but brief insurrection. 
It made President Putin look weak. 
Commenting on the agreed compromise (ending the mutiny in exchange for immunity from prosecution) one Russian newspaper commented: ""This kind of compromise is normally made with political opponents. Never with criminals and terrorists. Does that mean we should view Mr Prigozhin now as a political figure?"" 
Suddenly things look rather different. 
Exactly two months on, Mr Prigozhin is presumed dead after his private jet crashed and exploded in a field. Wagner commander Dmitry Utkin was on the same jet.
The Russian elite will shed few tears over Mr Prigozhin's reported demise. That goes for Russia's military leadership, whom Mr Prigozhin had publicly and vocally condemned and whom he demanded be sacked. The Wagner boss claimed that the so-called ""March of Justice"" (his euphemism for the insurrection) had not targeted the Kremlin but had instead been directed at Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Chief of the General Staff, Valery Gerasimov.
In reality, the Wagner mutiny had been a direct challenge to President Putin's authority and a humiliating 24 hours for the Kremlin. Mr Putin himself pointed out that the Russian state had been financing Wagner. Money had clearly not bought loyalty.  
If this was an act of revenge by those in power, that sends two clear messages to Mr Prigozhin's loyalists and to anyone else in Russia who may have been contemplating armed resistance:
That means that President Putin could emerge from these dramatic events stronger domestically. 
But what if Mr Prigozhin becomes a martyr? What if those who had pledged loyalty to him - and who are well-trained fighters - call for their own acts of revenge? 
Grey Zone, a Telegram channel linked to Wagner, blamed Mr Prigozhin's reported death on ""Russian traitors"". 
It did not clarify who it believed those traitors were and what Wagner's response would be. 
If this crash was foul play, that will come as little surprise to many in Russia. Ever since the mutiny there has been feverish speculation about Mr Prigozhin's fate, about whether his actions really would be forgiven. 
He must have known that. Yet, in recent weeks, as he jetted around on his private plane he clearly did not view air travel as a danger. Perhaps he believed that he was too powerful, too crucial a figure in today's Russia to be taken out?

Fukushima: China retaliates as Japan releases treated nuclear water,"Japan has begun its controversial discharge of treated waste water from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean, sparking protests in the region and retaliation from Beijing.
China is the biggest buyer of seafood from Japan, and on Thursday it said it would block all such imports.
Japan says the water is safe, and many scientists agree. The UN's nuclear watchdog has also approved the plan.
But critics say more studies need to be done and the release should be halted.
More than a million tonnes of water stored at the nuclear plant will be discharged over the next 30 years.
China, which has been the most vocal of opponents since the plan was announced two years ago, called the water discharge an ""extremely selfish and irresponsible act"" and said Japan was ""passing an open wound onto the future generations of humanity"".
Shortly afterwards, China's customs office announced that an existing ban on seafood imports from Fukushima and some prefectures would be immediately extended to cover the whole of Japan to ""protect the health of Chinese consumers"".
The move is calculated to inflict economic damage, and Japan has admitted that businesses will take a ""significant"" hit. Mainland China and Hong Kong together import more than $1.1bn (£866m) of seafood from Japan every year - making up nearly half of Japan's seafood exports.
But analysts say that the reactions from China in particular, are as much motivated by politics as they are by genuine concerns. 
Tokyo's relationship to Beijing has deteriorated in recent years as it draws closer to the US and also shows support to Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by China.
""This incident is more of a symptom than a cause of worsening Sino-Japanese relations,"" said Chinese foreign policy expert Neil Thomas with the Asia Society Policy Institute. 
""Beijing may have made less of a fuss about the water release if its relationship with Tokyo was in a better place."" 
In return, Japan is likely to ""reject this criticism, but they are unlikely to do anything provocative,"" said James DJ Brown, a professor specialising in Japanese foreign policy at Temple University's Japan campus.
""While Japan's government is deeply concerned by what it sees as the aggressive actions of the Chinese Communist Party, they understand that it is in their interests to maintain stable relations with their larger neighbour.""
But it may not need to wait for long. Some observers believe that China may not stick with the ban.
""China's growing economic difficulties could mean that any ban is relatively brief and narrow, so as to limit the negative impact on Chinese importers and business sentiment,"" said Mr Thomas.
South Korea also has a longstanding ban on some Japanese seafood. But on Thursday its government had a more muted reaction. 
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said ""what is important now is whether Japan, as it promised to the international community, strictly follows the scientific standards and transparently provides information"".
Seoul and Tokyo have drawn closer despite deep historical grievances, united in their allyship to the US while facing down threats from North Korea and China. 
However, most South Koreans are opposed to the water's release, and on Thursday protesters in Seoul attempted to storm the Japanese embassy. Angry demonstrations were also held in Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Meanwhile Mark Brown, chair of the Pacific Islands Forum which had previously castigated the plan, said they now believe the plan ""meets international safety standards"". 
Since a tsunami destroyed the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, power plant company Tepco has been pumping in water to cool down the reactors' fuel rods. This means every day the plant produces contaminated water, which is treated and stored in massive tanks.
Even after treatment, the water contains unacceptably high levels of radioactive substances tritium and carbon-14 which are difficult to remove. Japan's solution is to dilute it with seawater before releasing it into the ocean.
More than 1,000 tanks have been filled, and Japan says this is not a sustainable long-term solution. It has argued that after treatment and dilution the water is safe to release.
Many scientists have backed the plan, saying it is sound. The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency has also said the plan complies with international standards and would have a ""negligible"" impact on the environment.
Authorities have promised to continuously monitor levels of radiation in the ocean and to maintain a high level of transparency. 
But there are some who are still sceptical given Tepco's track record - the company has in the past been blamed for a lack of transparency over the disaster, which it has apologised for. 
And while disposing treated water in the ocean is common practice for nuclear plants, critics have pointed out that the amount being released from Fukushima is on an unprecedented, far vaster scale.
Some scientists say more studies should be done on how it would affect the ocean bed and marine life. Environmental activist group Greenpeace has also called for the water to stay in the tanks until better processing technology is invented.
The plan has particularly angered coastal communities and fishermen in Japan. They fear it would harm their livelihoods as some worried consumers avoid seafood from the area, which has never fully recovered economically since the 2011 disaster.
The wider Japanese public also remains deeply divided on the issue, with only half supporting the water's discharge according to the latest polls.
""I think there should have been many other methods... instead of releasing it into the ocean,"" Tokyo protester Keiko Kisei told Reuters on Thursday.
""However, they chose to discharge the water and cause trouble to the world. It's absolutely unacceptable.""

Fresh appeal for hosts for Ukrainian refugees,"Katya Manokhina, 21, has been staying with host Jill Hanna in Leominster for the past four months
At a glance
To date, 716 people have been accommodated in Herefordshire through the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme
Support groups say more homes are needed to help those fleeing the war-torn country
Jill Hanna, who has so far hosted Ukrainians on three occasions, said she had found it ""really worthwhile""
A fresh appeal has been made for people in Herefordshire to host Ukrainian refugees.
So far, 716 Ukrainians fleeing the war-torn nation have been accommodated in the county through the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme, which offers guests a UK visa and housing with local residents.
While about 100 have now left Herefordshire, scheme organisers say hosts are needed for a fresh wave of arrivals as bombing in Ukraine continues.
Across the wider West Midlands, 7,220 Ukrainians have been sponsored and sheltered. 
Herefordshire, combined with neighbouring Malvern Hills, has taken in the most refugees per person than any other part of the region.
""My parents grew up with German Jewish refugees. When the war [in Ukraine] broke out, I applied [to help],"" said Jill Hanna, a host in Leominster.
""I thought that this was something I could do. There have been lots of high points.
""If you've got a spare bedroom, and maybe a spare bathroom helps too, it's really worthwhile.""
After first hosting a family-of-three last July, Ms Hanna is now on her third sponsorship, with 21-year-old student Katya Manokhina. 
Having spent a year in Herefordshire, Katya Manokhina is returning to Ukraine to study engineering in Kyiv
""I've had an amazing time with Jill,"" Ms Manokhina said. ""I now feel like England is my second home.""
This Sunday, she will return to Ukraine's capital Kyiv to start an engineering degree. 
""I want to help with the reconstruction of my own country,"" she said.
""I've spent the last year being in a safe place. I want to help my people.""
Sunday will also be the first time in nine months that Ms Manokhina has seen her mother.
But as she returns, help continues to be needed.
Diocese of Hereford coordinator Lesley Grady says the sponsorship scheme has been a big success in the county
""We desperately do need more hosts,"" said Lesley Grady, a coordinator for the Diocese of Hereford, which has been involved in supporting hosts and matching them with Ukrainian guests.
""The bombing has intensified in Ukraine, covering more of the west. So now, where people have escaped, they no longer feel safe there and need another safe haven.""

Malka Leifer: Israeli ex-principal jailed for sexually abusing Australian students,"An Israeli former principal will spend up to 15 years in jail for sexually assaulting two students at an ultra-Orthodox Jewish school in Australia.
Malka Leifer raped and indecently assaulted sisters Dassi Erlich and Elly Sapper between 2003 and 2007, a jury found in April.
The 56-year-old was found not guilty of abusing a third sister, Nicole Meyer. 
Leifer's sentencing ends a 15-year push for the mother-of-eight to face justice.
She had pleaded not guilty to more than two dozen charges and spent years fighting extradition from Israel. But in 2021, an Israeli judge found she had faked mental illness to avoid facing the courts and ordered she be sent to Melbourne.
During a lengthy trial, the jury heard evidence that Leifer had abused the sisters in locked classrooms, on school camps, and at the head teacher's home.
Detailing the 18 charges on Thursday, judge Mark Gamble called her offending ""insidious"".
Leifer was a revered figure at the Adass Israel School, awed almost like a rabbi, he said. And the sisters were starved of love and in need of protection - emotionally and physically abused at home by their mother and completely uneducated about sex. 
""This case is striking for just how vulnerable these victims were, and for the calculating way in which the offender, Mrs Leifer, took callous advantage... for her own perverse sexual gratification,"" the judge said.
Addressing ""powerful"" victim impact statements from Ms Sapper and Ms Erlich in which they spoke about lasting feelings of guilt, shame and fear, Judge Gamble stressed they were ""completely innocent"" of the ""predatory behaviour"" of Leifer.
""It is she and she alone who should feel guilty and ashamed for what occurred.""
Considering the time she has already served in prison, Leifer will be eligible for parole in June 2029.
Speaking alongside her sisters outside court, Ms Erlich said the sentence was the end of a long and traumatic chapter of their lives.
""We are here today because we did not give up,"" she said.
""And while we know that the onus of fighting for justice should not be up to survivors, this fight was never just for us.
""To any other survivors in this nightmare: you are never alone, we are all behind you.""
Now Leifer's trial has concluded, police have reopened an investigation into her attempts to evade justice.
The headteacher fled to Israel in 2008 after accusations were raised against her, reportedly with the help of members of the school board. She was arrested at Australia's request in 2014, but two years later an Israeli court suspended her extradition, ruling her to be mentally unfit for trial.
But undercover private investigators later filmed her shopping and depositing a cheque at a bank, leading Israeli authorities to investigate and re-arrest her in February 2018. A judge there said she had been ""impersonating someone with mental illness"".

Lincoln: Shrub-planting to mark Ukrainian Independence Day,"A shrub will be planted at the International Bomber Command Centre (IBCC) near Lincoln to mark Ukraine's Independence Day later.
The guelder rose is the national shrub of Ukraine and the planting has been organised by Lincoln's Ukrainian Cultural Centre.
More than 1,350 Ukrainians have made the county their temporary home since the Russian invasion.
It is 32 years since Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union.
Valeriia Krochak, founder of the centre, said: ""We have chosen Ukrainian children to plant the 'Chervona Kalyna', a red viburnum, as we believe children are the future of Ukraine.
""During the ceremony we will also honour the memory of all those who have died in this war with a minute's silence.""
The service, which starts at 18.00 BST, will take place in the IBCC's Jubilee Grove and will be marked by the singing of the Ukrainian National Anthem and the flying of the joint Ukrainian/UK flag.
The shrub features prominently in Ukrainian music, literature and art and its red berries adorn the bright embroidered blouses and shirts, the vyshyvanka, in Ukraine's national costumes.
It also features in the modern-day insignia of the country's armed forces.
Independence Day events come as the organisation running the Homes for Ukraine Scheme in Lincolnshire has appealed for more hosts.
Richard Wright, leader of North Kesteven District Council, is the Lincolnshire representative on the East Midlands Migration Board and said they were grateful to all who had participated in the scheme.
""As the war continues, we are still looking for new hosts who are able to offer temporary accommodation to Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes,"" he said.
Hannah Clark, 42, from Faldingworth near Market Rasen, said her family were joined by Tamara, 72, from Donetsk in the Donbas region of Ukraine, in January.
""As soon as I heard Tamara's story, we agreed to have her as soon as possible,"" she said.
""We are still getting to know her and her way of life, which is very different to ours, but we have learned that it was 100% worth opening our home.""
Host receive a £350 monthly payment as a thank you, which rises to £500 a month for guests who have been in the country for over a year.

Republican debate: Candidates brawl in showdown without Trump,"Republican contenders clashed on stage at their first 2024 presidential debate, as they vied to displace the absent frontrunner Donald Trump.
Eight rivals took to the stage in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to brawl over issues from Ukraine to abortion.
While most were reluctant to attack Mr Trump, some of the hopefuls did take aim at the no-show former president.
The eventual winner will challenge the Democratic candidate, probably President Joe Biden, in November 2024.
On stage in the Fox News primetime showdown on Wednesday night were Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Vice-President Mike Pence, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.
Mr DeSantis - who is struggling to hold on to a distant second place as the early promise of his campaign stutters - vowed more than once to ""send Biden back to his basement"".
But although he occupied centre stage, the Florida governor struggled for the spotlight during the two-hour forum against rising star Vivek Ramaswamy, a billionaire political newcomer.
""Do you want a super PAC puppet,"" the 38-year-old son of Indian immigrants said, ""or a patriot who speaks the truth?""
Mr Pence - a veteran debater - targeted Mr Ramaswamy's lack of experience, declaring: ""Now is not the time for on-the-job training. We don't need to bring in a rookie.""
This video can not be played
Ramaswamy: 'I was clearly the winner of this thing'
Mr Christie also derided Mr Ramaswamy as an ""amateur"", and said he sounded like a chatbot.
As the candidates squabbled at one point, Ms Haley cut in: ""This is exactly why Margaret Thatcher said, 'If you want something said, ask a man, if you want something done, ask a woman.'""
The debate exposed divisions within the party on support for Ukraine and abortion rights.
Most of the candidates pledged to back Ukraine in its war with Russia.
But Mr Ramaswamy mocked ""professional politicians on the stage that will make a pilgrimage to Kyiv to their pope Zelenksy"".
This video can not be played
Watch: Candidates reflect on how they did during debate
Ms Haley assailed Mr Ramaswamy's isolationist stance, saying: ""You have no foreign policy experience and it shows!""
There was also a clash on whether pregnancy terminations could be restricted nationwide.
Ms Haley - the only woman on stage - said it was wrong to ""make women feel like they have to decide on this issue"" when Republicans lack the Senate votes to pass such a measure. 
Mr Pence hit back that that was the ""opposite of leadership"". 
The candidates were asked by debate moderators if they would support Mr Trump should he become the Republican nominee. 
Two of the eight on stage - Mr Christie and Mr Hutchinson - did not raise their hands.
Mr Christie was booed and cheered as he said: ""The conduct [of Mr Trump] is beneath the office of president of the United States.""
Mr Hutchinson drew increasingly loud boos as he said Mr Trump was ""disqualified"" from the White House.
Mr Trump did not participate in the debate, citing his dominance in the race. He instead recorded an interview with former Fox host Tucker Carlson, which aired online at the same time in a bid to upstage the televised showdown.
The former president said he felt no need to be ""harassed"" by lesser rivals, in an interview which garnered 100 million views, according to X, formerly known as Twitter.
In the spin room after the debate, Trump spokesman Jason Miller said the former president had won despite his absence and that Mr DeSantis' performance marked ""the beginning of the end"" for the Florida governor.
The debate took place just hours before Mr Trump will travel to Georgia to be arrested on charges of plotting to subvert the 2020 election results in that state.
Despite his legal troubles, Mr Trump leads the Republican race on 62% - way more than all his rivals combined, according to an opinion poll released on Sunday by the BBC's US partner CBS News.
Mr DeSantis trails in second place on 16%. Mr Ramaswamy was third on 7%.
Mr Trump, 77, was also running neck-and-neck in a hypothetical matchup with Mr Biden, according to a Quinnipiac University opinion poll last week. It found 47% of respondents supported Mr Biden, while 46% backed Mr Trump.
At one debate-watch party in Atlanta, Georgia, about 100 young Republican voters took stock of the contenders.
Richard Polk, 33, thought Mr Trump was a good president, but ""gets in his own way"".
Ashlee Jackson, an independent voter from the area, felt the candidates should offer fewer platitudes and more details on their policy positions.
The next Republican debate takes place in Simi Valley, California, on 27 September.
Voters will begin choosing their candidate in state-by-state elections known as primaries this January, with the first taking place in Iowa.
The eventual Republican nominee will be crowned at the party convention, also in Milwaukee, in July, before the general election four months later.
With additional reporting from Kayla Epstein in Atlanta.

Chandrayaan-3: India lunar rover Pragyaan takes a walk on the Moon,"India's Moon rover has taken first steps on the lunar surface a day after the country made history by becoming the first to land near the south pole.
Chandrayaan-3's rover ""ramped down"" from the lander and ""India took a walk on the Moon!"", the space agency said.
The Vikram lander successfully touched down as planned on Wednesday evening.
With this, India joins an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.
The 26kg rover called Pragyaan (the Sanskrit word for wisdom) was carried to the Moon in the Vikram lander's belly.
After the dust raised by last evening's landing had settled, panels on one side of Vikram opened to deploy a ramp to enable Pragyaan to slide down to the lunar surface.
It will now roam around the rocks and craters, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis. 
Pragyaan is carrying two scientific instruments which will try to find out what minerals are present on the lunar surface and study the chemical composition of the soil.
Pragyaan will communicate only with the lander which will send the information to the orbiter from Chandrayaan-2 - which is still circling the Moon - to pass it on to the Earth for analysis.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has said that the rover will move at a speed of 1cm per second - with each step it will also leave on the Moon's surface the imprint of Isro's logo and emblem embossed on its six wheels.
The landing coincides with the start of a lunar day - a day on the Moon equals a little over four weeks on Earth and this will mean the lander and rover will have 14 days of sunlight to charge their batteries. 
Once night falls, they will discharge and stop working. It is not yet clear whether they will come back to life when the next lunar day starts.
The lander is also carrying several scientific instruments which will help find out what goes on the Moon's surface and above and below it.
Moon is thought to hold important minerals but one of the major goals of Chandrayaan-3 is to hunt for water - scientists say the huge craters in the south pole region which are permanently in shadow hold ice which could support human habitation on the Moon in future. 
It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations.

Watch a live simulation of the moment India’s Chandrayaan-3 lands on the Moon
On Wednesday, tense moments preceded the touchdown as the lander began its precarious descent. The lander's speed was gradually reduced from 1.68km per second to almost zero, enabling it to make a soft landing on the lunar surface. 
The historic moment was greeted with celebrations across the country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying ""India is now on the Moon"" and that ""we have reached where no other country could"". 
The landing came just days after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft spun out of control and crashed into the Moon.
The crash also put the spotlight on the difficult terrain of the south pole region where the surface is ""very uneven"" and ""full of craters and boulders"". 
India's second lunar mission, which also attempted to soft-land there in 2019, was unsuccessful - its lander and rover were destroyed, though its orbiter survived. Its continues to circle the Moon even today and is helping the Vikram lander send images and data to Earth for analysis.
India is not the only country with an eye on the Moon - there's a growing global interest in it, with many other missions headed to the lunar surface in the near future. And scientists say there is still much to understand about the Moon that's often described as a gateway to deep space.

"Ramaswamy, DeSantis, Pence: Who came out on top at the Republican debate?","This video can not be played
Watch: Candidates reflect on how they did during debate
The first Republican presidential debate was a rowdy affair that saw the eight candidates leap headlong into heated exchanges.
There were some who thought it would be boring without Donald Trump - the ultimate showman - but that was decidedly not the case. The former president may have been the life of the party during primary debates back in 2016, but the eight rivals who travelled to Wisconsin proved they could bring some excitement without his help.
Some candidates stood out from the pack, however - and some seemed to languish on the side-lines.
Here's a rundown of the winners and losers.
Vivek Ramaswamy: The man who never ran for public office - and didn't even vote for a president from 2004 to 2020 - simply dominated this Republican debate.
With a broad smile and a quick tongue, he frequently seemed to be the only candidate on the stage who was enjoying himself. That may partly be because this political novice has exceeded expectations, and is essentially playing with house money while he takes centre stage. 
He easily fended off swipes from his fellow candidates, suggesting that Mr Christie was auditioning for a show on left-leaning news channel MSNBC and that Ms Haley was angling for spots on the board of defence contractors with her positions on Ukraine.
""I'm the only person on the stage who isn't bought and paid for,"" he said during a discussion of climate change - prompting cries of outrage from his rivals.
This video can not be played
Ramaswamy: 'I was clearly the winner of this thing'
Time and time again, Mr Ramaswamy positioned himself as the outsider against a bunch of political establishment insiders. Many of his views - calling on Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, using military force to secure the US-Mexico border, and banning US companies from doing business with China - are well outside the political mainstream even within the Republican Party. But as Mr Trump demonstrated in 2016, even outlandish, impractical policy proposals can be effective in generating attention.
Mr Ramaswamy may not have the political fuel to challenge Mr Trump for the nomination, and he may not even want to, but the evening's debate ensures that he's going to continue to be a factor in this race in the months ahead.
Mike Pence: The veteran politician, who has served as a congressman, a governor and a vice-president, has a bit of fight left in him.
Although his presidential campaign has been sputtering - hated by Trump supporters and distrusted by Trump critics - his debate-stage experience served him well on Wednesday night.
He went on the attack early, swiping at Mr Ramaswamy's inexperience, saying, ""Now is not the time for on-the-job training"".
He offered a passionate, religion-based call for nationwide abortion limits. That likely won't play well in next year's general election. But it could help him win over evangelical Republicans, who can tilt the balance in states like Iowa and South Carolina, which play an outsized role in deciding the party nominee.
During the second-half of the debate, when discussion of Mr Trump came up, Mr Pence had the last word, saying he put the Constitution first on January 6, 2021 when he refused to throw out the election results at Mr Trump's behest. Several of his rivals even spoke out in his favour.
The fundamental challenges to Mr Pence's campaign remain, but for at least one night he showed why he was once considered by many conservative Republicans to be presidential material.
Nikki Haley: The former US ambassador to the UN has made a habit of surprising those who underestimate her. She has never lost a race for office, even when she was challenging more established Republican candidates for the South Carolina governorship.
On Wednesday night, she stood out by offering sharp criticism early of both Mr Trump and the Republican Party as a whole.
""Republicans did this to you too,"" she said when describing the massive US budget deficit. ""They need to stop the spending, stop the borrowing.""
When the topic turned to the former president, she said Mr Trump was the ""most disliked politician in America"" - and warned the Republican Party will suffer because of it in the general election.
She also showed will for the fight. She scrapped with Mr Ramaswamy on continuing US aid to Ukraine, which she supports. And she clashed with Mr Pence on abortion, calling his demands for a national abortion ban unrealistic and politically damaging.
Even if she can't pull ahead in the pack this time around, her debate performance could position the 51-year-old for future presidential bids in election years not dominated by a former president. 
Tim Scott and Chris Christie: Mr Christie did exactly what many expected him to. He took swipes at Mr Trump, had some choice lines targeting Mr Ramaswamy, and was generally feisty and combative.
He was also roundly booed when he was introduced, when he criticised Mr Trump, and when he took big swings at Mr Ramaswamy.
His choicest line came when he said the political neophyte ""sounds like ChatGPT"" - but that particular twist did nothing to ingratiate him with the crowd.
As for Tim Scott, his nice-guy attitude meant he frequently stayed above the fray during the most heated debate moments. That won't help him win over many voters, but it could burnish his credentials if he wants to be Mr Trump's vice-presidential pick.
Ron DeSantis: At the beginning of the year, the race for the Republican nomination seemed like it would be a two-man contest between Mr DeSantis and Mr Trump. Since then, the Florida governor has sagged in the polls.
If the rest of the Republican pack hasn't caught up to him yet, it may very well have him after this debate.
It wasn't a terrible performance - he had his moments, particularly when he spoke about his record of military service and his calls for more aggressive government policies to deal with the opioid epidemic.
He was on the side-lines for all the key moments of the debate, however. Mr Ramaswamy ran circles around him. Other candidates, like Mr Pence and Ms Haley, elbowed him out of the way on issues like abortion and US aid to Ukraine. He seemed on uneven footing when the topic turned to Mr Trump and his recent indictments.
This was not the kind of performance needed to close the gap with Mr Trump. The man who was once billed as the future of the Republican Party was simply a non-factor. 
Asa Hutchinson and Doug Burgum: Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson was the last candidate to qualify for the Milwaukee debate. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum paid his way onto the stage with a gimmick - offering enough people $20 gift cards if they donated $1 to his campaign.
Both candidates desperately needed to show that they deserved to be there, and both were mostly afterthoughts.
Mr Hutchinson's criticisms of Mr Trump seemed weak sauce compared to Mr Christie's more pointed attacks. And Mr Burgum's awe-shucks small-state conservatism never really stood out.
The qualification standards become more rigorous for next month's primary debate in California, and neither candidate did enough on Wednesday night to build the kind of support they will need to make another appearances on the debate stage likely.

North Korea's second spy satellite launch fails,"North Korea's second attempt to put a spy satellite into space has failed, three months after its first launch crashed into the sea.
The attempt on Thursday morning failed during the third stage of its flight, state media said.
For North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a spy satellite is a coveted prize, as it would let him monitor incoming attacks and plot his own more accurately. 
Pyongyang's space agency has said it will try again in October. 
South Korea said it detected the launch of the rocket at around 03:50 local time (18:50 GMT), and that it had flown through international airspace over the Yellow Sea between mainland China and the Korean peninsula.
The launch prompted an emergency warning in Japan's southernmost Okinawa prefecture minutes later, urging residents to take cover indoors. The alert was lifted after about 20 minutes.
Condemning the launch, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said: ""Behaviour like this goes against the UN resolutions and we're already firmly protesting.""
The US urged North Korea to refrain from ""further threatening activity"" and called on Pyongyang to engage in serious diplomacy.
But although Thursday's failure will have been disappointing for Pyongyang, it appears they've made progress. 
A news report in state-run KCNA blamed the failure on ""an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight"", and said the problem was ""not a big issue"".
It seems the rocket carrying the satellite flew further than during the previous attempt. Officials in Pyongyang had described the botched attempt in May as their ""gravest failure"" while vowing to try again.
And Mr Kim will most likely continue, until he succeeds. Already he is forging ahead with his weapons programme, while refusing all offers to talk to the US.
Thursday's launch comes days after leaders from the US, Japan and South Korea met at a historic summit in Washington. It also follows the start of annual military exercises between Washington and Seoul.

We're going to leave our live coverage of the Fukushima water release here for now, thanks for following along. 
Today's page was written by Nicholas Yong, Tiffanie Turnbull, Kelly Ng, Yvette Tan and Sam Hancock - with contributions from our reporters across Japan, South Korea, China and Singapore. 
It was edited by Ayeshea Perera and myself.
What happened today?
Twelve years after the nuclear disaster at Fukushima, Japan began releasing some of the contaminated water from the plant into the Pacific Ocean.
Despite widespread opposition, the government and plant operators Tepco went ahead with the plan - carefully vetted by the UN atomic regulator.
Why?
Japan used water to cool the plant's reactors when it went into meltdown in 2011 - and this highly radioactive water was then treated and collected in tanks every day. But the site was running out of storage space.
How was the water made safe?
It was treated to remove all radioactive elements, except tritium which is very difficult to remove. The water was diluted to reduce radioactivity to 1,500 becquerels per litre, far below the drinking water standard of 10,000 Bq/L.
How did it go down?
There were citizen protests in Japan and South Korea, but China's government came out swinging - labelling Japan as ""selfish"" and ""irresponsible"". It also imposed a ban on all seafood from Japan.
What happens next?
Thursday's release was the first of four scheduled between now and the end of March 2024. The entire process will take at least 30 years.
Tokyo Electric Power Company, known as Tepco, owns the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant which suffered a nuclear meltdown after it was damaged by the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.
Tepco is the fourth-largest power company in the world, supplying about one-third of Japan's electricity in the biggest cities.
It has faced billions of dollars in compensation claims since the disaster - with bankruptcy fears forcing the government to take control in 2012.
In 2014 they were sued by Fukushima workers over unpaid hazard pay. Two years later, Tepco admitted it should have announced sooner there was a nuclear meltdown at the site.
Last year, former executives were ordered to pay 13 trillion yen ($89bn) for failing to prevent the disaster.

A legal group has filed a petition to South Korea’s Constitutional Court to stop the release of Fukushima water – on behalf of more than 40,000 people and 160 whales.
Kim Young-hee of the Lawyers for a Democratic Society argues the South Korean government’s reaction to the release is unconstitutional as it fails to protect the rights of citizens.
The whales are listed as petitioners because they're identifiable and their survival is at stake, Ms Kim said.
Usually, it takes five years for South Korea’s top court to rule on such cases. However, she said the case was worth pursuing because the water release is to continue for 30 years.
Last week, a court in the Korean city of Busan dismissed a case filed by more than 160 groups against Fukushima's operators because it was beyond its jurisdiction.
In its latest statement, the UN's atomic watchdog said the tritium concentration in the Fukushima water release is well below the ""operational limit"".
Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen - the most common form of it is titrated water, which can be found in water all over the world.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - which has a permanent office at Fukushima- said an ""independent, on-site analysis"" had shown that the tritium concentration in the water discharged was ""far below the operational limit of 1,500 becquerels per litre"".
The limit is 40 times lower than the Japanese national safety standard for tritium levels in water - and around seven times lower than the limit set by the World Health Organization for drinking water (10,000 becquerels per litre).

The Fukushima issue has been
fiercely politicised in South Korea, as is often the case for matters
concerning Japan.
The government has all but
endorsed the release of the water, while the opposition is fiercely against it.

In recent weeks there have been protesters out on the streets, while the government held press conferences and made YouTube videos to try to convince the
public that the water being discharged is safe. 
Over the past year, President Yoon Suk Yeol has made considerable progress with his
attempts to improve the country’s strained relationship with Japan. Last
week’s summit between Yoon, Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and US President Joe Biden was proof of that. 
Yoon does not want all his hard work
undone over this.
The opposition claims Yoon has compromised people’s health for the sake of this relationship.
But the government says the opposition are scaremongering to win votes
ahead of next year’s election.
We've had a lot of reaction from Japan's closest neighbours, but people on the other end of the Pacific Ocean are nervous too.
As recently as June, the Pacific Island Forum (PIF) was outspoken in their opposition to Japan's plan to release the treated radioactive water.
But now PIF chair and Cook Islands PM Mark Brown says he believes it ""meets international safety standards"". A UN regulator delegation recently visited some of the concerned Pacific nations.
Mr Brown said all nations across the region may not agree on the ""complex"" issue, but he urged them to ""assess the science"".
After two years of its own checks, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) greenlit Japan's discharge plan in July.
The agency deployed its own specialist taskforce made up of nuclear safety experts from eleven countries to Fukushima.
In its final report it said Japan's water treatment and discharge plan met all international safety standards.
The IAEA has concluded that the approach and activities to the discharge of ALPS treated water taken by Japan are consistent with relevant international safety standards
Furthermore, the IAEA notes the controlled, gradual discharges of the treated water to the sea, as currently planned and assessed by TEPCO, would have a negligible radiological impact on people and the environment.

Today's water release just shows the ongoing impact of the 2011 Fukushima meltdown - the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.
Today, just over 7% of Japan’s electric power is generated by nuclear energy. But before 2011, the figure stood at 30%.
The Fukushima disaster prompted anti-nuclear protests across the country and the government halted all nuclear power plants.
The move resulted in a rise in electricity prices with the then boss of Tepco, which owns the Fukushima power plant, warning of further hikes. 
Nuclear energy remains a deeply divisive topic but the public sentiment has started to shift and many lawmakers are now pushing to restart the rest of Japan's nuclear power plants.
It coincides with Japan’s aim to be carbon neutral by 2050 because as of now, Japan still relies heavily on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and liquefied natural gas, most of which are imported from overseas and vulnerable to market price changes.

Fear and anger has intensified on Chinese social media, with Twitter-like platform Weibo publishing new posts on the move by the second.
Some users worry that eating seafoood could harm even future generations.
""Why isn't the world concerned about the release of radioactive water into the oceans? This isn't just a question of whether seafood is safe to eat. The circulation of currents means this will affect the whole world,"" one comment read.
China is known for censoring social media posts which don't align with the state's position. 
A Weibo poll for reactions on Tokyo's move included just these options: 
Our Beijing correspondent earlier explained how China has tried to characterise the discharge as a uniquely Japanese act- despite itself being a nuclear power.

Fishermen in South Korea have long been opposed to release of the water, not because they thought it was unsafe, but because they worried people here would stop buying their fish.
After the disaster in 2011, South Korea banned the sale of seafood from around Fukushima. The fisherman here feared that once the water was released into the ocean, and free to make its way into South Korea’s seas, their catch would also be tainted.
In a survey last month almost two thirds of people said they would eat less seafood or no seafood at all if the water was released.
Now the fishermen’s fear has become a reality - they are urging the government to support them financially.
The authorities have promised to monitor the water closely. It will test local seafood for radiation every day, and test water in real time from more than 200 locations.

As Hong Kong declared a ban yesterday on seafood imports from 10 prefectures in Japan, sushi lovers in the Chinese territory grabbed their ""last
chance"" to taste the freshly delivered raw fish slices, or sashimi.
Hong Kong, Japan's second biggest seafood market after mainland
China, bought 75.5bn yen (US$520m; £409m) worth of seafood from Japan last year.
The BBC spoke to diners concerned about the Fukushima discharge but who did not agree with the ban.

Many scientists have backed Japan’s plan, saying it is
sound.
We’ve heard earlier from nuclear chemistry experts and molecular
pathologists who stress that the discharged water will not make the sea much
more radioactive than it already is – and in the first place, that threat to
humans is very, very small.
But it is also
worth noting that there is some disquiet in the science and
environment community.
Some marine biologists and ocean experts, for example,
have argued that more studies need to be done on how 30 years of continued
discharge would affect the ocean bed and marine life. 
The US National Association
of Marine Laboratories released a statement in December saying they were not convinced by Japan’s data.
""We've seen an inadequate radiological, ecological impact assessment that makes us very concerned that Japan would not only be unable to detect what's getting into the water, sediment and organisms, but if it does, there is no recourse to remove it... there's no way to get the genie back in the bottle,"" marine biologist Robert Richmond from the University of Hawaii told the BBC earlier this year.
The waste water being released from Fukushima has been treated to have 64 radioactive elements removed  - except tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which is very difficult to remove from water.
It's an element found in many places-  as you can see below.
In the post below, a South Korean diver told the BBC she was worried about drinking the water.
But even if you tried to drink excessive amounts of the seawaters from the Pacific Ocean, the radiation dose would be insignificant, says molecular pathology expert Prof Gerry Thomas.
Japan’s nuclear wastewater has been treated so the level of tritium - the element people are worried about - has been diluted to 1,500 becquerel per litre. A becquerel is a unit of radioactivity.
That is seven times less than the benchmark set by the World Health Organization for safe drinking water - and that is before the wastewater is diluted further by the ocean.
“The water released will be a drop in the ocean, both in terms of volume and radioactivity,” Thomas says.
“There is no evidence that these extremely low levels of radioisotopes have a detrimental health effect.” 
And anyway, humans can't drink large amounts of seawater - because it's too salty and our bodies can't process it.

Some of the more than 3,000 traditional female divers known as “haenyeo” on
South Korea’s picturesque Jeju Island are anxious about the release of the
Fukushima water. 
Jeju haenyeo dive deep into the sea to gather shellfish and seaweed. They don’t use oxygen masks, their sole protection consists of a rubber suit and goggles and they only work about 90 days a year when the water is warm enough.
“Now I feel it’s unsafe to dive in,” says Kim Eun-ah, who has
been doing this job for six years. 
Even though scientists says today's release of water is safe and the radiation amounts smaller that what the ocean naturally contains, many people have the wrong impression.
Ms Kim says she is worried about her health as haeneyo drink in seawater
while diving.“We consider ourselves as part of the sea because we immerse
ourselves in the water with our own bodies.”

Reporting from Fukushima
There's been a great deal of anger and anxiety today in Fukushima. Local fishermen are worried about perception and have called it a ""second disaster"" for their livelihoods after the 2011 nuclear meltdown.

As we've seen, there's been immediate concerns about the safety of seafood now. China has just banned all Japanese fish imports.
But experts say concerns about the effects of treated water on seafood has “no basis in scientific evidence”.
Mark Foreman, an Associate Professor of Nuclear Chemistry in Sweden, has previously said those who eat heaps of seafood will only be exposed to “low” doses of radiation - in the range of 0.0062 to 0.032 microSv per year. 
Again, humans can safely be exposed to tens of thousands of times more than that - up to 1,000 microSv of radiation per year.
Professor Gerry Thomas, a former professor of Molecular Pathology, Imperial College London, also dismissed questions whether the wider food chain will also be at risk.
“The answer to this question [is] a resounding “no!”

Japanese authorities and Tepco officials have been facing a welter of criticism, and it's prodded them to mount a comprehensive publicity blitz.
In Japan, they have put out explanatory pieces in local media, paid for posters in airports and train stations, organised public education events and school tours, and even set up livestreams of fish swimming in tanks of the treated water. They've also invited foreign delegations and news outlets - including the BBC - to tour Tepco's premises.
Online, Tepco and various Japanese government ministries have published reams of explainers in Japanese and English. Tepco even has an entire portal dedicated to the topic which comes in different versions aimed at readers in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea - places which have levied criticism or put in place Fukushima seafood bans.
Tepco is also promising to post on its website hourly updates of the radiation levels at various stages of the water discharge process. 
All this is part of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's pledge to maintain a ""high level of transparency"". But it's been two years since they first announced their plan, and Japan remains deeply divided on the issue while many neighbours are rancorously opposed to the water's discharge. 
Despite all their efforts, Japanese authorities have not managed to calm the waters.
As we reported earlier, China has decided to completely suspend seafood from all of Japan, expanding on an existing ban on seafood from Fukushima and some surrounding prefectures.
Now in a statement, its customs office says that it is to ""protect the health of Chinese consumers"".
In order to comprehensively prevent the food safety risks of radioactive contamination... protect the health of Chinese consumers, and ensure the safety of imported food, the General Administration of Customs has... decided to completely suspend the import of aquatic products (including live aquatic animals) originating in Japan from August 24, 2023
Japan wants to release Fukushima's waste water into the ocean - and a lot of people are not happy.

Rudy Giuliani and other Trump co-defendants surrender in Georgia election case,"Rudy Giuliani, who was Donald Trump's personal lawyer, has surrendered at a jail in Atlanta, Georgia on charges of helping Mr Trump try to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state.
Mr Giuliani, who was released on a $150,000 (£118,000) bond, faces 13 charges including racketeering.
The former New York mayor is one of 19 people, including Mr Trump, indicted in the election interference case.  
Mr Trump has said he will attend jail to be booked on Thursday afternoon.
While yet to enter a plea, he denies wrongdoing and has said the charges are politically motivated.
Leaving the Fulton County jail, Mr Giuliani told reporters he was ""honoured"" to be involved in the case.
""This case is a fight for our way of life,"" he said. ""This indictment is a travesty."" 
Mr Giuliani and Mr Trump face the most charges among all those accused.
Before Mr Giuliani, seven of Mr Trump's other co-defendants had arrived in Atlanta to be processed, including lawyer John Eastman, Georgia bail bondsman Scott Hall, and Sidney Powell - another lawyer who allegedly took a central role in efforts to undermine the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. 
Former Georgia Republican Party Chairman David Shafer, Cathy Latham, Ray Smith III and Kenneth Chesebro have also been booked at the jail. 
Prosecutors in Fulton County have set a deadline of noon local time on Friday for each of the defendants to surrender. They will then appear in court to hear the charges against them at a later date.
Those who were booked on Wednesday had mugshots taken and posted to the Fulton County website within hours. Mr Trump is also expected to get his mugshot taken.
Like Mr Giuliani, the former president faces 13 charges including racketeering and election meddling. Mr Trump is yet to enter a plea, but he denies wrongdoing and has said the charges are politically motivated.
In a post on Wednesday to his social media site, Truth Social, Mr Trump said he would ""proudly be arrested"" on Thursday afternoon. 
""Nobody has ever fought for election integrity like President Donald J. Trump,"" he wrote.
Mr Trump has already been granted a $200,000 bond and issued with other release conditions, such as being barred from using social media to directly or indirectly threaten alleged co-conspirators or potential witnesses.
The former president, who Forbes estimates to have a personal wealth of $2.5bn, has drawn criticism for not paying the legal fees of his co-defendants.
One of them, ex-Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""this has became a bigger principle than just one man. So why isn't MAGA, Inc funding everyone's defence?""
Another former Trump lawyer, Michael Cohen, now a fierce critic of his former boss, told CNN on Tuesday that Mr Trump was not paying Mr Giuliani's fees. The BBC has contacted Mr Giuliani's lawyer for comment.
Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, another co-defendant, filed court papers asking a judge for an immediate ruling on a bid to move his case from Fulton County to a federal court, or - alternatively - to issue an order shielding him from arrest in Georgia. 
The filing came after Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis denied a request to delay Mr Meadows' arrest. An email from Ms Willis included in the filing said Mr Meadows ""is no different than any other criminal defendant in this jurisdiction"". 
A similar request was made by former justice department official Jeffrey Clark. Lawyers for both men have argued that their alleged actions should be handled by the federal court system, as they were federal officials at their time of their alleged involvement in the case. 
The Georgia case is the latest in a series of criminal indictments filed against Mr Trump.
He faces 78 charges across three other criminal cases, including an investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified documents.

The Woman in the Wall: Ruth Wilson drama examines Magdalene Laundries,"The Magdalene Laundries were back in the spotlight recently following the death of Irish singer Sinead O'Connor, who spent time in one of the former asylums as a teenager. A new BBC drama examines the impact of the abuse which took place at some of these notorious institutions. 
Many of the obituaries published following O'Connor's death last month noted the time she spent as a young woman in Dublin's An Grianan Training Centre, a Catholic-run institution which used to be the High Park Magdalene Laundry, where children and teenagers were routinely treated badly.
The laundries had been theoretically set up to house ""fallen women"" - a blanket term which included unmarried mothers, women deemed to have been badly behaved, promiscuous or sexually abused, or who were considered uncooperative or burdens on their families.
Shoplifting and truancy led to O'Connor being placed in the institution for 18 months in her teens. She later referred to it as a ""prison"", where she said she was deprived of a normal childhood, and girls ""cried every day"". 
Women lived and worked without wages - O'Connor recalled being assigned jobs such as washing priests' clothes for no pay. She said the women generally studied maths and typing and had limited contact with their families. 
The singer's time there did help set her own path to a career in music, after one nun gave her a guitar and connected her with a music teacher. But glints of light and hope such as this were rare.
Coincidentally, the BBC commissioned a six-part TV drama about the Magdalene Laundries last year, prior to O'Connor's death. Created and written by Joe Murtagh and starring Ruth Wilson, the Woman in the Wall launches on BBC One on Sunday at 21:00 BST.
Murtagh says his primary motivation for writing about the laundries was to increase awareness of a story about which many still know little.
""Outside of Ireland, in my experience, this isn't really known about, and with the people who do tend to know about it, it's because they've seen films including the Magdalene Sisters or Philomena,"" he tells BBC News.
""When you read into it, you see how harrowing it was, the scale of it, and how many tens of thousands of lives it's touched. It was a bit of history that interested me and engaged me emotionally, but the driving factor was just people not knowing about it enough.""
The image conjured up by many when they think of the laundries is of the young women, mostly teens, who were held there. But actress Wilson, who stars in and co-produced the series, notes that women of all ages were admitted.
""Particular things shocked me, like women who were going into these laundries in their 40s - because they got pregnant out of wedlock,"" she says.
""Grown women, it wasn't just girls, it was women of all ages, the oldest was something like 89. They were shamed into these institutions.""
Wilson and Murtagh both did extensive research while working on the show - which included reading books, watching documentaries and speaking to real-life survivors.
""Another thing that shocked me, and this didn't happen in all of them, but in some of them, the girls gave birth, and then they'd have to nurse their child for two years, and then their child was taken away from them,"" says Wilson.
""Stuff like that is horrific; the fact that girls weren't given any gas and air or weren't stitched up after birth. The nuns wouldn't let them. Things like that, you just go, wow, it's pure horror.""
Some women who stayed at the former institutions have told of being physically or sexually abused, and many said they spent their time scrubbing floors and doing other physical labour.
An estimated 30,000 women were confined in the laundries over the years, and the impact of time spent there on the survivors was significant and long-lasting.
O'Connor's time at the former laundry laid the groundwork for her appearance on Saturday Night Live in 1992, which saw her tear up a picture of the Pope live on air in protest against sexual and physical abuse in the Catholic Church, telling the stunned audience: ""Fight the real enemy.""
Years later, Pope John Paul II would acknowledge that abuse had taken place in Catholic institutions across the world. But it took years for the women who had been housed at the laundries to be taken seriously. Wilson refers to the denial or downplaying of what happened to them as a form of ""gaslighting"".
""The silence around it, if your experience is denied, over and over again... the experience itself is horrific, but the aftermath of nobody listening to you, and actively denying that what you're saying is true, I imagine that's deeply traumatic too,"" she says.
""Any chance to get this story understood or get people to dig a bit deeper or read about it, I hope must be a little bit of validation.""
Set in 2015, the Woman in the Wall follows Lorna (Wilson) - a clearly damaged woman who is often aggressive with those around her. It soon transpires that, as a teenager, Lorna's baby was taken from her after she was forced to attend a convent.
Wilson is no stranger to playing unpredictable and sometimes unhinged women, such as Alice Morgan in Luther. 
But the inner turmoil she portrays here hints at something far darker, a woman who carries truly chilling memories. Wilson hopes the audience ""will try to understand this character at the heart of it and why she's acting the way she does"". 
""Yes, she's damaged, but she's damaged because of what happened to her. The world has treated her like she's mad, but actually, they're mad for putting her inside. If someone has been gaslit their whole life, how will they feel?""
The series is set in the fictional Irish town of Kilkinure, where local women have been campaigning for the state to recognise that the convent was a former Magdalene Laundry.
Murtagh says part of the reason for setting the series somewhere fictional was to ""protect any people that we spoke to"" during the period of researching.
""We didn't want anyone to be able to point their finger at any one person, institution or place, and thereby discredit them or their stories,"" he explains.
""It was also an opportunity to be able to compile all the research we did and draw on as many stories as we could, and set it all in the one fictional town.""
The women in the series fight for justice and acknowledgement, pointing out how recently the laundries were in operation. ""People think this couldn't happen again, but the last laundry closed in 1996,"" points out one character. ""It wasn't medieval times, the Macarena was in the charts.""
But for a series with such a grim theme, there are still moments of levity. The snappy, acerbic dialogue, delivered with characteristic Irish humour, will be familiar to fans of playwright Martin McDonagh's style.
The first episode is both engaging and educational. While horrific historical abuse and its long-lasting impact is the core theme of the show, it otherwise plays out as a traditional whodunnit involving mystery, murder and local detectives. 
Murtagh, who has said he does not have a personal connection to the laundries, says it was important not to be ""exploitative"" in the process of writing the series, adding that it was ""tricky to balance"" the blend of fact and fiction.
But, he adds, placing a murder mystery at the core of the drama provided an opportunity to ""smuggle a story like [the Magdalene laundries] under the radar"".
""My natural sensibility is to play with genre anyway, but what I find really useful about genre is everyone has this inherent understanding of how genre works, how horror or comedy should function,"" he says. 
""So it provides a useful vehicle for everyone to grasp on to, so you've immediately got something that is easier to transport as dark and relatively unknown as this to a wider audience.""
The first two episodes of The Woman In The Wall air on Sunday 27 and Monday 28 August at 21:00 BST on BBC One. The series then continues weekly on Mondays on BBC One and also on iPlayer.

Nepal gay marriage 'victory' hits legal roadblock,"Maya Gurung and Surendra Pandey were poised to create history.
Maya is a transgender woman but has not changed her gender on official documents. Her partner Surendra is a gay man. 
They were to be Nepal's first same-sex couple to legally get married, following an interim order from the country's Supreme Court that directed the government to register such unions until it prepared legislation to change the law.
The couple had a temple wedding ceremony in 2017 but wanted their union to be legally recognised.  
The order was hailed by progressives as a historic one that would bring relief to same-sex couples in the Himalayan nation. 
But the couple's dreams were not to be. 
On 13 July, the district court in Nepal's capital Kathmandu, refused to register their marriage, arguing that lower courts were not bound to follow the interim order as it was only directed at the government. 
""We had many dreams, but they are now shattered,"" Ms Gurung told the BBC. ""It made us feel like we are not citizens of this country.""
The couple has lodged an appeal at a High Court in the city of Patan, but the hearing has been postponed five times already.
The district court's refusal to register the marriage is being seen as a fresh setback to decades of progress Nepal has made to improve legal protections and social acceptance of sexual minorities.  
Pinky Gurung, who leads LGBTQ rights group, Blue Diamond Society, says the community still has ""a long fight"" to achieve marriage equality. 
""The court, especially the Supreme Court, is the only entity that has favoured us many times.""
Sunil Babu Pant, who was the country's first openly gay MP, and the founder of Blue Diamond Society, has called the ""lingering"" process ""unjust to the entire sexual and gender minority community"". 
""We pushed Maya and Surendra's case as a test. Once their marriage gets registered, all other aspiring couples will be able to register their marriage.""
The couple's disappointment at the lower court ruling has been heightened by the trouble Mr Pandey and Ms Gurung went through to get their marriage registered.
Before they approached the court, they had to first travel to Mr Pandey's village in Nawalparasi - about 150km (93 miles) from the capital - to get a recommendation letter from the local government.  
The drive should have only taken four to five hours, but monsoon rains and accompanying landslides meant they spent 12 hours on the road. ""We were sweating like pigs in the bus for at least four hours,"" Ms Gurung says.   
On returning to Kathmandu, the couple were told to get another letter from the ward office in their neighbourhood. Then, officials told them to bring a proof of residence letter, which had to be signed by their landlord and two other neighbours.  
The court also ordered Ms Gurung - who had been married to a woman before - to provide documents proving her first marriage had been dissolved in 2013, which would allow her to marry again. ""I have suffered a lot,"" Ms Gurung says. 
She says she knew at a very young age that she didn't identify with her sex, but was worried it would bring shame on her family as her father was a village chief.  
When she was 13, she moved to Kathmandu where she was able to live openly as a transgender woman.
But two years later, her family forced her to marry a woman. They went on to have two children. She says she suffered from depression because of the marriage and is not in touch with her children. In 2013, she filed for divorce. 
That same year, Nepal issued a third gender in citizenship certificates following a landmark court ruling, six years earlier.
In 2015, Ms Gurung met Mr Pandey in Nawalparasi, close to where her sister owned a restaurant. 
Mr Pandey had been always attracted to men - but he fell in love with Maya as soon as they met. He now says he is not sure how to categorise his sexual orientation. 
The relationship gave him the courage to come out to his older sister, who raised him from the age of six, when their parents died of typhoid.
""Initially my sister did not accept it, she was worried and anxious about me and my future, but gradually she accepted the fact that I am different.""
Mr Pandey followed Ms Gurung to Kathmandu, and they gradually won the approval of their families. 
After two years of dating, the couple held a wedding ceremony at a Hindu temple in Kathmandu, in 2017. Dozens of family members and friends attended. They danced and sang all night to the music of five traditional musical instruments called panche bajas. 
Since then, they have been living together with their pet dog, Suru. ""We clean our flat together, we cook together, I like Maya's chicken recipe very much,"" Mr Pandey says. 
He says they are hopeful that their marriage will be registered and ready to bring the case to the Supreme Court again if necessary. 
After their marriage is recognised, they want to open a joint bank account and share the ownership of the land they bought. But their biggest dream is to adopt a child, once their finances are more stable. 
Just like other couples, they sometimes argue but say they make up quickly. 
""We can't afford to fight. We need to get along as we have a long life ahead,"" says Mr Pandey.

How Russia reacted after Prigozhin plane crash,"This video can not be played
Watch: Prigozhin, from hot dog seller to mercenary group leader
Russia is a country full of surprises.
People here were shocked this summer after drones attacked the centre of Moscow on several occasions, causing explosions and damage to buildings.
Then, the Russian rouble took an unexpected tumble - briefly tipping the dollar rate to over 100 roubles.
Add to that, a failed mission to the Moon: Russia's 'Luna-25' lander was lost in space, destroyed as it collided with the lunar surface last week.
But today, as the news broke that Yevgeny Prigozhin's plane had fallen out of the sky, crashing in a fireball in Russia's Tver Region, most people were far from shocked. In fact, most Russians were probably surprised it hadn't happened sooner.
Speculation had been swirling for weeks in Russia about exactly what fate awaited Yevgeny Prigozhin. Exactly two months ago, the Wagner boss launched his brief mutiny.
His mercenaries seized a major Russian city and even marched on Moscow. After the rebellion was called off, many thought Prigozhin's days were numbered. After all, the mutiny was a significant humiliation for the Kremlin, and President Putin isn't the kind of man to forgive and forget.
About an hour after the crash, the Russian Federal Aviation Agency Rosaviatsiya released a statement confirming that Yevgeny Prigozhin's name was on the passenger manifest.
That is unusually quick for Rosaviatsiya: the agency is usually much slower to respond to such incidents. That raised eyebrows here.
Russian state TV is keeping reporting of the incident to a minimum, quoting government officials with no comment. In its main evening news bulletin, Kremlin-controlled Channel One dedicated just 30 seconds to the story.
It is a well-known fact in Russia that state TV channels often wait until they receive official instructions regarding the tone of reporting.
As for the Wagner group itself, Telegram channels linked to the mercenaries have claimed that Prigozhin ""was killed….by traitors of Russia"". At the Wagner HQ in the city of St Petersburg, a makeshift shrine has appeared. Images on Russian media show people bringing flowers and candles to the Wagner Centre.
Attention is now turning to what happened on board the flight. According to Russian media, investigators are looking into a number of possible causes, including ""external actions"".
Commenting on the incident, political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said that the cause of the plane crash is not important - more significant is the message it sends to any other potential mutineers: ""Everyone will see this as an act of retaliation and retribution…From Putin's perspective, as well as many among the security and military officials, Prigozhin's death should serve as a lesson.""

How Trump rivals will sell themselves as he skips Republican debate in Milwaukee,"With one glaring exception, Republican candidates for the 2024 White House race are gathering on Wednesday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the party's first primary debate.
Former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner in the contest, isn't just skipping the affair, however, he's actively trying to undermine it. 
He is lashing out at Fox News, the network running the debate, and releasing his sit-down interview with former Fox host Tucker Carlson at the same time as his rivals take to the stage. 
His absence - along with the interview, which will air on X, the social media site formally called Twitter - means the remaining candidates will have a much harder time attracting the attention of Republican voters. And it will be harder to make the case that they, not the nominee in the past two presidential elections, should be the party's standard-bearer.
Republican opinion surveys show Mr Trump is the current choice of more than half of likely primary voters, so the rest of the field will have to find ways to highlight what they believe is wrong with him - and why they are the better choice.
Some are doing this directly; others in the most roundabout way. Time will tell which strategy is better - or if, given Mr Trump's dominant position, they all end up equally bad.
With that in mind, here's a look at the candidates who have qualified for the debate stage.
The Florida governor's critique of the former president is that he was too frequently distracted and derailed during his time as president. If Mr Trump had been more focused, Mr DeSantis reasons, he would have accomplished more while in office.
Mr DeSantis has also criticised his fellow Florida resident for dwelling too much on the past - particularly his 2020 presidential election defeat - and being too mired in scandal to win the White House next year.
""If the election becomes a referendum on what document was left by the toilet at Mar-a-Lago, we are not going to win,"" he said during a recent campaign stop in Iowa, referencing Mr Trump's indictment for mishandling classified material after his time in office.
The Florida governor is presenting himself to Republican voters as a conservative who can produce the kind of results Mr Trump promised in 2016 but was unable to deliver. He points to his record as Florida governor, which includes loosening gun-ownership laws, restricting sex and gender identity education in schools, tightening voting rules, and limiting abortions. 
It was a pitch that earlier this year seemed like it might be effective for party faithful interested in moving on from Mr Trump. Instead, it has fallen flat so far. The Milwaukee debate will be one of the best remaining opportunities for Mr DeSantis to resuscitate that message.
Vivek Ramaswamy's campaign strategy is straightforward: Metaphorically hug Donald Trump, and allow his youth and charismatic stage presence to win over the support of Trump-friendly voters who are looking for a new face unconnected to the political system.
The 38-year-old tech executive with no previous experience in elected office is the only candidate who has explicitly said he would use his presidential authority to pardon Mr Trump if he were convicted on federal charges. He is outspoken on gun rights, religious liberty and hot-button social issues, and has suggested requiring those under 25 to take a civics test or serve in the military or as a first responder before they are allowed to vote.
Mr Ramaswamy's ardent defence of the former president - and his recent rise in polls of Republican primary voters - could make him a debate target for other candidates looking to attack Mr Trump by proxy or just interested in taking the ambitious newcomer down a peg.
The former vice-president has had to walk a fine line during his campaign. He is running on the same four-year record in office as his old boss, but wants Republican voters to opt for the understudy instead of the leading man.
The most obvious - and most potentially fraught - tactic is for the Indiana politician to highlight his refusal to give in to Mr Trump's pressure to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
""President Trump... demanded that I choose between him and the constitution,"" he said in his campaign announcement speech. ""I chose the constitution, and I always will.""
Beyond that, he has tried to differentiate himself by highlighting his long record of support for traditional conservative policies - on topics like abortion, taxes and foreign policy. 
If polls are a guide, however, his message has alienated Trump supporters while failing to convince anti-Trump Republicans. On the debate stage, he'll have to figure out a way to pull at least some Republican voters in one of those two camps to his side.
If Tim Scott has a beef with Donald Trump, he's not willing to share it publicly. Instead, the South Carolina senator has been running a relentlessly optimistic campaign, leaning heavily on his personal story of overcoming childhood poverty to become his state's first black senator.
He also frequently emphasises his personal religious beliefs, which stand in contrast to Mr Trump's less pronounced - and sometimes awkward - displays of faith.
His strategy seems to be not offending any Republican voters and using his substantial cash reserves - built up during Senate campaigns - to position himself as the de facto alternative to Mr Trump as other candidates fall by the wayside.
After the US Capitol riot by Trump supporters, Nikki Haley was fairly outspoken in her criticism of the former president, saying his actions since his election defeat would be ""judged harshly by history"".
It was a rather dramatic change of course for the woman who spent two years working for Mr Trump as US ambassador to the United Nations, and who received a warm Oval Office send-off from the president when she left the administration.
Although the former South Carolina governor backed away from her harsher critique in the run-up to launching her presidential bid, she has drawn some contrasts with her former boss, particularly on US support of Ukraine.
She has also emphasised her relatively young age - 51 - in a comparison that is explicitly directed at 80-year-old President Biden but could apply just as well to the 77-year-old Trump.
Chris Christie was one of the first prominent Republican officeholders to endorse Donald Trump during his first presidential bid in 2016. Since then, he has heel-turned and become one of the former president's sharpest critics within the party.
He has called Mr Trump's efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 election, leading up to the US Capitol riot by his supporters, a ""stain on our country's history"". He said Mr Trump violated his constitutional oath and ""brought shame to his presidency"".
When he launched his presidential campaign, Mr Christie pointed to the Republican primary debates as an opportunity to dent Mr Trump's nomination hopes. With the former president absent from Milwaukee, however, he will be stuck directing his fire at an empty podium.
Little-known governor of North Dakota Doug Burgum garnered some media attention by qualifying for the debate stage in part by offering $20 gift cards to the first 20,000 people who donated at least $1 to his campaign.
The former tech executive, who is using his billion-dollar personal wealth to fund his campaign, is focusing on the economy and says he wants to run the federal government more like a business. When asked about Mr Trump, he tends to change the subject.
He almost couldn't make it on stage, after he tore his Achilles heel during a friendly basketball game with his campaign staff, according to CNN. But after touring the debate site on crutches Wednesday, he confirmed on social media ""I'm in"".
As the longest of longshot candidates on Wednesday's debate stage, he will probably be more concerned with simply trying to get Republican voters to remember his name.
Asa Hutchinson was once a popular conservative governor in Arkansas. His veto late in his term of a law restricting transgender medical treatment for children, and his criticism of Mr Trump, have dented his standing among many Republicans, however. 
Like Mr Christie, he may try to use the Milwaukee debate to explicitly make the case that Mr Trump is an unsuitable nominee for the Republican party. After the Republican frontrunner's first indictment, Mr Hutchinson called for him to drop out of the race - and has repeated the demand in subsequent months.  
Also like Mr Christie, however, the Arkansan's opportunity to dent Mr Trump's standing among Republican voters will likely be diminished by the former president's absence from the debate stage.

Was Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin a dead man walking?,"This video can not be played
Watch: Prigozhin, from hot dog seller to mercenary group leader
Ever since he led a mutinous march on Moscow in late June Yevgeny Prigozhin was described by Russia watchers as ""a dead man walking"".
Commenting recently on the mercenary boss's life expectancy the CIA Director William Burns even said: ""If I were Prigozhin I wouldn't fire my food taster"". 
If it is ever proven that the mid-air destruction of a plane carrying Yevgeny Prigozhin was an act of deliberate, cold-blooded revenge by the Kremlin, this will go down in Russian history as the ultimate ""special military operation"". 
Prigozhin, a former convict, chef and hot dog salesman-turned mercenary boss, had a lot of admirers amongst the ranks of his Wagner mercenary army and beyond. Many will have witnessed his warm reception by the public in Rostov-on-Don when he turned up there exactly two months ago in the throes of his aborted one-day rebellion. 
But he also had a lot of enemies in Moscow, most notably in the upper ranks of the Russian military whose leaders he frequently and publicly criticised. 
What has probably turned out to have been his fatal mistake was crossing President Putin when he launched that march on Moscow on 23 June. Although he did not mention Putin by name at the time, Prigozhin infuriated the Kremlin by very publicly criticising the official reasons given for Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He told Russians they had been deceived and that their sons were dying in the Ukraine war due to poor leadership. This was heresy and Putin's video message on that day was sizzling with vitriol. He called Prigozhin's march on Moscow a betrayal and a stab in the back.
Vladimir Putin does not forgive traitors nor those who challenge him.
The former Russian intelligence officer-turned defector, Alexander Litvinenko, died a slow and agonising death in a London hospital in 2006 after he was poisoned with radioactive Polonium-210.
A subsequent investigation concluded that this assassins brought the lethal substance with them from Russia and that it could only have been sourced from a Russian government laboratory. Moscow denied any involvement but refused to surrender the two suspects for trial.
Then there was Sergei Skripal, a former Russian KGB officer and again a defector to Britain. 
In 2018 he and his daughter Yulia narrowly escaped death when GRU Russian military intelligence officers allegedly put Novichok nerve agent on the door handle of his house in Salisbury.
A discarded perfume bottle containing the lethal agent was later found by a local Wiltshire resident, Dawn Sturgess, who died after applying it to her wrists.
Inside Russia there is a long list of people, including both critics and businessmen, who have met with sudden death, in some cases ""falling out of upper floor windows"". President Putin's most vocal opponent, Alexei Navalny, is now languishing in a penal colony on what are said to be politically-motivated fraud charges. He too survived assassination by Novichok nerve agent poisoning after nearly dying onboard a flight across Siberia in 2020.
But Prigozhin was a very different case, which makes his demise all the more controversial for Russians. Here was a man who was extremely useful to the Kremlin and seen by some Russians as a national hero.
His Wagner group of mercenaries, founded in 2014, was formed from a hard core of former Russian Speznaz (Special Forces) operatives and other soldiers. It has been highly active in eastern Ukraine where it drove the Ukrainian army out of Bakhmut, acquiring a fearsome reputation not shared by the often decrepit and poorly-led regular Russian army. Wagner bolstered its ranks when Prigozhin personally toured Russian penal colonies to recruit thousands of convicts, including rapists and murderers. These were effectively used as cannon fodder in eastern Ukraine where commanders ordered them to advance into withering fire in repeated attempts to overwhelm the enemy lines.
Wagner have also been operating in Syria for years but it is in Africa where they have achieved strategic success for the Kremlin. There they have developed a brutally effective business model that is proving popular with undemocratic regimes. By providing a range of ""security services"", from VIP protection to influencing elections, silencing critics, they have received in return mineral rights and access to gold and other precious metals in several African states. Money flows back to Moscow and everyone gets rich - except the actual populations of those countries. 
Wagner troops have been accused of numerous human rights abuses including the massacre of civilians in Mali and Central African Republic. Yet they have succeeded in supplanting French and other western forces across a huge swathe of the African continent. Only this week Prigozhin popped up on a Telegram channel in a video presumed to have been filmed at a base in Mali, promising an expansion of Wagner's activities in Africa and ""freedom"" for its people.
Despite all this, there are certainly some back in Moscow, notably in military intelligence, who viewed him as a liability, a loose cannon and a potential future threat to Putin's rule and the system around him.

Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin presumed dead after Russia plane crash,"Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was on the passenger list of a jet which crashed in Russia killing all 10 people on board, Russia's civil aviation authority says.
Social media linked to the Wagner mercenary group say his private plane was shot down by Russian air defences.
Prigozhin died ""as a result of actions of traitors to Russia"", the Grey Zone Telegram channel posted. 
Prigozhin led an aborted mutiny against Russia's armed forces in June.
However, some experts in Russia and abroad suggest the revolt was staged, and Prigozhin abandoned his ""justice march"" on Moscow after direct orders from President Vladimir Putin.
Wednesday's crash in the Tver region, north-west of the capital Moscow, comes on the same day that senior Russian general Sergei Surovikin was reportedly sacked as air force chief.
Gen Surovikin was known to have good relations with Prigozhin and had not been seen in public since the mutiny.
Prigozhin's aircraft - an Embraer-135 (EBM-135BJ) - was flying from Moscow to St Petersburg on Wednesday with seven passengers and three crew, Russia's Rosaviatsia aviation authority said.
Senior Wagner commander Dmitry Utkin - who founded the group in 2014 - was also on the passenger list, it said.
The plane is reported to have come down near the village of Kuzhenkino, about half-way between Moscow and St Petersburg.
One report said the body of Prigozhin, 62, had been found and identified - this has not been officially confirmed.
All 10 bodies have been recovered, Russia's state-run news agency Interfax said.
Grey Zone said local residents had heard two bangs before the crash and had seen two vapour trails.
Tass news agency said the plane had caught fire on hitting the ground.
The aircraft had been in the air for less than half-an-hour, it added.
An investigation has been launched into the crash and emergency services are searching the scene.
At the same time, Grey Zone reported that a second business jet owned by Prigozhin had landed safely in the Moscow region.
The mercenary group has about 25,000 fighters.
The group has been active in Ukraine, Syria and west Africa, and has gained a reputation for brutality.
Prigozhin headed the mutiny on 23-24 June, moving his troops from Ukraine, seizing the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, and threatening to march on Moscow.
The move came after months of tension with Russian military commanders over the invasion of Ukraine launched by President Putin in 2014.
The stand-off seemed to have been settled by a deal which allowed Wagner troops to move to Belarus or join the Russian army.
Prigozhin himself agreed to relocate to Belarus - but has apparently been able to move freely, making public appearances in Russia and releasing a video of him purportedly in Africa.
But several Russia watchers have described him as a ""dead man walking"" since the mutiny.
President Putin's initial reaction to his challenge to Russia's defence establishment was vitriolic, calling it a betrayal and a stab in the back in a video message on 24 June. 
The deal did not mean he was safe. 
""Revenge"", commented CIA director William Burns, ""is a dish Putin prefers served cold"" - or words to that effect. 
None of this, of course, is proof that Prigozhin and his entourage were deliberately targeted. 
But given the circumstances any claims that his demise, if confirmed, was an accident will see a lot of eyebrows raised.
US President Joe Biden said he was ""not surprised"" by news of Prigozhin's possible death.

Russia's aviation authority says that the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was on a plane that crashed in western Russia.

Wagner boss Prigozhin's years of living dangerously,"This video can not be played
Watch: Yevgeny Prigozhin and the war in Ukraine
From the moment Yevgeny Prigozhin's mutiny in Russia collapsed two months ago there was always a sense that a man who had lived so close to the edge for so long had overplayed his hand.
Assuming he was on board his own private jet when it went down en route from Moscow to St Petersburg, this was a shocking and violent end to a very turbulent life. 
For so many years Vladimir Putin was able to call on Prigozhin's services.
But the botched revolt involving thousands of Wagner mercenaries went beyond the pale. President Putin condemned the rebellion as ""treason"" and it was soon very clear that Prigozhin's prolific role in Russia was over. 
This was a man whose first years of adulthood were spent in a St Petersburg jail, but he thrived in the 1990s with catering businesses that brought him wealth and patronage from Mr Putin himself. 
It was Prigozhin's mercenary ventures in Africa, Syria and Ukraine that made him a military figure but the dynamic changed when Russia unleashed war in Ukraine and the president's one-time chef found power as well as wealth.
Unconfirmed reports suggest his Embraer Legacy plane was hit by two bursts of fire from military air defences. 
If it was brought down deliberately, few will be surprised because Prigozhin had no shortage of enemies. Dmitry Utkin, who was Prigozhin's first Wagner commander, was also on the passenger list.
Prigozhin, 62, appeared to have escaped punishment for his short-lived mutiny against the Kremlin. 
Under a deal to end the revolt many of his rebel mercenaries were allowed to go to a camp in Belarus while the Wagner boss himself was able to travel within Russia, showing up in St Petersburg in casual clothes during a Russian summit of African leaders in late July.
His witty but venomous video rants against the failings of the Russian defence establishment came to an end and state-run TV broadcast footage of raids on his luxurious home outside St Petersburg.
But Prigozhin was never going to slink off quietly to a bolthole in Belarus and it was only this week that his first video address since the botched mutiny surfaced. 
The desert background indicated it had been shot in Africa and, clad in combat gear, Prigozhin declared that the temperature was 50C and his Wagner group was recruiting to make Russia ""even greater on all continents, and Africa even more free"".
Prigozhin appeared to be reverting to the mercenary roots he put down several years ago when he set up the Wagner private military company, which helped prop up Russian allies in the Central African Republic and Syria, and challenged French influence in Mali.
Although he denied it for years, Prigozhin also founded a so-called troll-factory of pro-Kremlin bloggers in a non-descript office in St Petersburg. His Internet Research Agency was blamed by the US for using information warfare to meddle in the 2016 presidential election.
Prigozhin admitted this year to coming up with the whole idea: ""It was created to protect the Russian information space from the West's boorish and aggressive anti-Russian propaganda.""
He had spent almost a decade in the final years of the Soviet era in jail for robbery and fraud. But as the new Russia shrugged off its Soviet past, Prigozhin went into catering, first as a hotdog-seller and then moving on to more sophisticated dining, opening some of St Petersburg's more chic restaurants.
Mr Putin, then the city's deputy mayor, took notice. ""Vladimir Putin saw how I built a business out of a kiosk,"" he said years later.
After he became president, Mr Putin entertained global leaders such as France's Jacques Chirac in Prigozhin's restaurants. The up-and-coming caterer earned the sobriquet ""Putin's chef"".
If Prigozhin's mercenary business was later to give him military clout and money, his catering business would supply him with a constant stream of wealth right up to this year. 
President Putin revealed shortly after the botched Wagner revolt that Prigozhin's private army had been fully funded with $1bn from the state over 12 months, while a further $1bn went to Prigozhin's Concord catering firm for feeding the military.
But that was just over one year, and reports suggest he had received more than $18bn in government contracts since 2014.
Kremlin propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov said big money had made Prigozhin go ""off the rails"" but it was his men's battlefield exploits that had gained him a sense of impunity.
""He thought he could challenge the defence ministry, the state itself and the president personally.""
That all came to a head as Russia's military campaign in Ukraine faltered last year and Prigozhin's Wagner fighters spearheaded a bloody campaign to seize the eastern city of Bakhmut.
Last September Prigozhin toured prisons around Russia offering inmates the chance to commute their sentences in exchange for service with Wagner.
Thousands died in the fight for Bakhmut, many of them inexperienced, badly armed former prisoners. 
As the battle reached a climax, Prigozhin appeared in social media videos demanding ammunition, standing among bodies of dead mercenaries.
He reserved his loathing for President Putin's loyal defence minister Sergei Shoigu and the armed forces chief Valery Gerasimov.
""Shoigu! Gerasimov! Where is the... ammunition?... They came here as volunteers and die for you to fatten yourselves in your mahogany offices.""
Prigozhin steered clear of directly criticising the president, always blaming his commanders instead. 
But when the military chiefs announced plans to bring the Wagner forces and other ""voluntary detachments"" under the main command structure, Prigozhin appeared to snap.
As he prepared to launch his ""march for justice"", he called into question the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and accused the defence minister of responsibility for the deaths of thousands of Russian soldiers.
The Kremlin denounced as ""hysteria"" suggestions that Prigozhin's revolt had dented Vladimir Putin's hold on power.
At the very least it was the beginning of the end of Prigozhin's extraordinary and long-lived Russian influence over the Putin leadership.

Sara Sharif death: Girl seen with injuries at school - neighbour,"A 10-year-old girl was seen in school with cuts and bruises to her face months before she was found dead at her home, a neighbour has said.
The woman learned about the injuries to Sara Sharif from her own daughter, who was one of the girl's classmates.
Sara's father, his brother and his partner flew to Pakistan before Sara was found in Woking, Surrey, on 10 August.
Post-mortem tests found Sara sustained ""multiple and extensive injuries"".
The former neighbour, who asked only to be identified as Jessica, told the BBC Sara had been a happy and confident child who always skipped to school.
But after Sara was found dead, Jessica's daughter told her mother that in April Sara had gone to St Mary's primary school in Byfleet with clearly visible injuries.
""Just before the Easter holidays she was in school and had cuts and bruises on her face and her neck,"" Jessica said. 
""My daughter had asked what had happened and she said she'd fallen off a bike and then kind of walked away. 
""The next day the teacher announced she had left school and she was being home-schooled.""
She said it was about that time that the Sharif family moved to Woking, about a 20-minute drive away.
Jessica said she never saw Sara at the school again and neighbours in Woking also said they did not see the child go to school.
Earlier, another neighbour said Sara had been removed from school and was being educated at home.
The woman, who did not want to be named, told the BBC that Sara's father's partner, Beinash Batool, had told her the girl was being home schooled after being bullied for wearing a hijab.
""I suggested to Beinash that Sara needed to be with children her own age,"" said the neighbour. ""She replied that she was making friends at the mosque and in her swimming lessons.
""Another time I remarked to Beinash that it must be difficult to home school Sara, especially as she had the baby to look after. She said it was very easy as she used BBC Bitesize.""
The neighbour said Sara seemed a ""reserved and quiet"" child.
""She often carried the baby in her arms, and sometimes I saw her playing with him. I never saw her smile or laugh.""
Surrey Police officers are working with the authorities in Pakistan to locate Ms Batool, Sara's father Urfan Sharif and his brother Faisal Malik.
Surrey County Council and police have confirmed the authorities had contact with the family, with the police describing their interaction as ""limited"" and ""historic"".
A post-mortem examination failed to establish the exact cause of Sara's death, with more tests being carried out.

Zimbabwe election: Delays mar vote with large turnout,"Large numbers of Zimbabweans turned out to vote in a general election, amid some delays, following a campaign dominated by soaring inflation.
The process was largely peaceful, but the main opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) reported that some polling stations had failed to open as the official closing time approached.
Its candidate, Nelson Chamisa, has alleged there was ""voter suppression"".
Mr Chamisa is one of 10 challengers to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.
Officials have five days to announce the results.
A presidential candidate needs more than 50% of the vote to win.
If there is no outright victor, a presidential run-off will be held in six weeks on 2 October, when the more than six million registered voters will choose between the top two candidates.
Zimbabweans were also electing MPs and local councillors.
Long queues formed well before the polling stations opened with people saying they were excited to exercise their right to vote.
Some had to wait for more than eight hours for ballot papers to arrive. Others left out of frustration.  
The delays in the capital, Harare, which is an opposition stronghold, could further tarnish what is already a controversial election.
After voting on Wednesday, one Harare resident spoke about the harsh economic climate.
""I want my life to improve, for the economy to be fixed, for my children to be able to go to school, healthcare to work. That is what we are voting for - for these things to be fixed,"" she told the BBC. 
A young male voter said he wanted ""improvement in this country in terms of infrastructure... we are just expecting something better than what we are now"".
The delays at some polling stations have been blamed on the late delivery of ballot papers, caused by legal challenges by some of those running for local council seats.
The electoral commission says 23% of polling stations opened on time at 07:00 local time (07:00 GMT) in Harare. In the second city, Bulawayo, 75% were open by 08:00, officials have said. 
Voting was due to end at 19:00 but the commission says that the hours will be extended in those places that started late.
Some voters in Harare told the BBC that they had not been able to find their polling stations.
President Mnangagwa cast his vote in Kwekwe, 175km (110 miles) south-west of Harare, saying he was confident of winning.
""If I think I'm not going to take it then I'd be foolish. Everyone who contests, if you are going to race, you are going to race to win and it's precisely what I'm doing,"" he told reporters.
After voting in Harare, Mr Chamisa said that there was ""going to be a new government in this country... we are winning this election"".
He also alleged that the authorities were ""panicking"", adding that the delays were happening in urban areas where the CCC has most of its support.
Later he told journalists that there had been ""Stone Age, antiquated, analogue rigging"".
His party members have also said that fake leaflets have been distributed claiming to be produced by the CCC urging people to boycott the poll.
It is first election since the death of Robert Mugabe, the man who dominated Zimbabwean politics and the ruling Zanu-PF party for decades.
He died in 2019 nearly two years after he was toppled in a military takeover and replaced by Mr Mnangagwa, his deputy.
In the last election in 2018, Mr Mnangagwa won in the first round with 51% of the vote. Mr Chamisa came second with 45%  and unsuccessfully challenged the result in court.
Police had been deployed around the country to maintain order, and their numbers would be bolstered by prison officers, police chief Godwin Matanga said ahead of the poll.
He maintained the pre-election period had been largely peaceful despite some skirmishes.
However, opposition parties say a disproportionate number of their rallies were banned by police or disrupted.
One CCC supporter was killed in violence earlier the month. Police have arrested 15 suspects in connection with the case.
Monitoring groups have raised issues about alleged anomalies on the voters' roll, saying some names have been moved from their usual place of voting to other areas.
There has also been criticism about last-minute boundary changes, meaning voters may not know their assigned polling station has changed. 
Mr Mnangagwa is anxious to get an international stamp of approval for the vote so Zimbabwe's foreign debt can be restructured and potentially open up fresh lines of credit frozen more than 20 years ago.
He has struggled to contain roller-coaster inflation, which was in the single digits in late 2017. The annual rate reached 176% in June with figures out this week showing it has dipped to 77.2% from 101.3% in July.
Zanu-PF did not produce a manifesto, saying the president's work speaks for itself, with a boom in mining and big investments in infrastructure.
But the CCC says ordinary people have not benefited, with one in four Zimbabweans out of regular work. Mr Chamisa says he plans to scrap the volatile local currency if he wins.

"Trump, Tucker Carlson and a shared hostility to Fox News","Donald Trump is not just skipping the first Republican primary debate in Milwaukee on Wednesday night, he is actively counter-programming it.
The former president sat down for a pre-recorded interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that will be streamed on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, during the first hour of the two-hour Republican debate.
Trump and Carlson make for strange bedfellows, as the former president and the once-popular conservative commentator have had a sometimes complicated relationship. Their interests align, however, in sticking it to Fox News, the conservative cable network that is airing the Republican debate.
Fox abruptly dismissed Mr Carlson from his hugely popular evening politics show in April after documents from a lawsuit against Fox by Dominion Voting Systems showed the host repeatedly disparaging Fox executives and other network employees in text messages and emails.
Mr Carlson was also highly critical of Mr Trump in some of those disclosed communications, saying he ""passionately hated"" the then-president and that his time in the White House had been a ""disaster"". 
Mr Trump, for his part, has a long history of clashes with Fox News, starting with what he thought was unfair treatment by the network's moderators in the first debate of the 2016 primary election season. Since he launched his latest bid for the White House, Mr Trump has repeatedly said Fox News executives have been biased against him, favouring Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's presidential campaign over his.
In this case, the enemy of Mr Trump's enemy may not necessarily be his friend, but Mr Carlson - and his streaming show - is providing a mutually beneficial way to draw attention away from Mr Trump's presidential rivals while also damaging Fox News. 
The former president is touting the Tucker appearance on his own social media site - he has yet to return to Twitter despite Elon Musk lifting his ban - hinting that the interview won't necessarily be a cordial affair.
""Sparks will fly,"" he posted on Wednesday.
That would serve the purposes of both Mr Carlson and Mr Trump, who may be hoping their own drama outshines whatever takes place on the Fox debate stage on Wednesday night.

No indication Prigozhin plane hit by surface-to-air missile - US,"

More than 24 hours after a plane linked to Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin came down in Russia, there remain plenty of questions. 
What caused the crash? And do we even know for sure that Prigozhin was on board? The US says it's ""likely"" he was - but when he finally spoke about the crash - some 24 hours later - Russian President Vladimir Putin chose his words carefully.
The post below tells you what we do know. We're pausing our live coverage - for now, at least.
My thanks to all my colleagues in London and Singapore who've kept this coverage rolling for more than 24 hours. 
It's more than a
day after a private jet crashed near Moscow - killing ten people, who reportedly included Wagner leader
Yevgeny Prigozhin. 
Information is still emerging - but here are the key things we do know.
1. Prigozhin was ""likely"" killed
US officials are among those who think it's ""likely"" the Wagner leader was on board the crashed
plane. But there's still been no explicit confirmation of this, as you'll see from our earlier post analysing the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin. We know that Prigozhin was on the
passenger list that was released by Russian air officials soon after the incident.
2. An explosion possibly caused the crash
Various
theories have emerged as to what brought the plane down. It has been reported that a
surface-to-air missile may have struck the plane, but the Pentagon has said it has no indication that one was used. A US official has told the BBC’s US partner network CBS that an explosion on
board was a more probable cause - and that it was possible a bomb went off.
3. The blame game continues
Fingers have been pointed at members of the Russian leadership, thought there is no proof that any of them were involved. Breaking his silence on the incident, Putin called it a “tragedy” and reiterated that an investigation
was under way. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his
country had nothing to do with the crash.
4. The circumstances
of the crash
We know
that the aircraft - an Embraer-135
(EBM-135BJ) - was flying from Moscow to St Petersburg on Wednesday. It had seven
passengers and three crew, according to Russia's aviation authority. The plane come
down near the village of Kuzhenkino, about halfway between Moscow and St
Petersburg. All 10 people on board were killed.
Here's another of today's important developments relating to the Ukraine war. 
The US has announced it is sanctioning
11 individuals and two organisations over the alleged forced transfer and
deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children.
The US ambassador
to the UN said the White House would also seek to impose visa restrictions on three Russia-installed
“authorities”.
Linda Thomas-Greenfield also said the
US was aware of reports that hundreds of children have been moved from
Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine to Belarus in the past year.
Newsnight
Although this live coverage will wrap up soon, audiences in the UK can tune into Newsnight for more on this story.
Ukraine's deputy minister of defence has told the programme that the Wagner mercenary
group will struggle without the leadership of Yevgeny Prigozhin.
The group has been instrumental in Russia’s war against
Ukraine, but was split up following the failed rebellion in June - with fighters
told they could either join the regular army or go to Belarus.
Volodymyr Havrylov also told Newsnight that Prigozhin was a “very symbolic, charismatic
leader”, who his fighters – many of whom were recruited from prisons – “really accepted”.
He says without Prigozhin, Wagner’s fighters will lose confidence
and morale, especially in the lower ranks. He adds: “They don't understand what to do next.”

The violent demise of Yevgeny
Prigozhin, if confirmed, will not be mourned in Kyiv. Nor in Aleppo. Nor in a
village in Mali where human rights groups allege Wagner troops carried out a
massacre of hundreds of civilians.
Eight years since Wagner was founded, the mercenary group has earned itself a fearsome reputation for brutality
both on and off the battlefield. 
In the short term, Wagner now lack both
leadership and direction. But they have proved themselves over time to be a
valuable tool for the Kremlin, a weapon which Moscow will want to see replicated
before it is lost.

Rustam Karimov - mentioned below - was one of ten people reported to have been on board a plane in Russia that crashed yesterday. Flight details released by Russian authorities state that Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was among the others. 
They are said to have been joined by Dmitry Utkin, who is believed to have given the mercenary group its name.
The 63-year-old is thought to have been involved in the private army since its early days in 2014, though his exact role is disputed.
In his last known remarks - made to Wagner troops in Belarus in June and reported by a pro-Wagner social media channel - he seemed to confirm that the group was named after the call sign he used on the battlefield.
Click here for more on what we know about the group that were purportedly on board the plane.
A woman who's identified herself as the widow of the crashed plane's co-pilot has written about her grief.
""I don't know how I can handle it,"" the wife of Rustam Karimov earlier wrote on social media.
""It has never been so hard; it feels like I'm just a body without emotions, feelings, without the desire of any,"" she added, in remarks that were reported by our colleagues at BBC Russian.
Someone pointing the finger of blame at the Russian leadership is jailed opposition leader
Alexei Navalny.
He says President Vladimir Putin has turned Yevgeny
Prigozhin - and the other Wagner fighters who are thought to have died in Wednesday’s
plane crash - into ""martyrs"". 
In a new blog post, Navalny – who recently
had his jail term extended to nearly 19 years – says Prigozhin is a hero in the eyes of Wagner supporters. He says  Putin could not stomach this.
“The traitor and coward
is Putin in his Kremlin who envies the popularity of these Russian heroes in
the people's eyes and the army and hates them for it,” writes Navalny. “So he gave the vile
order to kill them.” 
Navalny - who survived a poisoning in 2020 - warns that “these are the ingredients used to create the dish
called ‘civil war’.”
It's worth us reiterating that there's been no confirmation of what caused the plane to crash - an incident labelled by Putin as a ""tragedy"" that's under investigation.
A US official has said it seems “very unlikely” Yevgeny Prigozhin’s plane was shot down by a
surface-to-air missile - a view that's consistent with what we just heard in the Pentagon briefing.
The official told the BBC's American partner network CBS that an explosion on
board the aircraft was the more probable cause of Wednesday's crash.
They added that the cause of
that explosion was not yet known, but a bomb was one possibility.
The plane presumed to have been carrying Yevgeny Prigozhin may have fallen out of the sky by accident, but it's ""much more likely"" to have been brought down deliberately, explains the BBC's Analysis Editor Ros Atkins.
Watch as Ros examines the four possible causes of yesterday's incident in his latest video.
For their part, US officials in the Pentagon have now said they heave no information to suggest a surface-to-air missile was responsible.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that an investigation was under way, which he warned would take ""some time"". 
Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder did not given a full operational
update on Ukraine during his briefing a short time ago. But he did say that Ukraine was continuing to “get
after it” and pursue its counter-offensive against Russian invaders.
He said the Ukrainians were making some progress along the front line but that their mission remained tough for various reasons, including the need to navigate
minefields.
“Our focus is going to be on consulting with them and ensuring
they have what they need to be successful”, he said.
Patrick Ryder just said at the Pentagon briefing that there was no information to indicate a surface-to-air missile brought down Prigozhin's plane - contrary to earlier reports by some outlets. 
But what exactly are the missiles under discussion?
Often abbreviated to SAM, a surface-to-air missile is designed to be launched from the ground to destroy aircraft, among other objects. 
It can be fired from land or sea towards other missiles or even aircraft.
Brig Gen Ryder is asked by a reporter what to expect next for the mercenary group's leadership.
""I'd refer you to the Wagner group, if you're able to get in touch with them, for any questions on what their current business model and path forward is,"" he replies.
""We've seen the Russian government, shortly after the events near Moscow two months ago, say to some of these members: 'Sign a contract with the ministry of defence.'
""We're aware that some members of Wagner left and others stayed, but, as it relates to the future of this company, this mercenary company, I really don't have anything to provide,"" he adds.
The Pentagon says English-language training for Ukrainians on how to operate F-16 fighter jets will begin in Texas in September. Flight training is expected to begin the following month in Arizona.
Spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder says the Pentagon does not currently know exactly how many Ukrainians will
be taking part in this training, but that it's
thought that several pilots and dozens of maintenance workers will be included.
His comments come as a coalition of other Western allies prepare to start training Ukrainians
later this month. 
Ryder says the US training will “complement” this training and the US will remain in “close consultation” with its European allies about the
requirements for F-16 pilots. 
The American decision earlier this year to supply Ukraine with F-16 jets represented an about-turn.
This is because the US and its allies - who had earlier ruled out the move - had feared this would lead to further escalation with a nuclear-armed Russia.
Brig Gen Ryder has just been asked repeatedly about the Pentagon's capabilities to track movements of the Wagner paramilitary group.
He says he is not in a position to comment on US intelligence.
But he does stress to reporters in the briefing room that Wagner is a much greater threat than Prigozhin alone.
More now from Brig Gen Patrick Ryder, who's asked ""what next"" for the Wagner group.
He's also asked about the repercussions Prigozhin's reported death could have on the war in Ukraine.
Ryder says Wagner is ""no longer"" in the battlefield in Ukraine, following its short-lived mutiny against the Russian military leadership in June.
He explains that the mercenary group's troops were Russia's ""most effective forces on the battlefield"", but their influence is now greatly diminished.
Ryder adds that many Wagner members are now in Belarus, providing training to Belarusian troops. 
A pact with Belarus was one of the key conditions after Wagner's failed uprising two months ago.
US Defense Department spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder is now addressing members of the media at a Pentagon briefing.
Asked about the Wagner leader, Gen Ryder says that the initial assessment from the Pentagon is that Yevgeny Prigozhin was ""likely killed"" in the plane crash.
He says there is no information to indicate that a surface-to-air missile brought down the plane and will not be drawn on what other reason could have caused the crash.
Today is Ukraine's Independence Day, and crowds around the world have been marking the occasion.
It's 32 years since Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union. Here are some of the pictures we've been seeing from different countries:
You can now listen to tonight's episode of Ukrainecast on BBC Sounds. The team has been speaking to the man who calls himself the number one enemy of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
American-born British financier Bill Browder tells our chief international correspondent Lyse
Doucet and BBC Monitoring's Russia editor Vitaly Shevchenko that the presumed death of Yevgeny Prigozhin is
""the beginning of the purge"". 
He says Prigozhin’s decision to fly on a private
aircraft in Russia was ""reckless"", and also describes the security precautions
he takes himself as a marked man.
A reminder that the BBC has not verified that Prigozhin was on board the plane. And it remains unclear why the vehicle crashed.
A short while ago, we heard Russian President Vladimir Putin hail the ""talented businessman"" Yevgeny Prigozhin, who's presumed to have died in yesterday's plane crash.
Members of the Russian public have been adding their own contributions to memorials created in memory of Prigozhin and his associates outside Wagner offices.

‘Chinese spy’ targeted thousands over LinkedIn,"A Chinese spy is alleged to have used LinkedIn to contact thousands of British officials and lure them into handing over state secrets. 
The Times said that the spy worked for Beijing's Ministry of State Security and used a series of false names.
The MI5 has previously warned that spies are using LinkedIn to target those with access to confidential information.
The Chinese Embassy has been contacted for comment.
A parliamentary report also warned that the aim was sometimes to lure people to China and then compromise them.
The alleged spy is said to have used several names over a period of five years. The most prominent used was Robin Zhang, 
During that time it is claimed he offered British and other officials business opportunities, with an endgame of gaining sensitive information from them. 
He is also said to have offered a recruitment consultant up to £8,000 each time they handed over details of someone who worked for the intelligence services. 
Some of the targets were said to have been offered trips to China and paid speaking engagements. 
Others were asked to provide reports, which the alleged spy would then use to request more confidential documents with the aim of entrapment.
A recent report by the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee on China detailed the potential ways in which such contacts could be exploited. 
In evidence to the committee, an officer from MI6, the UK's secret intelligence service, suggested this could involve trying to compromise targets who agreed to travel. 
""Once they get you back to China, if you have shown vulnerability to them, they will absolutely do all the usual gamut of blackmail,"" the agent said.
They added this could include ""honey-trapping, where they try and catch you in a sexually compromising position. They will do all of that"".
The investigation by the Times says ""Robin Zhang"" is believed to work inside China. 
It says that those who he engaged with - who worked in a variety of areas including the military and think-tanks - often found him ""pushy"".
The company details Zhang provided were ""vague"", the Times added.
Zhang's main account is now believed to have been deleted.
There have been growing warnings in recent years about the risks of LinkedIn being used for espionage. 
In 2021, Britain's domestic security service MI5 said at least 10,000 UK nationals had been contacted by fake profiles linked to hostile states in the previous five years. 
""Malicious profiles"" are being used on ""an industrial scale"", said the security service's head, Ken McCallum. The service launched a Think Before You Link campaign about the risks.
Germany and the US are among other states that have also issued similar warnings. 
In 2019, a former CIA officer, Kevin Mallory, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for passing secrets to China following contact on LinkedIn.
LinkedIn says it actively seeks out signs of state-sponsored activity and removes fake accounts.

Ukraine war: Brit was killed while trying to rescue Ukrainians - inquest,"A British father died from head and chest injuries while fighting with the Ukrainian army, an inquest has heard.
Simon Lingard, 38, died at about 12:00 GMT on 7 November 2022 in Bakhmut in the Donetsk region in east Ukraine.
The ex-paratrooper, from Preston, died after being struck by fragments from artillery fire while trying to rescue Ukrainians after fighting broke out.
Following the inquest, his ex-partner Stacey Longworth said he was ""an amazing dad and not just a soldier"".
""There's a lot of people that don't agree with what Simon did and have voiced opinions but his family are unbelievably proud of him and we backed him every step of the way,"" she added.
Jackson Lingard, Mr Lingard's son, said: ""He was a person outside the military.
""He was a big charity man but he was also loved by everyone, as well as [being] our dad too.""
In a statement read by Coroner Darren Salter at Oxford Coroner's Court, Ms Longworth said Mr Lingard joined the British Army when he was 16.
She said he was medically discharged because of a knee injury, then he wanted to re-join when they broke up.
The inquest heard Mr Lingard was recruited by the paratroopers and was in the Army for two or three years before he left and got a job as a mental health support worker.
Mr Lingard set up a charity with two others which helped people who struggled with their mental health and also worked as a landscape gardener while training to become a social worker.
In her statement, Ms Longworth said her ex-partner had been out to Ukraine and then returned to see his children before returning to the war-torn country in August or September 2022.
The Monday before he died he had spoken to his family, she said, and he had said he was going to the front line for the last time and would be back the week after. 
Ms Longworth added: ""He was loving life in Ukraine and was considering living there after the war, sending videos of him singing with the locals.""
At 19:00 on 7 November 2022, Ms Longworth had a call from Mr Lingard's friend in Ukraine who told her he had been killed while fighting.
She was told the friend personally carried Mr Lingard's body back.
The unit's sergeant told her what a ""brave man"" he was and explained how he had been trying to rescue Ukrainians when he was killed, she added.  
Following a post-mortem examination, Mr Lingard's cause of death was given as penetrating fragment injuries to the head and chest, by Dr Russell Delaney, Home Office forensic pathologist.
Dr Delaney said he would have expected Mr Lingard's injuries to have resulted in ""instant unconsciousness"" and that death ""would have followed rapidly as a consequence of brain injury and blood loss from chest injury"".
The cause of death given by authorities in Ukraine was damage due to the action of explosion and fragments.
Mr Lingard was identified using dental records on 8 December 2022.
Mr Salter said it was apparent Mr Lingard was a ""popular person"" by the number of his friends who attended the inquest via an online link.
He added: ""What we know is Simon volunteered, he had military experience and Simon volunteered to serve with the Ukrainian army and he did so returning to the UK on certainly one or two occasions before returning again a few months before his death.
""It sounds like he was due to return to the UK shortly but very sadly on this occasion, although we don't have precise details, evidence indicates he was in service with his unit in Bakhmut when he was struck by the fragments from artillery fire which sadly, due to the severity of his injuries, caused his death.""
Mr Salter gave a narrative conclusion saying Mr Lingard was ""killed whilst on active service with the international legion of the Ukrainian army"".

India bridge collapse: At least 26 killed at construction site,"This video can not be played
Watch: Scenes from the Sairang bridge collapse
At least 26 people have been killed and more are feared missing after a railway bridge under construction collapsed in north-eastern India, officials said.
The incident occurred near the town of Sairang, in the state of Mizoram.
Up to 40 workers were at the site when part of the bridge collapsed, according to local media reports.
The cause of the incident is not yet clear and the railway authority has opened an investigation. Three people have so far been rescued.
That includes an injured worker who had to be brought down from the top of one of the bridge's 100m-high (328ft) pillars. 
The incident happened over the Kurung River, about 20km (12 miles) from the city of Aizawl, Mizoram's capital. 
""All possible assistance is being given to those affected,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office in a statement.  
The government will pay some 200,000 rupees (£1,900; $2,400) to the next of kin of those killed, it added.
The victims are all from West Bengal, according to railway officials. 
""Words cannot express the depth of sorrow and sympathy for the families affected by this tragic event,"" said Mizoram's Home Minister Lalchamliana. 
The Khamrang-Sihhmui railway line will be 51km long and is due to be completed in December after work began nearly two years ago. 
Accidents on these kinds of construction sites are not uncommon in India.
In October last year, more than 140 people were killed when a pedestrian suspension bridge collapsed in India's western state of Gujarat.

Eight candidates have made their case to be the Republican presidential candidate for 2024.
It was not a calm and civil debate, there were fiery clashes across multiple topics. 
Over the coming days, we're likely to see the candidates tout their own performances in the debate, and continue to spar on the key issues including the economy, crime, immigration and the border.
We're also likely to hear more from the party's front-runner - Donald Trump - who was not in attendance. 
Instead, he appeared in an interview with Tucker Carlson on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Trump's shadow loomed over the debate, but perhaps not as large as many thought it would.
You can read more analysis on the winners and losers of the debate here.
Thanks for joining us.
Despite his position at one end of the row of candidates on stage, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson’s campaign feels strong about his performance. 
“I think this is what America is looking for,” Tim Coonan, Iowa chair of Asa for America, told the BBC after the debate. 
“This is the biggest audience he's been in front of… I think he made a case for himself. Today was an introduction to a lot of people who may have heard of him but never seen him.” 
Coonan isn’t worried the governor stood by his previous comments about former President Donald Trump not being fit for office again, despite Trump’s large lead in the polls. 
“Governor Hutchinson is also a former federal prosecutor and a lifetime attorney, and his read is that Donald Trump cannot be the candidate because he is in violation of the 14th amendment. He's disqualified. And so I think for him, it's a black and white issue.”
Anthony Zurcher
BBC North America correspondent in Wisconsin
Ron DeSantis:
He was on the side-lines for all the key moments of the debate. Vivek Ramaswamy ran circles around him. Other candidates, like Pence and Haley, elbowed him out of the way on issues like abortion and US aid to Ukraine. He seemed on uneven footing when the topic turned to Donald Trump and his recent indictments.
This was not the stabilising performance DeSantis needed. The man who was once billed as the future of the Republican Party was simply a non-factor.
Asa Hutchinson and Doug Burgum:
Former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson was the last candidate to qualify for the Milwaukee debate. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum elbowed his way onto the stage with a gimmick - offering enough people $20 gift cards if they donated $1 to his campaign.
Both candidates desperately needed to show that they deserved to be on the stage, and both candidates were mostly afterthoughts.
Hutchinson's criticisms of Trump seemed weak sauce compared to Christie's more pointed attacks. And Burgum's awe-shucks small-state conservatism never really stood out.
The qualification standards become more rigorous for next month's primary debate in California, and neither candidate did enough on Wednesday night to build the kind of support they will need to make another appearances on the debate stage likely.

Anthony Zurcher
BBC North America correspondent in Wisconsin
Vivek Ramaswamy:
The man who never ran for public office - and didn't even vote for a president from 2004 to 2020 - simply dominated this Republican debate.
""I'm the only person on the stage who isn't bought and paid for,"" he said during a discussion of climate change - prompting cries of outrage from his rivals.
Nikki Haley:
She stood out by offering sharp criticism early of both Donald Trump and the Republican Party as a whole.
Haley showed sharp elbows. She mixed it up with Ramaswamy on continued US aid to Ukraine, which she supports. And she clashed with Mike Pence on abortion, calling his demands for a national abortion ban as unrealistic and politically damaging.
Mike Pence:
The veteran politician, who has served as a congressman, a governor and a vice-president, has a bit of fight left in him.
He offered a passionate, religion-based call for nationwide abortion limits. And while that likely won't play well in next year's general election, it could help him win over evangelical Republicans who can tilt the balance in states like Iowa and South Carolina, which have an outsized role in deciding the party nominee.

Vice President Kamala Harris has issued a statement about tonight's Republican debate, arguing that none of the candidates on stage ""won"". 
""Instead, the American people heard how much they stand to lose from an extremist agenda,"" the statement added. 
""One by one, each extremist Republican candidate laid out a vision for an America that is less fair, less free and less safe"". 
Specifically, Harris said that the Republican candidates would ""benefit special interests and the ultra-wealthy"", gut social security, step away ""fundamental right and basic freedoms"" and reverse Joe Biden's economic policies. 
""These extremists focus on unnecessary debates meant to divide our nation in hopes that the American public will not notice that they have no affirmative agenda,"" the statement said. 
Sam Cabral
Reporting from Milwaukee
Staffers with the Vivek Ramaswamy campaign are effusively declaring that he “won” tonight’s debate.
“Seven career politicians came at him with 30-year-old talking points, and he held his own and won hands down,” says the campaign’s senior adviser Chris Grant inside the spin room.
“The reason why he’s such a threat to these establishment guys is because he actually has a vision for the future, he’s not worried about saving his political career.” 
Grant said Ramaswamy’s message had struck a chord in Iowa. 
“He tells people exactly what he thinks and believes, and it’s refreshing.”
US President Joe Biden tweeted three times during the debate. 
In the first tweet - which came early in the event - he said that ""climate change is real, by the way"".
The message on X, formerly Twitter, came after the Republican candidates weighed in on the climate issue. 
Vivek Ramaswamy referred to the ""climate change agenda"" as a ""hoax"". 
Later on, Biden tweeted again, this time featuring a video of the Nikki Haley on stage remarking that ""Donald Trump added $8 billion to our debt"". 
""What she said,"" Biden tweeted.
His third and final tweet included a link through which supporters can donate to his campaign. 
""You know, my Dad used to say: 'Don’t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative,' So, tonight, compare me to the alternative. And then donate,"" he said. 
Sam Cabral
Reporting from Milwaukee
When moderators brought up “the elephant not in the room”, the crowd grew extremely animated.
To a loud mixture of boos and cheers, Chris Christie and Vivek Ramaswamy tangled over whether or not Donald Trump was being persecuted by his political opponents.
“Booing is allowed, but it doesn’t change the truth” about Trump, Christie said, as the audience jeered at him loudly.
Hutchinson drew increasingly loud boos as he explained his belief that Trump was “disqualified” from the presidency.
Sam Cabral
Reporting from Milwaukee
I'm in the spin room now, where Mike Pence has just dismissed suggestions that he was combative on the stage. 
“I was just standing up for the conservative agenda,” he told reporters. 
“I saw people on the stage who were just wrong about American leadership, wrong on policy and it was important to call it out.” 
He said he “seized every opportunity I could to draw those contrasts”.
Mike Wendling
US reporter
Ron DeSantis drew applause for brandishing his pro-life credentials. 
""What the Democrats are trying to do on this issue is wrong,
to allow abortion up to the moment of birth,"" he said. ""We will hold them accountable for their extremism."" 
But is this a fair depiction? 
The idea that Democrats support abortion at any time during a pregnancy stems from a proposed bill. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act - which has not become law - includes a provision allowing late-term abortion if the health of the mother is at risk. 
Republicans have used that clause to support their claims. But experts say late-term abortion is rare. The bill would not automatically make it legal until the moment of birth - nor do Democratic politicians support such a move. 
The two-hour long debate in Milwaukee was fiery, with the candidates clashing on multiple topics. Frontrunner Donald Trump chose to skip the debate, instead talking to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on X (formerly known as Twitter).
Here are some of the key moments:
The candidates have made their closing statements and the debate is now over. 
But stick with us as we dig into more analysis and talk about who the biggest winners and losers of the night were.
Christie was asked asked ""the UFO question"" - eliciting laughs from the candidate and the crowd alike. 
""I get the UFO question? Come on,"" he said. 
He pivoted away from the question, however, using the UFOs to highlight ""honesty"" in the US government and criticism of teachers union. 
The question, and Christie's initial response, appear to be a favourite among those watching the debate and commenting on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. 
As many observers predicted, the US-Mexico border has repeatedly come up during the debate. It's an issue that often comes up as a key issue in polls of Republican voters. 
DeSantis said he would deploy the US military to the southern border to use force, leaving drug smugglers ""stone cold dead"". 
He also repeated a common refrain of his from the past few months, said he would send US special forces into Mexico to ""re-establish the rule of law"" at the border. 
""As president, would I use force? Would I treat them as foreign terrorist organisations? You're darn right I would,"" he said. 
Scott called on additional money to be spent at the border, both for the hiring of more personnel and for technologies. 
Hutchinson, a former head of the Drug Enforcement Agency, called on more economic pressure to be placed on Mexico's government to encourage cooperation. 
Pence defended the Trump's administration handling of the border, blaming Biden for unleashing a ""wave"" of fentanyl and human trafficking. 
He also promised to ""partner with the Mexican military"" to hunt down drug cartels. 
Asked about Biden's age, Pence said that presidents ""shouldn't be too old"".
""They shouldn't be too young either,"" he added, a thinly veiled swipe at the 38-year old Ramaswamy. 
In response, the younger candidate said that he believes the US needs a ""new generation"" to ""bring all those voters along"". 
Notably, polls show that a majority of US voters - nearly 70% according to a May poll from ABC and the Washington Post - believe that Biden, 80, is too old for another term. 
Just 44% said the same of Donald Trump, 77. 
The candidates have now been asked about education. 
DeSantis - who often brings up ""woke"" education on the campaign trail - turned to his own handling of education in Florida, where he re-opened schools relatively early in the pandemic. 
""The decline of education is one of the major reasons why our country is in decline,"" he said. ""We need education in this country, not indoctrination"". 
Ramaswamy called for a civics test, similar to that given to naturalised citizens. He also called on the Department of Education to be abolished. 
""We have to remember that education starts with the family, and the nuclear family is the greatest form of governance of all time,"" he added. 
While Haley said ""there's a lot of crazy woke stuff"" happening in the US, she suggested that a more important focus should be reading remediation, and the students should also have vocational classes available to them in schools. 
""Let's teach our students to build things again,"" she said. 
In her own remarks about Ukraine, Haley defended aid for Ukraine, characterising the country as the frontline of a struggle with both Russia and China. 
She also angrily attacked Vladimir Putin, and said he was a ""murderer"" that ""killed Prigozhin"", a reference to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner Group believed to have died in a plane crash in Russia today.

Ukraine has been a growing source of division within the Republican Party, which has been shifting away from the internationalist foreign policy of the George W Bush years to Donald Trump’s America First nationalism.
That division played itself out dramatically on the debate stage, as Vivek Ramaswamy – who has said the US should end military aid to Ukraine – clashed with his more established Republican opponents.
Former vice-president Mike Pence drew comparisons between US support for Ukraine to American efforts to combat the Soviet Union during the Cold War, even echoing an old Cold War refrain: “We achieve peace through strength”.
Then it was former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley’s turn.
“You have no foreign policy experience and it shows,” she told Ramaswamy.
The reality, however, is that recent polls show that Ramaswamy’s view – that the US is giving too much to Ukraine – is one held by the majority of Republican voters. 
The ground is shifting in the party, and candidates like Pence and Haley are going to have to change voters minds if they want the issue to be a winner for their campaigns.
Sam Cabral
Reporting from Milwaukee
Ron DeSantis is in the very centre of this stage, with the rest of the field on either side of him.
But for large portions of this debate, he has seemed practically invisible.
To his immediate left, Vivek Ramaswamy has drawn by far the most fire.
Mike Pence and Chris Christie, both standing to DeSantis’ right, have taken him to task over his statements on the economy, crime and Donald Trump.
Nikki Haley, who is standing to the left of DeSantis, is the latest to attack Ramaswamy, savaging his statements on foreign policy in an argument that nearly escalates into a shouting match.
“You have no foreign policy experience and it shows,” Haley says, as the crowd screams its approval and several stand up to applaud.
It is a sign of how much DeSantis has stumbled in this presidential campaign. After being the most viable Trump alternative for several months, he is playing second fiddle to Ramaswamy in this debate.
Donald Trump's interview, which aired at the same time as the debate, has now finished. 
Before it wrapped up, Tucker Carlson asked the former president about his priorities if he's re-elected.
“The first thing I would do is seal up the border good and
tight except for the people who want to come in legally,” Trump responds. 
The interview ends with Carlson asking about the prospect of
civil war, which prompts Trump to talk about the Capitol riot of 6 January 2021,
emphasising that he told the crowd to “peacefully and patriotically” make their
views known. 
“So do you think it’s possible that there’s open conflict?”
Carlson asks
“I don’t know,” Trump responds. “There’s a level of passion I’ve
never seen and there’s a level of hatred I’ve never seen and that’s probably a
bad combination.”
And so ends a rather wandering interview - which at times resembled more of a chummy chat. 
Trump and Carlson and covered Jeffrey Epstein, environmental policy, China, Trump's debunked election fraud theories and much more.
It was at times baffling and may not have been hugely illuminating, but indications are it's pretty popular - and Trump will no doubt compare raw view figures to the debate's TV ratings.
Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy made a play for top dog - here's who came out ahead.
The first Republican debate saw rivals defend their readiness for the job - and the no-show frontrunner.
The former president and ex-Fox host make for strange bedfellows as they try to upstage TV debate.
Donald Trump's former lawyer faces 13 charges linked to efforts to overturn Mr Trump's 2020 election defeat.
When he turned himself in at Fulton County Jail, the process wasn't the same as his last three arrests.

Greek fires rage after migrant tragedy near border,"Fires that have claimed 20 lives in Greece are still burning out of control in foothills near Athens and the Evros region near the border with Turkey.
Eighteen of those killed are thought to be refugees and migrants who crossed the border recently, hiding in forests north of the city of Alexandroupolis.
Greece has expressed its deepest sorrow for the deaths in the Dadia forest close to the Turkish border. 
For five days, fires have burned near the city and west along the coast.
Firefighters are also trying to stop a fire spreading from the slopes of Mount Parnitha, to the north-west of Athens.
Their efforts are being hindered by strong winds whipping up the flames and searing heat of up to 40C (104F).
The victims were found on Tuesday by the fire service near a shack outside the village of Avantas, to the north of Alexandroupolis.
""Unfortunately, their stay in the Dadia forest proved fatal,"" said government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis, pointing out that the alarm had been raised in the area where they were found and evacuation messages had been sent on the mobile 112 emergency service.
Migrants and refugees trying to reach the European Union face many perils - being beaten, robbed, arrested, forced back across a border, or drowning in the Mediterranean. Now the risks also include a ring of fire in northern Greece.
Fire service spokesman Yiannis Artopios said there had been no reports of missing residents and it is widely assumed those who died had recently crossed Greece's long, snaking border with Turkey along the River Evros.
For many who are desperate to reach EU soil, the river is their gateway and the vast forest on the other side provides cover. 
All the dead were male, and two were minors according to local coroner Pavlos Pavlidis, who said the bodies were found within a 500m (1,640ft) radius, some near a sheep pen. 
Their bodies have been taken to Alexandroupolis for post-mortem examinations. But identifying them will be difficult and authorities will need relatives to come forward. 
One Syrian man told the BBC he fears his 27-year-old cousin died in the blaze as he has been unable to reach him for four days. The cousin was among a group of Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis hoping to follow a well-worn path through the forest.   
The Syrian said they would not have called Greek authorities for help, despite the evacuation order, for fear of being sent back across the border to Turkey.
Greek police say throughout August as many as 900 people a day have tried to get across the border and hundreds of traffickers have been arrested. People smuggling is a big business involving criminal networks.
Overnight at the Ipsala border crossing between Turkey and Greece a group of young men tried to climb on to a lorry waiting to enter Greece. 
One managed to conceal himself by lying flat on the top. The others melted away into the darkness when they were spotted. 
Many residents in the villages around Alexandroupolis are furious, as they believe the fires are caused by migrants who cross the border and hide in the forest before heading inland. 
There is no evidence, though, that this fire in the Dadia forest was caused by migrants. Earlier this week the mayor of Alexandroupolis blamed the fires on a lightning strike during a storm.
A video filmed in the Alexandroupolis area has provoked uproar in Greece after it showed a man ""arresting"" refugees and migrants and locking them in a trailer attached to his car. The man walks around the trailer, accusing the migrants and refugees of trying to burn Greeks. He then opens the door showing several frightened young men.
Police said the man had been arrested, along with two people suspected of helping him. They added that the video had involved the illegal detention of ""13 illegal immigrants of Syrian and Pakistani origin"".
In a separate development, Supreme Court Prosecutor Georgia Adeilini has called for a dual inquiry into the causes of the fires in the Evros region and into alleged incidents of racist violence against migrants that have followed the 18 deaths in the Dadia forest.
On the other side of the border, in the Canakkale province of western Turkey, wildfires have continued for a second day, prompting authorities to evacuate 1,200 residents from 11 villages.
Marine traffic was suspended on Wednesday in the Dardanelles Strait between the Aegean and the Black Sea to allow helicopters and other aircraft to pick up water to fight the flames. 
Fires are still burning in the Dadia forest in north-eastern Greece but the biggest front in the Evros region is now to the west of Alexandroupolis.
The situation on the outskirts of Athens is proving increasingly difficult for firefighters and three nursing homes have been evacuated from the town of Menidi.
Homes have already burned Hasia and Fyli, in the foothills of Mount Parnitha.
Greek officials have called for the evacuation of thousands of people from the big district of Ano Liosia in the north-west of the capital, although many have refused to leave.

West Kelowna fires: 'We want to go home and find out what's still there',"Wildfires have ravaged much of western Canada and some of the hundreds of people displaced have been telling the BBC their fears over what may have been destroyed.
There was a rare sight in the sky over the Canadian twin towns of Kelowna and West Kelowna on Tuesday - the Sun.
For much of the last week the immediate area around Lake Okanagan, in the province of British Columbia, has been shrouded in thick smoke. 
The direct result of hundreds of nearby wildfires, the smoke not only hampered the efforts of firefighters to locate and extinguish seats of fire, it also became a worrisome health hazard.
Among those concerned about air quality and particularly its impact on his six-month-old daughter Elizabeth was Shane - a resident of West Kelowna, queuing patiently to register at the ice-hockey rink-cum-crisis centre on the edge of the town. 
Thankful that the Sun had poked its head through the clouds, alleviating at least one of his worries, Shane had other concerns.
""Friday afternoon, we were evacuated,"" he says as he waits hopefully in line to hear if he can qualify for emergency accommodation. 
""It's tough being at my mother-in-law's because there's no room for me, my fiancé, the kids and the pets. We just keep looking for updates when we can go home and know if everything is still there!""
British Columbia Premier David Eby descended on a civic-run crisis centre after flying in a helicopter over the ravaged countryside surrounding Kelowna. 
Full of praise for firefighters continuing to tackle hundreds of small blazes, Mr Eby said their efforts had saved dozens of homes and businesses in the area.
At a press conference overlooking the gradually improving vista of the Lake and its twin towns, Mr Eby responded to a question from the BBC about the underlying causes of so many wildfires across western Canada this year.
He was unequivocal, speaking as helicopters - able to fly again after the smoke had lifted - doused newly emerging fires.
""The ferocity of the fires and the extent of the burning, not just here in British Columbia but in Greece, Nova Scotia and the United States, are devastating fires clearly linked to human-caused climate change."" 
He continued: ""Our Wildfire Service now has to work year-round because the fire season starts longer and goes on later. We're in the fourth year of drought here in BC, that's making the fires so much worse.""
The devastating wildfires of the last week - more than 1,000 in total - have been some of the worst in Canada's history. 
Firefighting services have been stretched to the limit, huge swathes of land have been consumed by flames and thousands have fled for their lives.
Among those evacuated, in haste and chaos, was local businessman Todd Ramsay. 
Now safe with his family and pets in Vancouver, he described how one of the region's biggest lakes, 2.5km wide in places, was no barrier to the blaze.
""Nobody thought that the fire would jump across the lake,"" says Todd as he recalls the sudden realisation that homes on the ""safe"" eastern side of Lake Okanagan were also in peril. 
""We were sitting on the deck and we could hear what sounded like hail and there were pine cones and pine needles and big chunks of carbon that were still warm falling down on our deck.""

Luck has played its part - some residents and businesses left sprinklers or hoses on to try and save their properties. 
But across the region, hundreds of buildings have been consumed by the fires, although it's a testament to the emergency workers dedication and experience that no lives have been lost.  
The reason for so many wildfires this summer will be debated - but many, like Premier Eby, insist that climate change has to be a factor. 
The almost apocalyptic scenes the residents of British Columbia people have witnessed in recent days are almost certain to become a more regular feature of life in these parts.

Solomon Islands country profile,"The Solomon Islands chain consists of several large volcanic islands to the south-east of Papua New Guinea, as well as outlying islands and atolls. The terrain is mountainous and heavily forested.
More than 90% of the islanders are ethnic Melanesians, but there has been intense and bitter rivalry between the Isatabus on Guadalcanal, the largest island, and migrant Malaitans from the neighbouring island.
The former British protectorate is striving to recover from civil unrest between the groups in 1998-2003 that brought it to the brink of collapse.
An Australian-brokered peace deal was signed in 2000 but lawlessness continued and an Australian-led multinational peacekeeping force deployed to the islands between 2003-2017.
During World War Two, the island of Guadalcanal saw some of the fiercest fighting in the Pacific theatre as the US battled to wrest control of the territory from Japanese occupiers.
Head of state: King Charles III, represented by a governor-general
Prime minister: Manasseh Sogavare 
Veteran politician Manasseh Sogavare returned to office in April 2019, and plunged the country into international controversy that September when he switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China.
He survived a no-confidence vote in December 2021, a week after protestors attempted to storm parliament and depose him over the move.
The Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation (SIBC) operates a public radio service. A high rate of illiteracy means that radio has a greater reach than the press.
Australia has donated equipment to SIBC and has sponsored programmes aimed at promoting peace. Press freedom is generally respected, says US-based Freedom House.

Pakistan: Aberystwyth uni buys students mopeds to stop abuse,"A university has donated four mopeds to students in Pakistan in a bid to stop sexual harassment putting women off education.
£2,000 was spent as part of the Aberystwyth University project, which is aimed at female students aged 18-25.
Each can borrow a moped throughout their course and get trained to use it.
It comes as many Pakistani women quit their studies due to sexual harassment on public transport while getting to and from their college or university.
Dr Shala Tabassum, head of gender studies at Fatima Jinnah Women University in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, said: ""Public transport in Pakistan is predominantly made for and used by men.
""Young women are often harassed and humiliated when they take the bus or train, and many decide not to continue with their education so they can avoid commuting problems like this.
""This project aims to dispel stereotypes and remove some of the cultural restrictions placed on young women's mobility."" 
One student, Noor-ul-Hada, said she was ""incredibly grateful for the opportunity"", adding: ""Now I can travel independently, free from any hassle or inconvenience, and truly embrace the freedom it offers.""
Another, Iqra Waheed, added: ""As I ride into the future on my new scooty, I am determined to continue pushing boundaries, chasing dreams, and making a positive impact in my community."" 
The project is one of four community transport initiatives to each get £2,000 through the Transport and Health Integrated research Network.
The other recipients, all Wales-based, are Age Connects Morgannwg, Social Inclusion through community-led transport and Encouraging Active Travel In Newtown.
Aberystwyth University's Prof Charles Musselwhite, who co-leads the project, said: ""This seed funding should provide a stepping stone to further research, in order to deepen understanding of the transport issue in question and begin to create strategies or interventions to mitigate or reduce its negative impact.""

Kiribati country profile,"The 33 atolls that make up Kiribati - the former Gilbert Islands - occupy a vast area in the equatorial Pacific - nearly 4,000km from east to west and more than 2,000km from north to south.
Kiribati - pronounced Kiribass - won independence from the United Kingdom in 1979. Home to the South Pacific's largest marine reserve, many of the atolls are inhabited; most of them are very low-lying and at risk from rising sea levels as a result of global warming.
With the Fijian government's permission, Kiribati has bought land in Fiji for food security and as a possible refuge.
Kiribati's economy is weak and is largely dependent on exports of copra and coconuts. Fishing licences, foreign aid and remittances from workers abroad also contribute, as does a trust fund set up with revenues from phosphate mines on the island of Banaba, whose depletion in 1980 hit Kiribati hard.
President: Taneti Maamau
Taneti Maamau was elected as president in March 2016.
He succeeded Anote Tong who served three successive terms, the maximum allowed by the constitution.
Freedom of speech and of the media is generally respected. The government-run radio station and newspaper offer diverse views. 
Protestant and Catholic churches publish newsletters and periodicals; these are important sources of information. There is no domestic TV service.
Key dates in the history of Kiribati:
11th-14th Centuries - Samoans migrate to the islands, Fijians and Tongans follow.
1820 - Named the Gilbert Islands, after British naval captain Thomas Gilbert, who visited on several of them when sailing from Australia to China in 1788.
1892 - Britain declares a protectorate over the Gilbert Islands and the neighbouring Ellice Islands (now Tuvalu), turning them both into The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony in 1916.
1943 - Japanese invade during World War Two. The Tarawa Atoll sees some of the fiercest fighting in the Pacific when US marines invade to drive out the Japanese.
1945 - Environmental damage caused by phosphate mining forces many residents of Banaba island to leave and settle on Rabi Island in Fiji.
1950s and 1960s - Britain explodes its first hydrogen bomb over Christmas Island. Britain and the US use Kiribati to carry out several nuclear tests. 
1975 - The colony is divided into two separate territories, the Gilbert Islands and the Ellice Islands.
1979 - The Gilbert Islands become an independent republic within the Commonwealth under the name of Kiribati.

Vietnam's iconic 'kissing rocks' at risk of collapse,"Vietnam's iconic ""kissing rocks"" in the heart of Ha Long Bay are at risk of collapse, a report has warned.
Ha Long Bay in Quang Ninh province is dotted with hundreds of tiny islets, attracting 4 million tourists in 2019.
The twin rocks, which rise out of the bay and appear to touch - or ""kiss"" - are highly popular with visitors.
But experts warned in a July report that rising sea levels and fishing boats travelling too close are causing the rocks to erode.
Ho Tien Chung of Vietnam's Institute of Geosciences and Mineral Resources said illegal fishing and unregulated tourism were helping to speed up the erosion of the rocks. 
While the institute was carrying out research for the report, workers observed one tourist boat stopping within just 19 metres of the islet.
Experts observed deep fissures crossing the rocks, warning that they could collapse if action is not taken to preserve them.
""Tourists can see the rocks that are precarious at low tide,"" Ho Tien Chung said. 
""The water level then is low, exposing the supporting foot of the rocks which are gradually being eroded, causing a risk of collapse if no measures are taken to protect and reinforce them soon."" 
Islets in the bay have long been buffeted by coastal erosion and several other notable tourist attractions have been heavily damaged in recent years by buffeting seas. 
To counteract the effects, the report urged officials to introduce new regulations to the bay, including limiting the speed of boats passing through it to just 5-10kmh (3-6mph). 
Local fishermen should also be encouraged to avoid fishing around the rocks to reduce churn and cement could be inserted into cracks in the islet to shore up its foundations, the report added.

Alpine guide finds body missing on Austrian glacier since 2001,"The body of a man who is believed to have died more than 20 years ago has been found on a rapidly melting glacier in the Austrian province of Tyrol. 
Police say a mountain guide discovered the body last week 2,900m (9,500ft) up the Schlatenkees glacier in East Tyrol.
A rucksack was found close by containing a bank card and a driving licence. Police used a helicopter to help retrieve the body. 
Police think the man was from Austria and was 37 years old when he died.  
DNA tests are being carried out to establish his identity.  
Police spokesman Christian Viehweider told BBC News it would take several weeks before the results of those tests would be known.  
The man, who had ski touring equipment with him, is believed to have had an accident in 2001.  
The Schlatenkees is thought to be one of the country's fastest-melting glaciers. In its report for 2021/2022, the Austrian Alpine Club said it was the glacier with the biggest recorded loss of 89.5m. 
Last April the Austrian Alpine Club said the melting of glaciers in Austria was at a record high. It said that it had never recorded such a large shrinkage of glaciers since its history of measuring began in 1891.  
There have been several similar discoveries in rapidly shrinking Alpine glaciers this summer as the melting ice reveals long-held secrets.  
In June a climber found human remains and bones on the same glacier in Tyrol, in the Venediger group of mountains. The remains are believed to have been in the Schlatenkees for decades. DNA testing is under way.  
""It is rather unusual to have two such discoveries on a glacier within such a short time,"" Mr Viehweider said. 
He said that around 45 people, missing in the Austrian Alps since 1964, are still unaccounted for.  
In Switzerland, the body of a German climber - missing since 1986 - was found on a glacier close to the Matterhorn mountain last month. It was discovered by mountaineers crossing the Theodul glacier above Zermatt. 
They noticed a hiking boot and crampons emerging from the ice. 
DNA analysis showed the body to be that of a German climber, who disappeared 37 years ago. A huge search and rescue operation at the time failed to find any trace of him.  
Police did not name the climber but said he was aged 38 when he went missing during a hike. 
Switzerland and Austria have been experiencing very hot conditions this summer and there are fears for the future of the Alpine glaciers which are key to Europe's environment. 
The winter snow stored by the glaciers fills European rivers such as the Rhine and the Danube, providing water for crops, or for cooling nuclear power stations.

Fiji country profile,"Fiji has one of the most developed economies in the Pacific, relying heavily on its tourism and sugar industries. 
Since independence from Britain in 1970, rivalry between the indigenous Fijian and the ethnic Indian communities has been at the root of much of the political upheaval in the country. 
The archipelago consists of more than 330 islands and 540 islets scattered over about 3,000,000 sq km (about 1.1 million sq miles). Of the islands, about 100 are inhabited. 
President: Jioji Konousi Konrote
Jioji Konousi Konrote was elected as president in October 2015. He is the first non-indigenous president and the first to be elected by parliament. Previous presidents were selected by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC). 
He has had a long career in the military, government and diplomatic service.
Prime Minister: Sitiveni Rabuka
Sitiveni became prime minister in December 2022 following general elections in which opposition parties reached a deal to form a new coalition government, ending Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama's nearly 16-year rule.
Fiji's coalition government has broader regional significance. Both parties have signalled a desire to cool relations with China, which has been steadily increasing its financial and diplomatic interests in the Pacific.
Mr Bainimarama came to power in a 2006 coup, one of a series of political upheavals since Fiji gained independence from the UK in 1970. The rivalry between the indigenous Fijian and the ethnic Indian communities has been at the root of much of the tensions.
In 2013 the constitution was changed to remove a race-based electoral system that favoured indigenous Fijians over the country's large Indian population.
Mr Rabuka is a former international rugby player who was the leader of Fiji's first coup in 1987, which came after tensions between indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians. He served as prime minister in 1992-99.
Private TV and radio stations operate alongside outlets run by the state-owned Fiji Broadcasting Corporation. 
Reporters Without Borders has praised the media's ""spirit of resistance"" but says journalists are restricted by a ""draconian"" media decree.
Some key dates in Fiji's history:
1643 - Dutch explorer Abel Tasman is the first European to visit the islands.
1830s - Western Christian missionaries begin to arrive.
1874 - Fiji becomes a British crown colony at the request of Fijian chiefs.
1875-76 - Measles epidemic wipes out one-third of the Fijian population; British forces and Fijian chiefs suppress rebellion. 
1879-1916 - More than 60,000 indentured labourers brought in from the Indian subcontinent to work on sugar plantations.
1916 - British colonial government in India stops the recruitment of indentured labourers.
1920 - All labour indenture agreements in Fiji end.
1970 - Fiji becomes independent with Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara of the AP as prime minister.
1987 - Indian-dominated coalition wins general election, ending 17 years of rule by the AP.  Lieutenant-Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka seizes power in a bloodless coup with the aim of making indigenous Fijians politically dominant. In a saecond coup he proclaims Fiji a republic
1999 - Mahendra Chaudhry is elected Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister but is overthown a year later when bankrupt businessman George Speight and retired major Ilisoni Ligairi storm parliament, aiming to make indigenous Fijians the dominant political force.
2001 - Elections to restore democracy.
2002 - Fiji announces radical privatisation plan designed to stave off collapse of vital sugar industry threatened by withdrawal of EU subsidies.
2006 - Military chief Frank Bainimarama carries out coup.
2012 - Martial law is lifted.
2014 - Frank Bainimarama becomes the country's civilian leader after winning parliamentary elections.
2016 - At least 42 people are killed and tens of thousands are left homeless as Cyclone Winston hits Fiji in the worst storm ever recorded in the southern hemisphere.

"Maui fires: More than 1,000 still missing as search continues","This video can not be played
Watch: 'We're not recovering whole bodies' but crumbling ash, Maui police chief says.
More than 1,000 people still remain unaccounted for after a wildfire ripped through Hawaiian town of Lahaina two weeks ago, officials said.
Authorities are now expected to make public a list of the missing in the coming days to try to narrow the search.
Some search teams combing through the rubble are finding only bones or fragments of bodies, which makes the task difficult.
The official death toll stands at 115.
The blazes destroyed most of the historic Maui town of Lahaina on 8 August and the fires are now considered the worst natural disaster in Hawaii state history. 
At a press conference on Tuesday, FBI special agent Steven Merrill overseeing the search said: ""We may not know in the end about everybody."" 
""We're considering everybody on that list until we can prove that they're not on that list."" 
Roughly 1,400 of the 2,500 people who were initially reported unaccounted for have been found.  But the exact number of the missing has been a difficult figure for officials to tally.
""Every day the numbers will change,"" Mr Merrill said. The latest missing estimate comes a day after Maui mayor Richard Bissen said the number was thought to be around 850. 
Officials have been unable to estimate how many of the 1000-plus missing are presumed dead.
Search crews with cadaver dogs have been scouring the burn area for human remains.  The ferocious heat from the fire, high enough to melt fire trucks, has made the task complicated as some of the search teams are finding only bones or fragments of bodies among piles of ash. 
Authorities have been asking family members to provide DNA to help identify victims. 
At least 104 DNA reference samples have been collected so far in an effort to ""construct family trees, or pedigrees"", Julie French of  DNA analysis company ANDE, told reporters.
The Lahaina fire burned roughly 3.39 sq miles (5.45 sq km) and destroyed at least 2,200 structures, according to the BBC's partner CBS. The damage is estimated to have cost $6bn (£4.7bn).
Officials have publicly identified 13 people who died in the blaze. Among them are an avid musician, loving grandmothers and an inspiring father.

Fiji media guide,"Privately-owned TV and radio stations operate alongside outlets run by the state-owned Fiji Broadcasting Corporation.
Freedom House says that the repressive climate that followed the 2006 coup has eased since democratic elections were held. 
Fiji has an active media sector, with several private television stations, radio stations, and newspapers. Opposition parties have accused the state of using its power to silence critics. 
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has praised the media's ""liveliness and spirit of resistance"". But is says journalists are restricted by a ""draconian"" media industry decree which became law in 2018. Reporters who violate its ""vaguely-worded"" rules risk imprisonment, and the risk of fines and jail time encourages self-censorship.
Radio is a key source of information, particularly on the outer islands. There are public and privately-owned stations. The BBC (88.2 FM), Radio Australia and Radio France Internationale are available via local relays.
There were 688,000 internet users by July 2022, comprising 76% of the population (Internetworldstats.com).

Cook Islands country profile,"The 15 volcanic islands and coral atolls of the Cook Islands are scattered over 1.9 sq km of the southern Pacific Ocean, between Tonga to the west and French Polynesia to the east.
Its economy centres on tourism; the territory's natural assets include fine beaches and volcanic mountains.
The Cook Islands is a self-governing island country in free association with New Zealand. Wellington provides it with aid and assistance and islanders have New Zealand citizenship.  
Since 2001 it has taken charge of its own foreign and defence policy, though it relies on New Zealand for its defence.
More than twice as many Cook Islanders live in New Zealand than live in the islands themselves. 
Named after Captain Cook, who explored them in 1773, the islands were once autonomous, home to tribes of mixed Polynesian ancestry.
Governments still seek advice on matters of culture, custom and land ownership from a council of hereditary leaders known as the House of Ariki.
Head of state: King Charles III, represented by a King's representative
Prime Minister: Mark Brown 
Mark Brown was re-elected Prime Minister in the August 2022 general elections. He had become prime minister on the retirement of Henry Puna in October 2020, having served as finance minister since 2010.
The main radio and TV stations are operated by the privately-owned Pitt Media Group, which also publishes weekly newspapers.
Radio Australia broadcasts on FM on Rarotonga.
Some key dates in the history of the Cook Islands:
1596 - Spaniard Alvaro de Mendana is the first European to sight the islands.
1773 - Captain James Cook explores the islands and names them the Hervey Islands. Fifty years later they are renamed after him.
1821 - English and Tahitian missionaries arrive, become the first non-native settlers.
1888 - Cook Islands are proclaimed a British protectorate and a single federal parliament is established.
1901 - Islands are annexed to New Zealand.
1946 - Legislative Council is established. For the first time since 1912, the territory has direct representation.
1965 - Islands become a self-governing territory in free association with New Zealand. 
1985 - Agreement on creating a South Pacific nuclear-free zone - the Rarotonga Treaty - is opened for signing on the main island.
1994 - A proposal for the Cook Islands to change its name is rejected in a referendum.
2017 - The Cook Islands creates the world's largest marine reserve - covering one million sq km of the Pacific Ocean.
2019-2020 - There are renewed calls for the Cook Islands to change its existing colonial-era name to an indigenous Māori name.
2022 - The US recognizes the Cook Islands and Niue as sovereign states, in line with a new Pacific plan that will pump $1.4bn into the region.

Chandrayaan-3: The race to unravel the mysteries of Moon's south pole,"The sun lingers slightly above or just below the horizon, while towering mountains project dark shadows. 
Deep craters provide a haven for unending darkness. Some of these areas have been shielded from sunlight for billions of years. In these regions, temperatures plummet to astonishing lows of -414F (-248C) - because the Moon has no atmosphere to warm up the surface. No human has set foot in this completely unexplored world. 
The Moon's south pole, according to Nasa, is full of ""mystery, science and intrigue"".
No wonder then that there's a so-called space race to reach the south pole of the Moon, far away from the Apollo landing sites clustered around the equator. 
On Wednesday, India landed a robotic probe - Chandrayaan-3 - near the south pole. Three days earlier, Russia's Luna-25 crashed into the Moon while attempting the same feat. 
India is also planning a joint Lunar Polar Exploration (Lupex) mission with Japan to explore the shadowed regions or the ""dark side of the Moon"" by 2026. 
Why is the south pole emerging as a compelling scientific destination? Scientists say a key reason is water. 
Data gathered by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a Nasa spacecraft that has been orbiting the Moon for 14 years, suggests water ice is present in some of the large, permanently shadowed craters that could potentially sustain humanity. 
Water exists as a solid or vapour on the Moon because of the vacuum - the Moon doesn't have enough gravity to hold an atmosphere. India's Chandrayaan-1 lunar mission was the first to find evidence of water on the Moon in 2008.
""It is yet to be proven that the water ice is accessible or mineable. In other words, are there reserves of water that can be extracted economically?"" Clive Neal, a professor of planetary geology at the US University of Notre Dame, told me.
The prospect of finding water on the Moon is exciting in many ways, scientists say. 
The frozen water untainted by the Sun's radiation might have accumulated in cold polar regions over millions of years, leading to the accumulation of ice on or near the surface. This provides a unique sample for scientists to analyse and understand the history of water in our solar system. 
""We can address questions such as where did the water come from and when, and what are the implications for the evolution on life on Earth,"" says Simeon Barber, a planetary scientist at UK's The Open University, who also works with the European Space Agency.
There are other ""pragmatic"" reasons for accessing water on or just below the Moon's surface, says Prof Barber. 
Many countries are planning new human missions to the Moon, and the astronauts will need water for drinking and sanitation. 
Transporting equipment from Earth to the Moon involves overcoming the Earth's gravitational pull. The larger the equipment, the more rocket and fuel load would be needed to achieve a successful landing on the Moon. The new commercial space companies charge around $1m to take a kilogram of payload to the Moon. 
""That's $1m per litre of drinking water! Space entrepreneurs no doubt see lunar ice as an opportunity to supply astronauts with locally sourced water,"" says Prof Barber.
That's not all. Water molecules can be broken apart into hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and both can be used as propellants to fire rockets. But first scientists need to know how much ice is there on the Moon, in what forms, and whether it can be extracted efficiently and purified to make it safe to drink. 
Also, some extremes at the south pole are bathed in sunlight for extended periods of time, up to 200 Earth days of constant illumination. ""Solar power is another resource [to set up a lunar base and power equipment] potential that the pole has,"" says Noah Petro, a project scientist at Nasa.
The lunar south pole also sits on the rim of a massive impact crater of the solar system. Spanning a diameter of 2,500km (1,600 miles) and reaching depths of up to 8km, this crater is one of the most ancient features within the solar system. ""By landing on the pole you can begin to understand what is going on with this large crater,"" says Dr Petro. 
Navigating the lunar pole with rovers, space suits and sampling tools in a distinctly different light and thermal environment in contrast to previously explored equatorial sites also promises to yield valuable insights.
But scientists are chary of calling this a race to the south pole. 
""These missions have been planned for decades and got delayed so many times. Race is not critical to our understanding of the Moon. The last time there was a real space race, we ended up losing interest in the Moon after three years and haven't returned to its surface in 50 years,"" says Vishnu Reddy, a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona.
The Indian and Russian missions also had some common objectives, scientists point out.  
Both aimed to land with similarly sized spacecraft in the south polar region, further south of the equator than any previous lunar mission.
Following an unsuccessful landing attempt in 2019, India wanted to showcase its capability for precise lunar touchdown near the pole. It also aims to examine the Moon's exosphere - an extremely sparse atmosphere - and analysing the polar regolith, an accumulation of loose particles and dust amassed over billions of years that rest above a bedrock. 
Luna-25's objectives included the analysis of the polar regolith's composition, as well as an examination of plasma and dust elements of the lunar pole exosphere. 
To be sure, the landing site of the Indian orbiter is a ""bit away from the actual pole"". ""But the data [it provides] will be fascinating,"" says Prof Neal.
Russia and China have plans to build a lunar space station to develop research facilities on the surface of the Moon, in orbit or both. Russia is planning more Luna missions. Nasa is sending instruments on commercial landers to go to places across the Moon. Japan is preparing to send a smart lander (the SLIM mission) on 26 August - a small-scale mission to demonstrate accurate lunar landing techniques by a small explorer. 
And, of course, Nasa's Artemis programme aims to put astronauts back on the Moon in a series of spaceflights, more than half a century after the last Apollo mission.  
""The Moon is like a giant puzzle. We have some of the pieces, the corners and edges based on samples and lunar meteorite data. We have a picture of what the Moon is like, but it is incomplete,"" says Dr Petro.
""The Moon is still surprising us.""

Tokelau profile,"Three far-flung coral atolls - Atafu, Nukunonu and Fakaofo - make up Tokelau, a dependant territory of New Zealand in the southern Pacific Ocean.
Lying between New Zealand and Hawaii, Tokelau has few physical links with the wider world. There is no airport and it takes more than a day at sea to reach its southern neighbour, Samoa.
Most of the 1,500 islanders live by subsistence farming. Thousands have chosen to leave, usually for New Zealand or Samoa. The latter has a similar culture and language. 
Earmarked by the UN as a territory where it wants to encourage greater independence, Tokelauans have twice voted to retain their colonial status. 
Tokelau's main industry is fishing but it also generates income from the use of its internet domain name as one of the countries offering free registration. 
New Zealand is the territory's main budget provider and has sought to allay fears that it will abandon the atolls should Tokelau favour autonomy. 
Like other low-lying Pacific territories, Tokelau is said to be at risk from rising sea levels. It is also vulnerable to tropical cyclones. 
Head of state: King Charles III
Head of government
Political leadership revolves around three Faipule, or village heads, who take it in turns to oversee a cabinet - the Council for Ongoing Government - for a year.
The General Fono, an assembly of elected delegates, handles local legislative affairs. It is also responsible for the territory's budget. 
Each atoll has a Taupulega, or Council of Elders. 
Tokelau is a non-self-governing territory and is administered by New Zealand. The Administrator of Tokelau is appointed by the New Zealand government and is responsible for supervising the government of the territory.
Each atoll operates an FM community radio station, carrying shipping news, weather reports and music. 
The stations are: Radio Atafu FM; Radio Fakaofo FM; and Radio Nukunonu FM. 
The outlets are overseen by the Council for Ongoing Government. 
Key dates in the history of Tokelau:
c. 1000AD - Archaeological evidence indicates the atolls of Tokelau - Atafu, Nukunonu and Fakaofo - were settled from Samoa and may have been a key point in migration towards eastern Polynesia.
1765 - Royal Navy Commodore John Byron is the first European to sight Atafu, which he names ""Duke of York's Island"". 
1791 - Royal Navy Captain Edward Edward visits Atafu in search of mutineers from HMS Bounty.
early-19th Century - Islands are periodically visited by European or US ships.
1845-1870s - Protestant and Catholic missionaries visit the islands.
1862-63 - Peruvian ""blackbirder"" slave traders kidnap many of the men on the islands to work as labourers. Most die of dysentery and smallpox, and few return.
1877 - Tokelau becomes a British protectorate in 1877, a status that is formalised in 1889. 
1916 - Britain annexes the islands and includes them within the boundaries of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, now Kiribati and Tuvalu.
1926 - Britain passes administration of Tokelau to New Zealand.
1948 - Formal sovereignty is transferred to New Zealand with the enactment of the Tokelau Act 1948. Tokelau becomes part of New Zealand on 1 January 1949.
1980 - Treaty of Tokehega between New Zealand and the US settles disputed claims and delineates the maritime boundary between Tokelau and American Samoa.
2006 and 2007 - Two referendums are held proposing turning Tokelau from a non-self-governing territory into a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand. Both fail to get the two-thirds majority required to pass.
2011 - Tokelau declares its entire exclusive economic zone of 319,031 sq km a shark sanctuary.

Chandrayaan-3: India makes historic landing near Moon's south pole,"This video can not be played
Watch a live simulation of the moment India’s Chandrayaan-3 lands on the Moon
India has made history as its Moon mission becomes the first to land in the lunar south pole region.
With this, India joins an elite club of countries to achieve a soft landing on the Moon, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.
The Vikram lander from Chandrayaan-3 successfully touched down as planned at 18:04 local time (12:34 GMT).
Celebrations have broken out across the country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying ""India is now on the Moon"".
""We have reached where no other country could. It's a joyous occasion,"" he added. Mr Modi was watching the event live from South Africa where he is attending the Brics summit.
Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath said the successful landing ""is not our work alone, this is the work of a generation of Isro scientists"".
India's achievement comes just days after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft spun out of control and crashed into the Moon.
The crash also put the spotlight on how difficult it is to land in the south pole region where the surface is ""very uneven"" and ""full of craters and boulders"". 
India's second lunar mission, which also attempted to soft-land there in 2019, was unsuccessful - its lander and rover were destroyed, though its orbiter survived.
On Wednesday, tense moments preceded the touchdown as the lander - called Vikram after Isro founder Vikram Sarabhai - began its precarious descent, carrying within its belly the 26kg rover named Pragyaan (the Sanskrit word for wisdom). 
The lander's speed was gradually reduced from 1.68km per second to almost zero, enabling it to make a soft landing on the lunar surface. 
In a few hours - scientists say once the dust has settled - the six-wheeled rover will crawl out of the lander's belly and roam around the rocks and craters on the Moon's surface, gathering crucial data and images to be sent to Earth.
One of the mission's major goals is to hunt for water-based ice which, scientists say, could support human habitation on the Moon in future. It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations. Scientists say the surface area that remains in permanent shadow there is huge and could hold reserves of water ice.
The lander and the rover are carrying five scientific instruments which will help discover the physical characteristics of the surface of the Moon, the atmosphere close to the surface and the tectonic activity to study what goes on below the surface.
The rover is carrying an Indian flag and its wheels also have Isro's logo and emblem embossed on them so that they leave imprints on the lunar soil during the Moon walk, an official told the BBC.
Chandrayaan-3, India's third lunar mission, will work to build on the success of the earlier Moon missions and Isro officials say it will help make some ""very substantial"" scientific discovery.
It comes 15 years after Chandrayaan-1, the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime.
And despite failing the soft landing, Chandrayaan-2 was not a complete write-off - its orbiter continues to circle the Moon even today and will help the Vikram lander send images and data to Earth for analysis.
India is not the only country with an eye on the Moon - there's a growing global interest in it, with many other missions headed to the lunar surface in the near future. And scientists say there is still much to understand about the Moon that's often described as a gateway to deep space.

I'm at a bar in the Wisconsin city of Milwaukee, known for its cheese curds and beer, ahead of a key date in the election calendar. On Wednesday, it is set to host the first debate between Republicans hoping to be the party's nominee in 2024.
I'm here because I want to better understand how social media is shaping next year's election, so I'm meeting a group of voters with a range of different political views and experiences. Many of them rely on social media to keep up to date with the election.  
For the past year, I've been running an experiment for the Americast podcast to see what different US voters are recommended and exposed to on social media. 
But now I want to understand more about how this kind of content could be impacting real voters' opinions on Donald Trump, Joe Biden and the election process. 
Memes of former president Donald Trump are inescapable, my panel of voters all agree.
Sometimes he is dressed like a superhero or there are computer generated pictures of him in orange jail scrubs following his indictments. 
These images are funny, says Andrew who doesn't feel represented by mainstream political figures any more and uses social media as his main source of news.
Well it's funny to a degree, he adds. There are times when he realises that politics is actually serious, these people are in charge and he's losing trust in them.
The memes seem to have solidified in his mind the image of Trump as someone who's a winner. But, like several of the other voters on my panel, the over-saturation of Trump-related content is turning him off the former president. 
""Everybody cares about [Donald] Trump and [President] Biden. They don't care about anything else in this country. It's like 'which one of these two is more screwed up?'"" 
Ken agrees. He's a professor of justice and public policy at Concordia University Wisconsin, as well as a retired Milwaukee police lieutenant. He's tired of the constant battle on social media and the way memes on all sides pit candidates against each other. 
""I think Trump is both [a hero and a villain]. I think he's done some good things and some bad things.""
""I'm seeing the same vitriol on both sides and for the first time in my life, I'm tired of politics"". 
Posts about the current president, who is running again, also come up a lot.
Videos frequently comment on President Joe Biden's age and show examples of where he's lost his footing or slurred his words. 
He's branded as Sleepy Joe, a nickname Trump has given him. That image has really cut through with all of the panel. They all say they've seen this kind of content and their main criticism of Biden is his age. 
The memes are a little exaggerated but there's some truth to them, says Mary, who is originally from Wisconsin but now lives in Florida in retirement. 
""I mean, Joe Biden is old and sleepy. He hasn't done a lot of positive things for the country. He needs to move on. And Donald Trump did some great things for the country when he was president. But Donald Trump has probably had his time as well.""
Other posts describe Biden as ""Dark Brandon"", depicting him with bright red eyes and like an evil mastermind. 
But there are positive images as well, presenting him as competent and on top of the economy, often with bar charts and animations. 
Amanda, who was born and raised in Milwaukee, is more aligned to the Democrats and tends to see good things about Biden on her feed. 
""I think he is old and slow. But I think he's doing the best he can, given his age."" 
Meet the BBC’s 'undercover voters'
Mr Trump has been charged by prosecutors in Washington and in Georgia with trying to subvert the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to Joe Biden.
Most of the panel in Milwaukee condemned posts they had seen that falsely suggested the election was stolen from Mr Trump. They described him as a ""sore loser"". 
But Andrew is not so sure. The content he's seen online suggesting the election is rigged appears to have undermined his faith in democracy. 
 ""There's a lot of distrust in government,"" he says. ""Maybe Trump is a sore loser. Maybe we [Republicans] lost.  Maybe they cheated and maybe he didn't. How am I suppose to tell?"" 
Despite being unsure if the election was rigged he still plans to vote in the next one but fears his vote may just ""go in the trash"". 
But Ken, the retired police officer, pushes back. 
""I think there needs to be more transparency, right? I've worked polls, I've been a chief poll inspector for Milwaukee during an election."" 
If people like Andrew understood more about how the process worked, says Ken, maybe they would be able to trust the process.
They all appreciate having a positive conversation in person free from the polarisation they encounter online.
""I don't think people are nearly as divided as they make it seem like,"" says Andrew. ""I feel like at the end of the day, the five of us would all kind of agree on something similar.""
Amanda says she finds it really hard to even post about politics anymore. 
""Sometimes I'll post one thing and then all of a sudden I get a lot of hate and I'm like, Okay, I wasn't trying to have an argument.""
That division, in Ken's mind, can be blamed on social media and its algorithms, which reinforce opinions on both sides.
""I wish we spent more time getting to know people different from us here in Wisconsin than bothering with who the next president is going to be.""

First Republican debate: How to watch and what time does it start,"The Republican race is on to pick the party's next presidential candidate and televised debates will be staged to winnow a crowded field of hopefuls. The first such forum takes place on Wednesday night - minus the contest's current frontrunner, Donald Trump. 
But the former president will try to steal the limelight by releasing his interview with Tucker Carlson at the same time.
Eight candidates have qualified for the Fox News showdown after meeting criteria set by the Republican National Committee. 
The debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, begins at 21:00 EDT (01:00 GMT). 
Here's what we know about the event and the contenders that made the cut. 
To participate in the event, candidates had to meet a number of thresholds set by the Republican National Committee, including chalking up 40,000 individual campaign donations. 
The candidates were also required to have at least 1% support in three separate national polls, or two national polls and one from an early presidential primary state such as Iowa. They also had to sign a pledge to support the Republican party's eventual presidential candidate. Mr Trump has refused to sign the pledge. 
Eight candidates as well as the former president qualified, the Republican National Committee said on Monday night:
The debate will be broadcast on all of Fox's platforms, including Fox News Digital, Fox News Audio and the Fox Business Network, as well as the media giant's streaming service, Fox Nation.
It will last approximately two hours, ending at 23:00 EDT (03:00 GMT). 
Why won't Trump show up? 
Mr Trump - whom opinion polls consistently place well ahead of his Republican rivals - has confirmed he will not participate in the debate. 
""The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,"" Mr Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.  ""I will therefore not be doing the debates.""
The former president added that recent polling demonstrates that he has ""legendary"" levels of support among Republican voters. 
Instead of going to Milwaukee, Mr Trump has recorded a pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. On Wednesday morning, he revealed that interview would air on X, formerly known as Twitter, at the same time as the debate. 
This could draw viewers away from Fox, which Mr Trump has called a ""hostile network"", saying it has not treated him fairly. 
A poll released by CBS and YouGov last week shows that Mr Trump's already commanding lead over the other candidates has grown, even as he faced a fourth criminal indictment.
Some 62% of likely Republican primary voters say he is their preferred candidate. 
But that does not mean the debate does not matter. The same CBS poll showed that a vast majority of likely voters - 91% - want the candidates to focus on making the case for themselves, rather than making the debate about Mr Trump. 
Among the voters at least considering another candidate in addition to Mr Trump, about 50% said they are ""waiting to see the debate"". This could mean a potential boost for any participating candidates who are able to strike a chord with viewers. 
Historically, it has often been the case that strong performances help candidates.
In the 2016 Republican election cycle for example, support for Mr Trump rose from about 24% on the day of the first debate to just over 30% by the time of the second one.
Another candidate, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, saw an even bigger opinion poll bump, jumping from 5.8% on the day of the first debate to about 20% at its sequel. 
Whether or not any boost is enough to overcome Mr Trump's lead, however, remains to be seen. 
The second Republican debate of the 2024 election cycle is due to take place on Wednesday, 27 September at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute in Simi Valley, California. 
Further details about the second debate will be released in the ""coming weeks"", according to Fox.

Israeli Arabs demand action over spike in murders linked to organised crime,"Israeli Arab groups are calling for an emergency session of the country's parliament, after the latest series of murders within the community. 
Four men were shot dead in the Arab town of Abu Snan, in the northern Galilee region, on Tuesday.
Three were members of the same family, including a candidate for the local mayoral election. 
Opposition politicians have blamed the government for failing to crackdown on organised crime gangs.
The bodies of the four men were found in a field after what paramedics said was a significant amount of gunfire. 
One of victims was Ghazi Saab, a 53-year-old who had been due to announce his candidacy for Abu Snan's mayor later that day. 
The others were identified as his nephews, Zaher al-Din Saab, 45, and Amir Saab, 28, as well as 66-year-old Salman Khalab from the nearby town of Yarka.
A cousin of Ghazi Saab told the Haaretz newspaper that he had been a senior Israeli Border Police officer and businessman, and that ""the whole family is respectable"". ""He was one of five candidates for council head, but I don't think it's related,"" they added.
A police spokesperson also said there was no evidence so far connecting Mr Saab's candidacy to the murder.
Haaretz reported that hours after the shootings an 18-year-old Palestinian man was stabbed to death near the southern Bedouin town of Lakiya. 
Police said they suspected a criminal motive behind the killing of Majid Faisal Dais, who was from the occupied West Bank.
On Monday night, the director general of the central town of Tira, Abdul Rahman Kashua, was shot dead next to the municipal headquarters and a police station. 
The killings are believed to be connected to organised crime gangs within the Israeli Arab community, as a spiralling murder rate sends shockwaves through its population of around two million. 
Almost 160 people have been murdered this year alone. That is already 40% more than the total reported in 2022 by the Abraham Initiatives, a group that promotes Israeli Arab and Jewish equality.
One political party - the Arab Movement for Renewal (Taal) - is demanding urgent action by the Israeli authorities, with many blaming a failure of representation and proper policing by the state.
The politics around solving the issue are becoming increasingly febrile.
A leading opposition MP blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for putting the police in the hands of Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right firebrand national security minister who has a history of anti-Arab racism. 
""The Arab society is in crisis, and the prime minister is busy making empty promises,"" former Defence Minister Benny Gantz said. 
Mr Netanyahu's office said the prime minister was convening his government taskforce to deal with it. 
On Tuesday, he said the murder of Abdul Rahman Kashua had ""crossed a red line"" and vowed to use all means, including the Shin Bet security service, ""in order to defeat this crime"". 
""We have eliminated organised crime in the Jewish sector in Israel and we will eliminate organized crime in the Arab sector in Israel,"" he added. 
Mr Ben-Gvir released a lengthy statement on Wednesday that blamed the violence on ""militias"" within the Arab community, who he said would ultimately ""turn their fire against the State of Israel"". 
He repeated his call for detention without trial for suspects and for the Shin Bet to detect organised crime. That has been taken to mean surveillance of Arab citizens suspected of crimes - a highly controversial suggestion which has reportedly been previously rejected. 
Israeli Arabs - many of whom prefer to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel - make up a fifth of the country's population.
In theory, they have equal rights with Jewish citizens, but they routinely complain of state discrimination.

"UK-India trade talks enter 'final, trickier' stage - government sources","UK trade talks with India are reaching their ""final but trickier"" stages, according to government sources.
Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch is visiting India for a meeting of G20 trade ministers this week.
There has been speculation about whether a trade deal may be struck before Rishi Sunak visits India in September.
But the BBC has been told there is currently no expectation in government a full deal will be agreed by then.
Government sources said they hoped a deal could now be ""months"" away, but they stressed there were still some ""big nuts to crack"".
A trade deal with India has long been seen in government as one of the biggest prizes of all deals the UK could strike with other nations following Brexit.
Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised in April last year to get an agreement ""done"" by Diwali in the autumn of 2022 - but that deadline was missed.
The UK has been particularly keen to strike an agreement that could bring down tariffs on UK exports including cars and whisky, which currently face triple-figure tariffs, or import taxes, in India.
Those tariffs mean UK products can have a much higher price tag in India, making them less competitive.
Trade talks have faced some hurdles in the last year, in particular due to British ministers' refusal so far to grant more visas to Indian workers.
Nick Thomas-Symonds, Labour's shadow international trade secretary, said: ""The Conservatives' record on trade negotiations has been to deliver bad deals or no deals at all. 
""They committed to delivering agreements with India and with the United States by the end of 2022, yet failed to meet their own deadline. So them trumpeting the latest round of trade talks falls far short the concrete action needed to get any deal across the line."" 
The UK has been keen to get India to allow more UK City firms and service industries to set up business in the country. 
William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said this would be the ""big win"" for British businesses - particularly UK travel, business or financial services.
""Up to 80% of the UK economy is services-based,"" he said. 
But he added: ""That's one of the last areas that India would want to make agreement at this point, because that's where it has leverage.
""Having much more visa access to the UK will be part of the key things to get a deal over the line.
""If there is a future stage later in the year where the two prime ministers meet face to face for a further push - it's really going to be that issue of services access in return for better access for Indian nationals in the UK.
""It is a bigger export market and it's one which is rapidly increasing its prosperity. Also India hasn't done many trade agreements, so the UK is relatively front of the queue here."" 
Ms Badenoch is travelling to India to meet fellow trade ministers in the G20 group of wealthy nations, rather than to hold formal negotiations on a UK-India deal.
However, talks between officials from both sides will be ongoing in India during the visit, and she is set to have a one-on-one meeting with her Indian counterpart after the G20 meeting is over.
She will also be talking to the so-called B20, the business equivalent of the G20, chaired by Indian conglomerate Tata, which recently announced more than £4bn of investment in a gigafactory in Somerset. 
The UK is hoping to proactively encourage other Indian investors to invest in the UK. 
There have been some media reports, particularly in India, suggesting that a deal is ""close"" and could be reached to coincide with Rishi Sunak's visit for the G20 leaders' summit in September. 
But officials have indicated that it is unlikely a full deal will be agreed by then.
Government sources stressed that, while the last round of talks ""closed some chapters"", negotiations get ""harder, not easier"".
UK officials are preparing for there to be a need for further talks following the trade secretary's visit this week.
Mr Sunak is expected to receive a warm welcome when he visits in September. His appointment as the first British Indian prime minister was one of the top stories across Indian media.
Indian broadcaster NDTV ran a headline at the time saying: ""Indian son rises over the empire. Rishi Sunak first Indian origin UK PM. History comes full circle in Britain."" 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described him as the ""living bridge"" of UK Indians, while the Times of India suggested the appointment of a Hindu PM had brought India Diwali cheer. 
A department for business and trade spokesperson said: ""The UK and India are committed to working towards the best deal possible for both sides.
""We've made good progress in closing chapters, and are now laser-focused on goods, services and investment. 
""While we cannot comment on ongoing negotiations, we are clear that we will only sign when we have a deal that is fair, balanced, and ultimately in the best interests of the British people and the economy.""

Gamescom: The biggest announcements at the show,"Space, alternative reality and a stage invasion organisers would probably rather forget were among the highlights from this year's Gamescom.
The opening night of Europe's biggest gaming show is usually an important one for fans hoping to catch a glimpse of their favourite series.
Thousands attended in-person in Germany and many more tuned in online.
Here is a rundown of the memorable moments from the night, including a gaming first.
We're now just days away from the launch of this huge space adventure, which promises an open world spanning multiple planets.
It's made by Bethesda, the studio that developed Fallout 3 and fantasy epic Elder Scrolls. 
We found out from the game's executive producer Todd Howard how the story begins.
The player joins a group called The Constellation, which he described as ""NASA meets Indiana Jones"". 
There was then a look at a live action trailer, teasing some of the exploration players can expect, but no actual footage from the game.
A new Call of Duty (CoD) game is not the biggest surprise these days, and this year it's the turn of Modern Warfare 3.
We already knew it had a new story mode and multiplayer, as well as the series' popular Zombies survival mode, which had previously only popped up in Black Ops entries.
Now we've had a glimpse at what's next for the series' main characters, with an extended look at the gameplay from the first level, named Operation 627.
There was also something for die-hard followers of the series, with the news players will head back to Verdansk - the setting of the original CoD Warzone game.
Fans of the survival horror game Alan Wake have had to wait 13 years for a sequel, but it's now just weeks away. 
A new trailer has likely built up the hype even more, including details on a spooky new dream reality.
That's going to use a mixture of live action footage with actors, blended with computer generated graphics. 
The aim? Make the game as uncanny and creepy as possible. 
Gamers will be able to decide if they've pulled it off when they get their hands on it.
Assassin's Creed is known for taking us to some of the most exciting locations in history. 
This time it's got fans talking for a different reason.
For the first time at a major game launch at an international conference, a trailer had a full Arabic language voiceover with English instead included as subtitles. 
And Assassin's Creed Mirage will also have full Arabic language voice acting when main character Basim, who gamers will have previously met in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, explores the historic cityscape.
The slick presentation of the opening night conference didn't go without a hitch. 
One stage invader decided to crash the party, seemingly to protest a lack of details on the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6. 
The show's host Geoff Keighley was interrupted by a man saying ""Bill Clinton wants to play GTA 6"". 
That seemed to be in reference to the YouTuber Matan Even, also known as the Bill Clinton Kid, who crashed the same show last year.
As he was led away, loud boos could be heard from the crowd.
""That's just so disappointing,"" host Geoff Keighley said.

Russian general who ran Ukraine war fired - report,"One of Russia's leading military figures, Gen Sergei Surovikin, has reportedly lost his job as air force chief after weeks of speculation about his disappearance from public view.
Ria Novosti agency said he had been relieved of his post, citing a source. 
For several months Gen Surovikin was in charge of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine but he has not been seen since the Wagner mutiny in June.
Observers believe his removal dates back to the botched rebellion.
One Russian report quoted a defence ministry source as saying he had been dismissed because of a transfer to a new job and he was now on a short vacation.
His role as head of aerospace forces has been taken on by air force chief of staff, Gen Viktor Afzalov, Ria Novosti adds.
During the hours that Wagner mercenaries marched towards Moscow on 24 June, Gen Surovikin appeared in a video appealing to them to return to base. 
But his awkward performance was later compared to a hostage-style video. The general was known to have good relations with Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who reserved his loathing for other figures in the defence hierarchy.
In the weeks after the June revolt, there were unconfirmed reports by Russian military bloggers that Gen Surovikin had been detained for questioning. But officials denied he was being held in a pre-trial detention centre and one retired general said that he was merely ""resting"" and unavailable.
Gen Surovikin, a 56-year-old veteran of the Soviet campaign in Afghanistan in the 1980s, was given the nickname General Armageddon for his brutal tactics in Syria. 
As commander of Russian forces and later the air force he left much of the second city, Aleppo, in ruins and bombarded civilians in rebel-held Idlib province. He was the first army officer to head Russia's aerospace forces and had no experience in aviation.
His big promotion came in October 2022, when he was made commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, months into the flagging, full-scale invasion.
His three months in charge were not a success. On the day he was appointed, the bridge over the Kerch Strait was attacked, and weeks later he ordered a retreat from the city of Kherson. Within three months he was replaced by Russian chief of staff Valery Gerasimov, becoming one of his deputies.
Russia's military leaders have had little to boast about since President Vladimir Putin sent in the troops in February 2022 and many of the top brass have been moved to different posts.
Before Gen Surovikin was put in charge of the operation, the war effort was run by Col-Gen Gennady Zhidko. He died in Moscow last week after what officials said was a ""lengthy illness"".

What do we know about drone attacks in Russia?,"This video can not be played
Watch: Huge blast as drone explodes in Moscow
Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of carrying out drone strikes on its territory in recent months.
Two suspected drone attacks have struck near Moscow's main business district over the past week, hitting a skyscraper under construction on 23 August and the Expo Centre exhibition complex several days earlier.
Elsewhere, three people were killed by a suspected drone attack in the border region of Belgorod on 23 August and five people were injured when a railway station was hit in Kursk Region some days earlier, Russian officials say.
A suspected drone attack left one of Russia's flagship Tupolev Tu-22 bombers ablaze at an airbase south of St Petersburg, according to footage verified by the BBC.
Although Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility for specific drone strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"".
According to Russian media reports monitored by BBC Verify, there have been over 160 suspected aerial drone attacks this year in Russia and in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine.
There have also been about a dozen sea drone attacks on Russian targets in the Black Sea, including on naval bases and the Crimean bridge.
The aerial drone attacks have been concentrated in the Bryansk and Belgorod regions in Russia near the western border with Ukraine, as well as in Russian-annexed Crimea.
There have been a series of drone attacks in the Moscow region in recent months, which is about 450km (280 miles) from the border with Ukraine, including a wave of strikes on 30 May that damaged several buildings.
Flights were diverted from Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow after a drone attack on 4 July, and the airport briefly closed following drone attacks on 30 July and 1 August.
Russia accused Ukraine of trying to kill President Vladimir Putin in an alleged attack on his residence in the Kremlin on 3 May - an allegation Kyiv denies.
Oil facilities, airfields and energy infrastructure have all been targeted in 2023.
We have identified at least nine reported drone attacks on oil depots. One of these was in Sevastopol, a major city in Crimea, which was hit on 29 April, destroying several of its oil tanks.
On 31 May, an oil refinery was set ablaze in Krasnodar Territory in southern Russia, about 200km (124 miles) from the Crimean border. The regional governor said it was probably caused by a drone.
Layla Guest, an analyst at Sibylline security consultancy, says: ""Ukrainian forces will highly likely prioritise targeting oil refineries, as well as railway infrastructure and wider Russian logistics, to cause maximum disruption."" 
In February, a drone crashed about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, in what the local governor said was an attempt to target civilian infrastructure.
A picture of the wreckage appeared to be consistent with a UJ-22 - a type of drone manufactured by Ukraine.
It has a range of 800km (497 miles) in autonomous flight. Its range under directly-controlled flight is much shorter.
Another suspected drone attack injured at least 10 Russian soldiers at a military training ground in the Voronezh region on 10 May, according to local media reports. 
And in December last year, a drone attack hit an airbase 600km (372 miles) north-east of the Ukrainian border, leaving three people dead, according to the Russian military.
Social media reports that several recent attacks on Moscow have involved drones of the ""Beaver"" type - a long-range attack aircraft said to be recently manufactured by Ukraine.
Drone specialist Steve Wright, of the University of the West of England, cross-examined images of these aircraft against the verified footage of the 30 May strikes on Moscow.
He concluded the two examples are consistent in design and the Beaver was ""most likely"" used.
Drones have been deployed by both sides in the conflict, with Russia using Iranian-made drones on targets in Ukraine.
Ukraine says it is rapidly increasing its production of drones as demand grows on the front line.
In terms of range, experts say drones launched from Ukraine could reach deep into Russian territory, and as far as Moscow, which is about 450km (280 miles) from the border.
""Although Ukraine has not confirmed that its armed forces carried out the attacks [on Moscow], I think that the pre-emptive raids we have seen last year prove that Ukraine has the capability to launch long range attacks of that kind from within Ukrainian territory,"" says David Cenciotti, editor of the Aviationist blog. 
Drone specialist Steve Wright also said it was possible that a drone could hit the Kremlin having been launched from within Ukraine. 
But he added: ""My guess is that the drone was launched from far closer in than that, as this would avoid it having to run the gauntlet of much of Moscow's defences.""
Ukraine's Minister for Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov boasted of a Ukrainian drone called the R18 that ""can fly from Kyiv to Moscow and back"".
But he denied that he was calling for drone strikes on Moscow.
Mr Cenciotti says: ""Ukraine has made extensive use of several drones, with the Bayraktar TB2 drone emerging as the real star of the air war for Ukraine, inflicting heavy losses on Russian forces, some of those caught on tape and circulated online.""
Turkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, while the Turkish manufacturer of the drones has donated to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.

"Ukraine war: Three elderly people killed in Russian shelling, say officials","Three people have been killed in Russian artillery fire near the eastern Ukrainian city of Lyman, Ukrainian authorities say.
The three who reportedly died - two women and a man aged 63 to 88 - were sitting on a bench in the village of Torske when shelling hit.
The area is close to the front line and regularly comes under attack.
Meanwhile a drone attack on the Danube river port of Izmail destroyed 13,000 tons of grain.
Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said the grain had been destined for export to Egypt and Romania and the drone strike had reduced the port's export capacity by 15%.
""Russia is systematically hitting grain silos and warehouses to stop agricultural exports,"" he said.
Over the past month Russian strikes on its sea and river ports had destroyed 270,000 tons of grain, he said.
Elsewhere, there have been reports of explosions in the port city of Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea.
The peninsula's Russian-appointed proxy governor said the fleet was conducting firing exercises.
Meanwhile, four civilians were injured by mortar fire and a residential building was damaged by two drones in Seredyna-Buda, in the Sumy region of north-eastern Ukraine, the regional military administration said on Facebook.

"British Museum treasures safe, MP insists after thefts","Greek claims that the British Museum is not safe after a series of thefts are ""blatant opportunism"", the chair of its cross-party group has said.
MP Tim Loughton said it was ""incredibly rare"" for items to go missing and the institution was taking it ""seriously"".
Archaeologist Despoina Koutsoumba said the museum could no longer claim Greek heritage was being protected.
Greece has long campaigned for the return of the Parthenon sculptures also known as the Elgin Marbles.
The institution said a staff member had been sacked after treasures were reported ""missing, damaged or stolen"".
Legal action is being taken by the museum against the unnamed member of staff.
The Economic Crime Command of the Metropolitan Police is investigating but no arrests have been made. The museum has also started an independent review of security.
Items including gold, jewellery and semi-precious gemstones are among those missing, though the museum has not specified which items in particular.
It is now believed that more than 1,500 objects were stolen, damaged and destroyed, in a crisis that is threatening the institution's reputation. 
According to the PA news agency, the missing items are believed to have been taken over a ""significant"" period of time.
Mr Loughton, who chairs the British Museum All-Party Parliamentary Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that news of items going missing from the collection in London was ""damaging"", but so too were claims the museum was not safe. 
""What is particularly damaging is [the] blatant opportunism of the Greeks and others saying, 'Oh no, the British Museum is not safe',"" he said.
The Tory MP, who has been in touch with the museum, said it had undertaken a ""tremendous amount of work cataloguing"" items in its collection and had the most online documentation in the world.
""People want to know the extent of the objects which have disappeared, what investigations took place at the time when various reports came in and what is being done now because otherwise [it's] getting out of hand,"" he added.
His comments follow renewed calls by officials in Greece for the return of the Parthenon sculptures - among the most high-profile contested items in the museum's collection.
The sculptures, also known as the Elgin Marbles, once adorned the Parthenon atop the Acropolis in Athens and have been on display in the museum since the 19th Century.
Greece has long claimed they were illegally acquired during a period of foreign occupation. 
Ms Koutsoumba, director of the Association of Greek Archaeologists, told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight programme that it was ""obvious"" the sculptures would be well protected in Greece, not in the museum.
""We are very much worried how many Greek items were [among] these stolen items and we want to tell the British Museum that they cannot anymore say that Greek cultural heritage is more protected in the British Museum,"" she said. 
""They have to return the Parthenon marbles back because they are not safe in London."" 
She added that the potential security issues the thefts have exposed were a ""problem for all museums in the world"".
""All museums in the world have to learn what happened in the British Museum so that if we have problems in our security protocols [we can] change it,"" she said.
The BBC has also seen correspondence showing that an art dealer alerted the museum to the alleged stolen items in 2021. 
Ittai Gradel alleged in February 2021 he had seen items online belonging to the museum, according to the correspondence.
Deputy director Jonathan Williams responded in July 2021 to Mr Gradel, saying ""there was no suggestion of any wrongdoing"".
The museum's independent review is being led by former museum trustee Sir Nigel Boardman and Lucy D'Orsi, Chief Constable of British Transport Police.

Thaksin's return seals grand Thai political bargain,"When fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra made his dramatic return to Thailand there was one question everyone was asking: how long would he actually spend in jail?
Now we know the answer: just over 12 hours. 
To no-one's surprise Thailand's department of corrections said this morning that, in order to monitor a heart condition, Mr Thaksin was whisked to a civilian hospital at midnight. 
He is expected to stay there, in his own private wing or floor, while he prepares to petition King Vajiralongkorn for a pardon to set aside the eight-year prison sentence on three charges imposed in his absence. This was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Bangkok shortly after his arrival.
The end of Mr Thaksin's 15-year-long exile is not an isolated event. It is a part of a grand political bargain. It is being put in place, like the pieces of a jigsaw, to end the epic contest for power between the telecoms tycoon and his populist Pheu Thai party, and Thai conservative groups aligned with the military and monarchy. 
Both sides now face a new threat in the form of the progressive and youthful Move Forward party, which has brought them together. 
It is no coincidence that Mr Thaksin returned on the same day Pheu Thai's candidate was voted the country's next PM. Property developer Srettha Thavisin, was approved by a substantial majority, enabled by a coalition, which includes parties that were once Mr Thaksin's bitterest foes.
That Mr Thaksin arrived several hours before the vote suggests he was confident of the outcome. And that he knew this deal between once irreconcilable adversaries was solid, that by the end of the day he would enjoy the protection of having his own party in office. 
So Thailand finally has a government, more than three months after the election. But Thai people can be forgiven for thinking this is not what they voted for. It does not include the party that won the most seats - Move Forward - which was blocked by the military-appointed senate from forming a government. 
But it does include most of the parties from the outgoing, military-backed administration - even those led by two of the coup-makers responsible for ousting the last Pheu Thai government in 2014, and for the military operation against pro-Thaksin protesters in 2010 which killed dozens of people. 
For Pheu Thai's grass-roots ""red shirt"" supporters this will be a bitter pill to swallow, and many say they will stop backing the party. 
The new government is also likely to allocate strategically important ministries like defence and interior to the conservative parties as part of the grand bargain. Pheu Thai's past promises of reform, like amending the military-drafted constitution, may fall by the wayside when it encounters opposition from its coalition partners.
Given the high hopes of a fresh new start for Thailand when Move Forward stunned everyone, including its own young candidates, with its election victory in May, this is a dismal outcome for many Thai voters.
""So the people voted for the number one party, just for it to be in opposition? Then why even have an election?"", wrote one exasperated person on Twitter.
""It's like winning the world cup on penalties"", wrote another. ""This is nothing to be proud of"".
""I have never regretted voting for Move Forward"", said another. ""At least it showed some people's true colours. The next election will be a landslide for Move Forward!""
There has been angry talk of a stab-in-the-back by Pheu Thai, which initially pledged to join a Move Forward-led coalition, and of Pheu Thai selling out.
But Mr Thaksin's election-winning machine was never a radical or progressive party, in the way that Move Forward aspires to be. 
It was a populist party with brilliantly-marketed policies, which initially lifted the living standards of previously neglected parts of the Thai population, and which, for 20 years, gave it an unassailable edge over its rivals. 
But it was always pragmatic, not ideological. And it has always been swayed primarily by the interests of the Shinawatra family, who have remained its main source of funding and its most important decision-makers.
This year's election was the first since the 1990s that a Shinawatra party did not win the largest share of seats in parliament. It was a wake-up call. 
Other parties have borrowed Pheu Thai's signature populist policies, and Move Forward, with its far-reaching agenda for change, gained millions of voters, mainly at Pheu Thai's expense. Mr Thaksin and the conservatives both saw a threat from the same quarter, and decided to bury the hatchet to confront it.
The new government is likely to focus its early efforts on the Thai economy, with the hope that making people feel better off will help them forget the unseemly way this coalition was brought about.
But holding this disparate alliance of parties together will be a challenge, especially for the new PM, Mr Srettha. He has little political experience, is not popular with some even in his own party, and will be hostage to the wishes of the Shinawatra family, just as Mr Thaksin is hostage to his own need to stay out of jail. 
Hoping to get out policies with enough wow factor to win over Thailand's disillusioned voters may be unrealistic.
And Mr Srettha will face an opposition in Move Forward that is motivated to show the Thai people what a poor outcome they have got from their election. 
In the last parliament Move Forward already showed itself to be skilled at skewering the hypocrisy and false promises which are a hallmark of Thai politics. They will do it again. 
Earlier this month the deputy speaker, a Move Forward MP, used the entertainment budget that comes with his post to lay on a barbecue meal for 370 cleaning staff at the parliament, the first time, they say, that their work has been recognised in this way. 
This compassionate but clever move has now started a public debate about how Thai MPs use their expenses, showing the idealistic and frugal Move Forward MPs to their advantage. 
In the past it is something that Pheu Thai, with its cherished label as a champion of the downtrodden, might have been expected to think of. 
That it came instead from Move Forward is perhaps a sign of the shifting political sands in Thailand.

Dalton Tagelagi was elected premier by Niue's legislative assembly in June 2020 following the May general election.
He is a bowls player and has competed for Niue at the 2014, 2018 and 2022 Commonwealth Games.
Most of Niue's media is government-owned and funded. Expansion of the internet has led to a growth in online media.
The Broadcasting Corporation of Niue (BCN) runs the island's only television network Television Niue and Radio Sunshine.
The Niue Star is the country's only independent source of print news. 
Key dates in Niue's history:
c. 900AD - Polynesians from Samoa settle on Niue.
16th Century - Further round of migration from Tonga.
1774 - Britain's Captain James Cook makes three attempts to land, but the inhabitants refuse him permission to do so. He supposedly names the island ""Savage Island"" because, the Niueans were painted in what appeared to be blood - in fact a red banana.
19th Century - British missionaries arrive.
1889 - Niuean leaders request protection for the island by the UK.
1900 - A petition by Cook Islanders to the UK asking for annexation also includes Niue. Niue is briefly a British protectorate.
1901 - Niue is brought within the boundaries of New Zealand and the island is subsequently administered from New Zealand. 
1974 - Niue votes to become an autonomous region under the sovereignty of New Zealand.
2003 - Niue becomes the world's first country to offer a free wireless internet service to all residents.

Ukraine war: Three killed in Belgorod hours after drones hit Moscow,"This video can not be played
Watch the moment a drone hits an unfinished building in Russia's capital
A drone attack on Russia's Belgorod region has killed three people, hours after another drone hit central Moscow, Russian officials say.
Belgorod's Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov blamed Kyiv for the attack on the region, near Ukraine's border.
""Ukrainian forces launched an explosive device through a drone while people were on the street,"" he claimed.
Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for either incident, but it rarely comments on attacks inside Russia.
Hours after the first drone attack which killed three in Belgorod a second drone was destroyed over the region, the Russian Defence Ministry said. 
As well as the drone strikes on Belgorod, drones were also reported in Moscow, where a building that was under construction was hit, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.
Air defences also shot down two drones earlier in the Mozhaisk and Khimki districts of the Moscow region, the defence ministry added. No casualties were reported.
Following the incident in Russia's capital, all flights to and from Moscow's airports were suspended early on Wednesday, thought they later returned to normal. 
The flight suspension measures have been taken repeatedly in recent days amid a spate of drone attacks on the capital.
It was the sixth consecutive night of aerial attacks on the Moscow region, the AFP news agency reported.
The drone that hit the building under construction at the Moscow city complex was suppressed by electronic warfare systems, the defence ministry said. It lost control and collided with the building, officials added.
Several windows were smashed in two five-storey buildings opposite the site and emergency services were inspecting the area, Mr Sobyanin said.
In response to reports of the downed drones, the US State Department said the US did not encourage drone attacks in Russia.
US officials added it was up to Ukraine to decide how to defend itself, and that Russia could end the war at any time by withdrawing its forces from its neighbour.
Allegations of drone strikes inside Russia have become increasingly common in recent months.
On Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry said it had downed two drones over the Moscow region, and two more were intercepted over the Bryansk region near the Ukrainian border.
Officials also said a Russian warplane had destroyed a Ukrainian reconnaissance boat in the Black Sea that sailed near Russian gas production facilities on Tuesday.
Ukraine did not claim responsibility for any drone incursions on Tuesday - but President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"".

Wiltshire charity transports donated fridges to Ukraine,"Three trucks are transporting fridges and other essential supplies to Ukraine to help people affected by the war.
The Wiltshire based charity, UK to Ukraine, has collected about 17 fridges and freezers from local people. 
Residents living near the Kakhovka Dam, which was breached in June, will be given the supplies.
Henrietta Nettlefold, from the charity, said: ""When the dam was blown up, people's houses were completely ruined and they are living hand to mouth.""
As well as fridges, the charity is sending a rescue vehicle, clothes and medical supplies.
The trucks set off from Chichester on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Nettlefold said the response had been ""fantastic"" and those who have donated have been ""absolutely extraordinary"".
The charity works in partnership with Stay Safe, an organisation based on the eastern border of Ukraine. 
Stay Safe is working to rehouse and resettle people in the area whilst also providing up to 150 hot meals a day. 
Ms Nettflefold said: ""There are many people there who are living in absolute desperate situations while they try and get rehoused.
""We cannot thank Wiltshire and the surrounding counties enough.
""We will continue to provide aid in delivering what we can to the front line. 
""We will do whatever they tell us they need.""

South Koreans unfazed by first nationwide air raid drill in six years,"South Korea's first nationwide air-raid drill in six years has met with a tepid public response, even amid a looming satellite launch by the North.
At 2pm local time on Wednesday, vehicles were ordered to pull over and people told to evacuate to air raid shelters during the 20-minute exercise. 
It is part of wider military exercises aimed at improving the country's response to a North Korean attack.  
Pyongyang claims it will soon launch a rocket carrying a satellite.
The drill, which used to be held annually, was a chance to remind people what to do in the event of an attack from the North.
As Pyongyang builds up its arsenal of nuclear weapons, it poses an ever-greater risk to the South. But people here, who have lived with the threat of war for decades, are increasingly desensitised to the danger.  
As sirens sounded, police jumped into the street to stop traffic, while public officials tried to usher people into nearby subway stations.
At the station in central Seoul that BBC News visited, only a dozen people had gathered to seek shelter. 
""This is necessary because we are nervous about North Korea and this acts as a reminder for us, to raise awareness"", said 24-year-old university student Kim Min-jun, who was among the dozen.
20-year-old Choi Bo-geun, who came to the shelter with his friend, agreed. ""Since we are still at war with the North this training is necessary, but I worry that this sort of thing might provoke North Korea. Since we are also holding joint military exercises with the US, this escalates the chances of war"".
But above ground, many continued with their journeys as usual. 
Yang Anna was in a coffee shop when the alarm sounded. ""I don't know where the shelter is, so I didn't go. I don't know why we have to do these drills. I don't think a war is going to happen"".
80-year-old Park Hyung-joon did not seek shelter either. He said he thought the drills played an important role in protecting people and the country, but that he had been drinking tea with his friends at the time and did not want to leave.
Local media reported that some 17,000 spots, such as apartment basements and subway stations, were set as defense drill shelters in 2022.

India Moon mission lander Vikram aims for historic lunar south pole landing,"India is hoping to make history on Wednesday by becoming the first nation to land near the Moon's south pole.
One of the mission's major goals is to hunt for water-based ice, which scientists say could support human habitation on the Moon in future.
If Chandrayaan-3 is successful, India will be only the fourth country to have achieved a soft landing on the Moon.
India's attempt comes just days after Russia's Luna-25 crashed while trying to touch down in the same region.
The south pole of the Moon holds special promise in the search for water ice. The surface area that remains in permanent shadow there is huge, and scientists say it means there is a possibility of water in these areas.
The US, the former Soviet Union and China have all achieved a soft landing near the Moon's equator - but none have led successful missions to its south pole.
India's attempt to land its Chandrayaan-2 mission near the south pole in 2019 was unsuccessful - it crashed into the lunar surface.
So all eyes are now on Chandrayaan-3 - its third mission to the little-explored Moon.
The spacecraft with an orbiter, lander and a rover lifted off on 14 July from the Sriharikota space centre in south India.
The lander - called Vikram after Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) founder Vikram Sarabhai - carries within its belly the 26kg rover named Pragyaan, the Sanskrit word for wisdom.
Once the descent starts, the lander's speed will be gradually reduced from 1.68km per second at its present height to almost zero by the time it reaches 800m, Isro's Nilesh M Desai told ANI news agency.
A call will then be made about its landing location once Vikram has travelled down to a height of 150m. If the area is found unsuitable, the lander will move a little to the left or the right to find a more suitable landing spot. If all fails, the emergency mode will kick in which will help with a safe landing, Mr Desai said.
Once it lands and the dust settles, the six-wheeled rover will crawl out of its belly and roam around the rocks and craters on the Moon's surface, gathering crucial data and images to be sent to the lander, which will pass it on to the orbiter to send to Earth.
The rover's wheels have the Isro's logo and emblem embossed on them so that they leave imprints on the lunar soil during the Moon walk, an official told the BBC.
Chandrayaan-3's journey to the Moon has generated a lot of excitement in India, with wishes for the mission's success pouring in from across the country.  
Isro has announced plans for a live telecast of the landing and millions of people, including schoolchildren, are expected to tune in.
On Tuesday, Isro chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath told the Hindustan Times he was ""extremely confident of a successful landing"" because they had made ""back-ups of the back-up plans"".
He said they had carefully studied the data from the Chandrayaan-2 crash and carried out simulation exercises to fix the glitches.
In the past few days, the Vikram lander's camera has been extensively mapping the lunar surface while attempting to locate a safe landing spot.
In its update on Tuesday, Isro said the mission ""is on schedule, systems are undergoing regular checks and smooth sailing is continuing"".
Mr Somanath has said Chandrayaan-3 will work to build on the success of India's earlier Moon missions and help make some ""very substantial"" scientific discovery. 
Chandrayaan-1, the country's first Moon mission in 2008, discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime.
And despite failing the soft landing, Chandrayaan-2 was not a complete write-off - its orbiter continues to circle the Moon even today and will help the Vikram lander send images and data to Earth for analysis. 
The lander and the rover are carrying five scientific instruments which will help discover ""the physical characteristics of the surface of the Moon, the atmosphere close to the surface and the tectonic activity to study what goes on below the surface"". 
The landing date has been carefully selected to coincide with the start of a lunar day. 
A day on the Moon equals a little over four week on Earth and this will mean the lander and rover will have 14 days of sunlight to charge their batteries. Once night falls, they will discharge and stop working. 
It is not yet clear whether they will come back to life when the next lunar day starts.
India is not the only country with an eye on the Moon - there's a growing global interest in it, with many other missions headed to the lunar surface in the near future. And scientists say there is still much to understand about the Moon, which is often described as a gateway to deep space. 
A successful Chandrayaan-3, they say, will take us a step closer in that quest.

India's Chandrayaan-3 mission has made history by landing safely near the south pole of the Moon. We'll soon be closing our live coverage, but here's a quick recap before we go:
Rebecca Morelle
Science editor
The lunar south pole is a desolate place - its surface,
strewn with boulders and pitted with giant craters, sees little sunlight.
But there are riches to be had there.
It’s thought to hold important minerals - and some are
eyeing the polar region as a site for future mining.
But its most important resource is its water. The huge
craters - permanently in shadow - hold ice.
And not only would this be vital for human visitors - Nasa’s
Artemis mission is eventually aiming for a moon base here - but water when it’s
split into hydrogen and oxygen could be used as a future fuel for hopping off
to other parts of the solar system.
But the water also holds some scientific treasures too.
It’s thought that water on the Moon comes from space rocks
that crashed into the lunar surface early in its history – and it’s been
preserved, frozen in time.
And studying it could give us new insight into the
beginnings of the solar system.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov have offered their congratulations to India for its successful soft-landing on the Moon, days after the Russian attempt spiralled out of control and crashed.
Putin sent his ""heartfelt congratulations"" to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and said the success was a ""testament to the impressive progress made by India"", Russia's state-owned news agency Tass quoted the Kremlin as saying.
Lavrov told his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar: ""I salute you. Really, really impressive. Congratulations.""
Russian space agency Roscosmos also sent its congratulations to the Indian space agency.
A little while ago we brought you images taken by the lander as it descended - India's space agency Isro has tweeted an image showing the landing site.
One of the legs of the Vikram lander is visible, as well as its shadow.
The image was taken by the craft's camera after it successfully landed on a ""relatively flat"" part of the Moon's surface, according to the tweet by Isro.

There are several pieces of evidence consistent with water on the Moon, says Simeon Barber, a planetary scientist at the UK's Open University, who also works with the European Space Agency.
In 2018, data from a Nasa instrument carried by Chandrayaan-1 revealed water ice or hydroxyl - a molecule containing one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom -  in parts of the Moon that are permanently shadowed. 
Data from Nasa's LCROSS satellite, which crashed into a crater near the Moon’s south pole in 2009, also showed water ice in the plume kicked up on impact. 
Scientists have lab analyses of lunar samples (Apollo, Luna missions) and meteorites which show elevated levels of water in some parts of the sample like volcanic glass beads.
""All of the above could be explained by water or hydroxyl on the Moon, controlled by temperature differences - but the different data sets do not always correlate neatly,"" Prof Barber says.
The importance of lander missions such as Chandrayaan-3 is that
they will provide ""ground truth"" for all of these remote measurements -
providing detail at the very local scale.
But the main caveat is that neither Chandrayaan-3 nor the doomed
Luna-25 had payloads ""optimised"" for the detection and measurement of water
ice, Prof Barber says.
""They will provide unique information, but we still need
dedicated instruments to be landed on the Moon to make more precise
measurements.""
These Images, taken during the Chandrayaan-3
lander's descent to the Moon, have just been released.
Isro shared the pictures on social media and says they were taken by the lander's horizontal velocity camera.
We've just heard from Dr Raji Rajagopalan, director of the Centre for Security, Strategy and Technology at the Observer Research Foundation think tank, based in Delhi.
She says the moon landing is not only a matter of national pride, but shows the world how sophisticated and mature India's space program is. 
""This is a validation of many of the advanced technologies that the space agency has developed,"" Rajagopalan says.
When India's space programme began, interplanetary or deep space missions were not part of the goals, but the development of its capabilities has established it as a global space power.
""India's attempt is not duplicating what others have done, but complementing it: we want to expand humanity's understanding of the lunar surface,"" she adds.
Only four countries have successfully landed a craft on the moon - the US, the former Soviet Union, China and now India. 
India, however, is the first to land a spacecraft on the lunar south pole. 
Take a closer look at all the successful landings. 
The Moon's south pole, according to Nasa, is full of ""mystery, science and intrigue"".
There are deep craters which have been shielded from sunlight for billions of years, where temperatures can plummet to astonishing lows of -248C (-414F).
Water is one key reason why scientists want to explore the area around the lunar south pole.
Scientists believe frozen water might have accumulated in cold polar regions over millions of years and could provide a unique sample for scientists to analyse and understand the history of water in our solar system.
If the water ice on the Moon turns out to be possible to extract, some hope it could eventually be used by astronauts, reducing the amount of water that would have be blasted into space on crewed missions.
Also, water molecules can be broken into hydrogen and oxygen atoms - which could perhaps one day be used as propellants for rockets.

Now that the Vikram lander had touched down, it will have to wait for a few hours for the dust to settle. Literally. 
After that, panels on one of its sides will open and a ramp will be deployed to enable Pragyaan, the rover, to slide down to the surface.
It will then begin the Moon walk - moving at a speed of 1cm per second, it will roam around the rocks and craters, gathering crucial data and images. 
Pragyaan will only communicate with the lander which will send the information to the orbiter from Chandrayaan-2 - which is still circling the Moon - to pass it on to the Earth for analysis.
The
landing coincides with the start of a lunar day – a day on the Moon equals 28
days on Earth and this will mean the lander and rover will have 14 days of
sunlight to charge their batteries. Once night falls, they will discharge and
stop working. It is not yet clear whether they will come back to life when the
next lunar day starts.
The lander and the rover are carrying five scientific instruments which will help find out what goes on the Moon's surface and above and below it. 
Both the US space agency, Nasa, and the European space agency helped Isro scientists to track the Chandrayaan-3 mission at times when it was out of the vision of India's own space tracking station.
Now the heads of both have expressed enthusiastic congratulations on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Congratulations @isro on your successful  Chandrayaan-3 lunar South Pole landing! And congratulations to #India on being the 4th country to successfully soft-land a spacecraft on the Moon. We’re glad to be your partner on this mission!
The director general of the European Space Agency, Josef Aschbacher, also thanks ESA Operations for their ""precious support"" in this process.
""We, too, are learning great lessons and providing crucial expertise,"" he adds.
Incredible! Congratulations to @isro, #Chandrayaan_3, and to all the people of India!! What a way to demonstrate new technologies AND achieve India's first soft landing on another celestial body. Well done, I am thoroughly impressed. And kudos once again to @esaoperations for your precious support through this process. We, too, are learning great lessons and providing crucial expertise.
India's President Droupadi Murmu called Chandrayaan-3's soft landing on the Moon ""a momentous occasion"".
""Our scientists have not only made history but also remade the idea of geography,"" she said.
Ms Murmu called it an event that ""happens once in a lifetime"". 
""I congratulate Isro and everybody involved in this mission and wish them greater accomplishments ahead,"" she said.
The success of Chandrayaan-3, I believe, is also a major achievement for the whole of human kind.""
The cost of India’s space missions is back in focus after the country’s Chandrayaan-3 made a successful soft landing on the Moon.
The mission costs 6.1bn rupees ($75m; £58m). This is less than half the $200m cost of Russia’s Luna-25 spacecraft which crashed on Sunday. 
India’s previous Moon and Mars missions were also carried out at a modest cost, according to reports by Indian media.
They attribute this to Isro's efforts to prevent “wastage of products”.
Explaining why India’s Mars mission cost less than its US counterpart, UK space scientist Prof Andrew Coates told the BBC that India restricted the payload of the Mangalyaan craft to 15kg, which kept the successful mission “small”.
India’s launch costs could go lower still as the country plans to build a new spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, senior Isro scientists told BBC Tamil. 
The port with an ideal launch location will reduce transportation costs.

When the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) was founded in 1969, its primary goal was fairly simple - to design and launch satellites for forecasting storms, mitigating floods and bolstering telecommunications in the country.
Now the space agency has made history after its Chandrayaan-3 became the first space mission to land near the south pole of the Moon
It’s a huge moment, especially for a country which operates on a fraction of what others spend on space exploration.
But behind the milestone mission, dubbed at the most ambitious yet for India, lies years of effort.
In the beginning, India space missions were carried out with the help of other countries and it wasn’t until the 1990s that Isro began to design and launch satellites on its own.
Since then the country has achieved significant milestones to emerge as a leader in space missions.
In 2009, India sent a robotic orbiter called Chandrayaan-1 to the moon, which helped discover that water ice can exist on the lunar surface.
In 2014, India successfully put a satellite into orbit around Mars, becoming the fourth nation to do so.
And in 2017, India created history by successfully launching 104 satellites on a single mission, overtaking the previous record of 37 satellites launched by Russia in 2014.
The journey has been hardly easy - and yet here we are.
An overjoyed S Somnath, the chief of Isro, addressed a gathering
short while ago.
He began his speech by thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for
his ""endless support and faith"" in the space agency's work
""I also want to thank each and every person who prayed the
mission is a success,"" he told a beaming crowd.
""This is not our work alone, this is the work of a
generation of Isro scientists.""

This is a massive moment for India - and it bumps
them up the space superpower list.
Landing on the Moon
is far from easy – as Russia’s attempt this week highlighted – and many
missions have failed, including India’s first attempt.
But it was second
time lucky, and India now joins three other nations - the US,
the former Soviet Union and China - who’ve successfully touched down on the
lunar surface.
And they’re now ready to explore an area where no
other spacecraft has been – the lunar south pole.
There’s growing scientific interest here. The
craters in this region are permanently in shadow and contain frozen water.
This would be a crucial resource for future human
exploration - Nasa’s Artemis mission, which is sending astronauts to the Moon,
is targeting this region too.
Water would also be crucial for propelling us
further out into the solar system. 
Splitting it into its constituent parts of hydrogen
and oxygen could provide a potential fuel for exploring places like Mars and
beyond.

Tonga country profile,"A group of more than 170 islands spread over an area of the South Pacific roughly the size of Japan, Tonga is the last Polynesian monarchy.
A deeply conservative, Christian country, Tonga voted in its first popularly elected parliament in 2010, ending 165 years of feudal rule. In 2015, the country elected its first non-noble prime minister.
A former British protectorate, Tonga became fully independent in 1970, although it was never formally colonised.
Tonga has no strategic or mineral resources, and relies on agriculture, fishing and the money sent home by Tongans living abroad, many of them in New Zealand. Unemployment is high, particularly among the young.
Characterised by tropical beaches, rainforest, and active volcanoes, it has a developing tourist industry - its main source of hard currency.
Head of state: King George Tupou VI
George Tupou VI succeeded to the throne on the death of his elder brother, the bachelor George Tupou V, in March 2012.
King George Tupou V ushered in parliamentary democracy in 2010, ending centuries of feudal dominance of government.
Prime minister: Siaosi 'Ofakivahafolau Sovaleni
Mr Sovaleni became prime minister after the November 2021 elections, having served in the previous governments of Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa and 'Akalisi Pohiva.
He had fallen out with Mr Pohiva in 2017 during a power struggle between the prime minister and King George Tupou VI. 
When Mr Pohiva returned to power at the end of the year, Mr Sovaleni went into opposition, returning to government under Pohiva Tu'i'onetoa in 2019.
State radio and TV tend to be pro-government, while private broadcasters offer little independent local coverage.
Privately-owned newspapers carry opposition views, but journalists can face harassment and threats of criminal charges. A Department of Information oversees all media reporting, US-based Freedom House notes.

Uzbekistan country profile,"The land that is now Uzbekistan was once at the heart of the ancient Silk Road trade route connecting China with the Middle East and Rome. 
The country came under Russian control in the 19th Century, and emerged as an independent state when Soviet rule ended in 1991.
Under authoritarian President Islam Karimov, who ruled from 1989 until his death in 2016, Uzbekistan was reliant on exports of cotton, gas and gold to maintain its rigid, state-controlled economy. 
His successor, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has made efforts to break Uzbekistan out of its international isolation and economic stagnation, but has yet to initiate any serious political liberalisation. 
Shavkat Mirziyoyev served President Islam Karimov loyally as prime minister from 2003 to 2016, when he moved smoothly into the presidency via a deal between senior power-brokers.
He swiftly restored hitherto fraught relations with neighbouring Central Asian states, as well as Russia, China and the United States, and has sought to boost foreign investment in the moribund, state-run economy. 
President Mirziyoyev has been more cautious on political reform, but managed to out-manoeuvre and replace most senior Karimov-era officials by early 2018.
He was sworn into his second term in office, after gaining a landslide victory in the November 2021 presidential election, and then again for a renewed seven-year term in a snap July 2023 presidential election.
Uzbekistan is one of Central Asia's biggest media markets. TV is the most popular medium. The government broadcaster operates the main national networks. 
Most media outlets are linked directly or indirectly to the state. 
There were 17.1 million internet users by July 2022, around 50% of the population (Internetworldstats.com). The authorities have steadily tightened their grip on the internet, says Reporters Without Borders. 
Some key dates in Uzbekistan's history:
1st century BC - Central Asia, including present-day Uzbekistan, forms an important part of the overland Great Silk Road trade route linking China with the Middle East and imperial Rome.
7th-8th Centuries - Arabs conquer the area and convert its inhabitants to Islam. 
9th-10th Centuries - Persian Samanid dynasty becomes dominant and develops Bukhara as important centre of Islamic culture. As it declines, Turkic polities compete to fill the vacuum. 
13th-14th Centuries - Central Asia is conquered by Genghis Khan and becomes part of the Mongol empire. 
14th Century - Mongol-Turkic ruler Tamerlane establishes empire with Samarkand as its capital. 
18th-19th Centuries - Rise of independent Uzbek states of Bukhara, Kokand and Samarkand. 
18th-20th Centuries - Russia takes over vast areas of Central Asia, and the Soviet Union retains control of the region. 
1865-76 - Russians take Tashkent and make it the capital of its Turkestan Province, incorporating vast areas of Central Asia. They also make Bukhara and Khiva protectorates and annex Kokand. 
1917-1920 - Bolsheviks gradually conquer Turkestan, Bukhara and Khiva. 
1918-22 - New Communist rulers close down mosques and persecute Muslim clergy as part of secularisation campaign. 
1921-24 - Reorganisation of Soviet member-states results in the creation of Uzbekistan and its neighbours. 
1950s-80s - Cotton production boosted by major irrigation projects which, however, contribute to the drying up of the Aral Sea. 
1966 - Devastating earthquake destroys much of capital Tashkent. 
1970s-1980s - Uzbek Communist chief Sharaf Rashidov ensures the promotion of ethnic Uzbek over Russian officials. He falsifies cotton harvest figures in scandal exposed under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost. 
1989 - Islam Karimov becomes leader of the Uzbek Communist Party, and remains in power beyond independence in 1991.
2001- Uzbekistan, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan launch Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to tackle ethnic and Islamic extremism and promote trade and investment. 
2005 - Troops open fire on demonstrators in the city of Andijan, killing hundreds of people. 
2016 - Islam Karimov dies in office. Successor Shavkat Mirziyoyev eases relations with neighbouring states, and promotes economic liberalisation.

Fukushima disaster: What happened at the nuclear plant?,"On Thursday, Japan will release treated radioactive wastewater from its Fukushima nuclear power plant - the site of a meltdown disaster 12 years ago.
The United Nations atomic energy regulator says the discharge of filtered water into the Pacific Ocean is safe and will have ""negligible"" impact on people and the environment. 
But the move has drawn fierce criticism from citizens of countries in the region. It is the latest development in the continuing saga of one of the world's worst-ever nuclear disasters.
It began on 11 March 2011, when the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan struck off the country's eastern coast. 
The 9.0-magnitude quake was so forceful it shifted the Earth off its axis. It triggered a tsunami which swept over Japan's main island of Honshu, killing more than 18,000 people and wiping entire towns off the map.
At the Fukushima nuclear power plant, the gigantic wave surged over coastal defences and flooded the reactors, sparking a major disaster. Authorities set up an exclusion zone which grew larger and larger as radiation leaked from the plant, forcing more than 150,000 people to evacuate from the area.
More than a decade later, that zone remains in place and many residents have not returned. Authorities believe it will take up to 40 years to finish the work of decontamination, which has already cost Japan trillions of yen.  
The Fukushima Disaster is classified as a level seven event by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the highest such event and only the second event to meet this classification after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. 
The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant is in the town of Okuma, in Fukushima Prefecture. It sits on the country's east coast, about 220km (137 miles) north-east of the capital Tokyo.
On 11 March 2011 at 14:46 local time (05:46 GMT) the earthquake - known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, or the 2011 Tohoku earthquake - struck east of the city of Sendai, 97km north of the plant. 
Residents had just 10 minutes warning before the tsunami hit the coast.
Overall almost half-a-million people were forced to leave their homes as a result of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident.
Systems at the nuclear plant detected the earthquake and automatically shut down the reactors. Emergency diesel generators turned on to keep coolant pumping around the cores, which remain incredibly hot even after a shutdown.
But soon after a wave over 14 metres (46ft) high hit Fukushima. The water overwhelmed the defensive sea wall, flooding the plant and knocking out the emergency generators. 
Workers rushed to restore power, but in the days that followed the nuclear fuel in three of the reactors overheated and partly melted the cores - something known as a nuclear meltdown. 
The plant also suffered a number of chemical explosions which badly damaged the buildings. Radioactive material began leaking into the atmosphere and the Pacific Ocean, prompting evacuations and an ever-widening exclusion zone. 
At least 16 workers were injured in the explosions, while dozens more were exposed to radiation as they worked to cool the reactors and stabilise the plant. Three people were reportedly taken to hospital after high-level exposure.
A number of people were later confirmed to have died in the evacuation, including dozens of hospital patients who had to be moved due to fears of radiation.
The long-term effects of radiation exposure are a matter of debate. The World Health Organization (WHO) released a report in 2013 that said the disaster will not cause any observable increase in cancer rates in the region. Scientists both inside and outside Japan believe that aside from the region immediately around the plant, the risks of exposure remain relatively low. 
On 9 March 2021, ahead of the 10-year anniversary, a UN report said there had been ""no adverse health effects"" documented among Fukushima residents directly related to the radiation from the disaster. Any future radiation-related health effects were ""unlikely to be discernible"", it said. 
But many believe the dangers are far greater, and residents remain wary. Though officials have lifted restrictions in many areas most people have not returned to their homes. 
In 2018, the Japanese government announced that one worker had died after exposure to radiation and agreed that his family should be compensated.
Critics blamed a lack of preparedness for the event, as well as a muddled response from both the plant operator Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) and the government. 
An independent investigation by Japan's parliament concluded that Fukushima was ""a profoundly man-made disaster"", blaming the energy company for failing to meet safety requirements or to plan for such an event. However, in 2019 a Japanese court cleared three former Tepco executives of negligence in what was the only criminal case to come out of the disaster.
In 2012, Japan's then prime minister Yoshihiko Noda said the state shared the blame for the disaster. A court ruled in 2017 that the government bore partial responsibility and should pay compensation to evacuees.
These days, several towns in north-eastern Japan remain off limits. Authorities are working to clean up the area so residents can return. 
Some have decided never to return because they fear radiation, have built new lives elsewhere or don't want to go back to where the disaster hit.
Major challenges remain. Tens of thousands of workers will be needed over the next 30 to 40 years to safely remove nuclear waste, fuel rods and more than one million tons of radioactive water still being kept at the site. 
The water used to cool the highly radioactive reactors was mixed with groundwater and rain and stored in tanks at the plant but Japan says it's run out of space.
As such the wastewater is being released into the Pacific Ocean -  heavily filtered to reduce radioactivity.
Operators argue the huge ocean will dilute the water and that it would pose a low risk to human and animal health. However, there remain critics and sceptics of the plan.

We're going to leave our live coverage of the war in Ukraine here for now, thanks for following along. 
There's been a lot to digest today, so here's where to go if you want to keep reading. 
Start here: A drone attack on Russia's Belgorod region, which killed three people, remained a key line throughout the day.
Another interesting development: One of Russia's leading military figures, Gen Sergei Surovikin, has reportedly been fired as air force chief after weeks of speculation about his disappearance from public view.
And if you started the day unsure what the Brics summit was, this video does a good job of explaining just that.
Today's page was written by Thomas Mackintosh, Malu Cursino, Liv McMahon, Jamie Moreland, Jacqueline Howard, Joel Guinto and Jack Burgess. It was edited by Jamie Whitehead and myself. 
In the UK, an inquest in Oxford has heard how a
former British paratrooper died from head and chest injuries while fighting for
the Ukrainian army in Donetsk.
Simon Lingard was killed on 7 November, 2022, on the eastern frontline in Bakhmut.

We reported earlier on Russian state media claiming that a senior general had been sacked from his latest role as head of Russia’s air force chief. Here's some more on that now.
For several months, Gen Sergei Surovikin was in charge of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine but he has not been seen since the Wagner mutiny in June. Observers believe his removal dates back to the botched rebellion.
During the hours Wagner mercenaries marched towards Moscow on 24 June, Gen Surovikin appeared in a video appealing to them to return to base.
His awkward performance was later compared to a hostage-style video. The general was known to have good relations with Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who reserved his loathing for other figures in the defence hierarchy.
In the weeks after the June revolt, there were unconfirmed reports by Russian military bloggers Gen Surovikin had been detained for questioning. But, officials denied he was being held in a pre-trial detention centre and one retired general said he was merely ""resting"" and unavailable.
Ria Novosti agency said he had been relieved of his post, citing a source.
Damaged Russian armoured vehicles will be on display in Ukraine's capital
tomorrow as the country marks its annual Independence Day. 
It's been 32 years since Ukraine became independent from the Soviet Union, following its collapse in 1991. 
Seized vehicles are
being placed along Khreshchatyk Street in Kyiv, as the government shows its
citizens Russia's losses since it invaded their country last February.
Last year the public holiday took place six months after Russia's
invasion and there were restrictions in place due to heightened security
threats.
Those celebrations were also marked in many countries, including the UK, Germany and
Greece.
More from Ukraine now. Four educational workers have been killed and four other people injured in an attack on a school in the north of the country, Interior
Minister Ihor Klymenko says.
Rescuers found the bodies of the ""school director, deputy director, secretary and librarian"" under the rubble, he writes on Telegram, with accompanying images appearing to show the school in Romny destroyed and
emergency workers carrying a body on a stretcher.
The regional military administration says a drone fired by
Russia hit the school at 10:05 this morning (08:05 BST).
""The school building was destroyed - this is just before
the school year, which unfortunately will never start for some,"" Ukrainian
human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets has said of the attack. 
Throughout the war, Russian has denied deliberately targeting civilians.
If you're just joining us, or need an afternoon catch-up, here are some of the day's key developments.
Footage released by Ukraine's military intelligence - and authenticated by
BBC Verify - shows the moment a large explosion hits Russian-occupied territory in
Crimea.
As we reported earlier, Ukrainian authorities said a Russian air
defence missile system was hit in a strike near the village of Olenivka at
about 10am local time (08:00 BST). The village sits in western Crimea, near the Tarkhankut peninsula. 
Watch the short clip
here:
In the last few minutes, Volodymyr Zelensky has spoken to reporters following a meeting with Lithuania's President Gitanas Nauseda during which the pair discussed the future of Crimea.
The Ukrainian leader vowed to end Russia's occupation of the
Crimean peninsula and all other areas that Moscow controls in his
country.
""Crimea will be de-occupied like all other parts of Ukraine
that are unfortunately still under the occupier,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. 
The meeting formed part of an international conference, reported to have been attended virtually by a number of world leaders.
Crimea was seized and annexed by Russia in 2014 in a move
not recognised by most other countries - there's more on that in our earlier post. 
An overnight attack on the port of Izmail, located on the Danube River in southern Ukraine, has reduced its export capacity by 15% and destroyed 13,000 tonnes of grain, a Ukrainian government official says.
Ukraine's minister for infrastructure Oleksandr Kubrakov said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that 270,000 tonnes of grain have been destroyed since Russia's withdrawal from a UN-brokered deal ensuring the safe passage of exports across the Black Sea in July.
He said the attack was the eighth on Ukraine's port infrastructure since the deal's collapse.
""These are attacks on countries across Africa and Asia that are already running out of food as well as on global food markets, leading to a surge in wheat prices,"" Kubrakov said, adding:
Preventing further destruction is a task not only for Ukraine but for the world.""
Robert Greenall
Live reporter
While speaking to the Brics summit, Vladimir Putin once again set out his view of the events leading up to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 - and ultimately its full-scale invasion of Ukraine eight years later. 
The Russian president says that the overthrow of Kyiv's pro-Russian government in 2014 was instigated by the West. He describes those events, known as the Maidan Revolution, as a ""coup d'etat"", but here's a reminder of what actually happened.
They began with quite small protests against the government after it refused a deal on closer ties with the EU. But the demonstrations grew into the hundreds of thousands because of popular outrage at police brutality.
From discontent over a single policy, it became a genuine popular movement - a broad protest against a regime seen as authoritarian and corrupt.
Pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia after the revolution, continued to enjoy popular support in eastern parts of the country, at least while he was in office. 
But for much of the country he was a figure of hate - probably more disliked for his lavish lifestyle and corrupt politics than for his pro-Russian stance.
As we said earlier, Vladimir Putin was not able to attend the Brics summit in person in South Africa because he's accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court (ICC) - notably the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.
Here's a reminder of how that played out. The ICC says the crimes were allegedly committed in Ukraine from 24 February 2022 - when Russia launched its full-scale invasion.
Russia's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also wanted by the ICC for the same crimes. In the past, she has spoken openly of efforts to indoctrinate Ukrainian children taken to Russia.
ICC prosecutor Karim Khan previously told the BBC: ""Children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported. This type of crime doesn't need one to be a lawyer, one needs to be human being to know how egregious it is.""
But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said any of the court's decisions were ""null and void"" and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev compared the warrant to toilet paper.
More on that reported strike in Crimea now. 
A Russian air defence missile system has been hit in a strike near the village of Olenivka, which sits near Cape Tarkhankut on the Crimean peninsula, according to Ukrainian authorities.
They say there was an explosion around 10am local time (08:00 BST).
""This is a painful blow to the air defence system of the occupiers,"" Ukraine's defence ministry said in a short statement. Russia is yet to comment on the incident. 
We'll bring you more on this when we have it.

It's just gone midday here in London and my colleagues who got this page up and running earlier have been instructed to enjoy a well-earned break.
I'm taking over editing now, and will guide you through our coverage of the war in Ukraine and any other developments at the Brics summit for the rest of the day. First, let's have a quick look at where things stand. 
We've heard from all the major Brics players, including Russian President Vladimir Putin who used a virtual appearance to repeat claims he has long made that the West is responsible for the war in Ukraine, not him. 
Meanwhile on the ground in Ukraine - in Russian-occupied Crimea, to be exact - a Russian air defence missile system has been hit in a strike near the village of Olenivka. We'll bring you more on that in our next post.
Not for the first time, Vladimir Putin has blamed Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on the West.
In his analysis, the crisis began with the change of government in Ukraine in 2014 - what Putin called a ""coup d'etat"" (read more about the beginning of the Ukrainian protests here).
After the change of government, Russia illegally annexed Crimea, had proxy forces capture parts of Ukraine's east, and launched its bloody full-scale invasion in 2022.
There was some
confusion earlier over whether the Chinese President, Xi Jinping would actually
speak today, but he has just addressed the group.
He began by saying
they are gathered at a time where the world has entered “a new period of
turbulence and transformation”.
Much of Xi’s speech
was focused on peace and development, emphasising that Brics should “bring to
the world more certainty, stability and positive energy.”
He spoke about
China setting up a science and innovation park, as well as plans to work
together on satellite network and artificial intelligence innovation.
The Chinese president
then moved onto security. He said a “cold war mentality is still haunting our
world”, urging members to keep to “peaceful development”.
Xi ended with an ancient Chinese
saying: “Designs for justice prevail and acts for the benefit of the people
succeed.”
South Africa's President
Cyril Ramaphosa took a moment to congratulate India's Prime Minister Narendra
Modi on the country's upcoming attempt to land Chandrayaan-3 on the moon today.
""This for us,
as the Brics family, is a momentous occasion and we rejoice with you,"" he
said.
India is hoping to be the first
country to land a spacecraft near the south pole of the moon today, our colleagues in
Delhi are covering that live here 
It's India's Prime
Minister Narendra Modi's turn to speak, and he begins by congratulating the
Brics bloc on its recent achievements.
These include the
New Development Bank, which Modi says plays an important role in the development
of the countries in the global south. ""We have created a financial safety
net,"" he says.
Cooperation in
outer space is the first of Modi's suggestions for Brics to consider. He
suggests the creation of a Brics satellite constellation, and a ""Space
Exploration Consortium"".
Further suggestions
from Modi include investment in technology to further education in Brics
countries, better identification of the skills each member country brings to
the table, a central repository of traditional medicines, and cooperation on
protection of big cats.
To that, Ramophosa
quips: ""If you need more cheetahs, you have come to the home of
cheetahs,"" eliciting laughs from the room.
Finally, Modi says
India fully supports the expansion of Brics through extending memberships to
other countries.
After blaming the West for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Putin says a priority
for Brics is the establishment of new, sustainable, safe transport routes, such
as the “north-south corridor” that would link Russian ports to sea terminals in
the gulf and Indian ocean.
He also discusses ""bolstered partnership in science and innovation, healthcare, education, the development of humanitarian ties in general, cultural and civilisational diversity"".
And now, it's Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's turn to address the summit.
President Putin now claims some countries ""promote colonialism"" which led to a ""dire crisis"" in Ukraine.
He says Russia's actions in Ukraine are in response to a war ""unleashed"" by the West.
He says their ""aspiration"" to ""preserve their hegemony in the world"", led to a coup d'etat in Ukraine (in 2014).
""Russia decided to support people that fight for their culture, for their traditions, for their language, and for their future,"" he claims.
He says Russia's actions in Ukraine are desigined to put ""put an end to the war that was unleashed by the West against people in Donbas [in eastern Ukraine]"".
President Putin continues, saying the Brics summit ""stands for world order based on international law and UN charter"" - and the rights of people to their own development.

Andrew Tate prosecution files reveal graphic claims of coercion ahead of trial,"Details of graphic evidence compiled by Romanian prosecutors, alleging that Andrew Tate coerced women into sexual acts, have been seen by the BBC.
Warning: This article contains language and details that some readers may find disturbing
The case file summary, containing hundreds of pages of testimony and transcripts, includes an allegation of sexual violence which is said to have left one woman with eye and breast injuries. 
And in what prosecutors say are transcribed audio messages, Mr Tate's brother Tristan appears to say that he will ""slave these bitches"". 
Both men are facing trial in Romania for human trafficking and forming an organised criminal group with two other defendants.
Andrew Tate is also facing a charge of rape. 
They deny all the charges against them. Some of the messages may originally have been written or recorded in English, then translated into Romanian by prosecutors and re-translated back into English by the BBC.
The BBC cannot verify whether the messages have been accurately transcribed or whether they were sent by the defendants as claimed, because the original evidence is not included in the summary document.
The 300 pages of reported testimony and evidence seen by the BBC provide a rare glimpse inside the pre-trial prosecution case against Andrew Tate, whose controversial views and online influence have sparked warnings from teachers, police and rights groups.
Included in the summary is a reproduced text message in which Mr Tate appears to claim leadership of the adult content business that prosecutors say was a human trafficking ring.
In June, Romania's Organised Crime Unit formally charged the Tate brothers, along with two Romanian women, with human trafficking and forming an organised crime group.  
Attending court for the indictment, Andrew Tate said they were ""not the first affluent men to be unfairly attacked"" and that he looked forward to being found innocent.  
Earlier this summer, Romanian prosecutors said in a statement that the Tate brothers had recruited their alleged victims by misleading them about their romantic intentions, before transporting the women to a house on the outskirts of Bucharest - where they were sexually exploited by the group, and forced to produce pornographic content through physical violence and mental coercion.
The Tates' lawyers are expected to challenge the prosecution evidence in a pre-trial hearing later this month, and some of the material referred to in the case file seen by the BBC could be ruled inadmissible. 
Even if the material is found to be admissible, the defendants may challenge it during trial. 
The defendants may dispute that they made these statements and contest their accuracy or context. They may also contest whether they meet the required legal standard for any offence being committed.
The file seen by the BBC includes testimony from what prosecutors say are several women who lived in a building near the Tates' house on the outskirts of Bucharest. The women allege that income from their online pornographic content was controlled by the defendants, along with some accounts and passwords.
Prosecutors say access to the money made on the OnlyFans site was controlled by Georgiana Naghel, one of the Tates' two Romanian co-defendants. 
She would pay the women in the OnlyFans videos sums of money each month without revealing the total income they had earned, prosecutors allege. 
On content created for the TikTok platform, they say the defendants took 50% of the income - and sometimes more.  
Witnesses also claim they were forced to produce specific content to a strict schedule, under the threat of verbal and physical abuse.  
The case file refers to threats to ""break your teeth"" or ""end up in the morgue"" in transcribed text messages, said to be from Ms Naghel.
She is also facing a charge of physically assaulting one victim - which she denies.
Fines of about 10% were imposed by the defendants on the women performing online for even small infractions - such as staying too long on a break, crying while live online, or wiping their nose while live, one witness says.
This apparently resulted in one of the women owing about €4,000 (£3,412) in debts.
A lawyer for the two female defendants said they vehemently denied the allegations which were not supported by any evidence, and were waiting for the court to decide their innocence.
The prosecutors' file also contains what is claimed to be transcriptions of audio messages from 2020 - in which Tristan Tate appears to say he doesn't want the women on sites like PornHub and OnlyFans to have access to their accounts:
""I don't want them to have the passwords, I don't want them to have anything."" 
And:
""I don't want to tell them that they have OnlyFans, I want that money to be used by me and you, screw them…""
Another part of the transcript reads:
""Mainly I'm going to slave these bitches […] I'm going to make them work even more hours and hours and hours.. I work these bitches like slaves. […] SLAVE work.  Minimum 10 or 12 hours a day.""
The Tate brothers, and some of the women working for them, previously told investigators that the allegations are the result of jealousy.

And two of the women, classed as victims by prosecutors, say they did not share their income with anyone. Both women have publicly emphasised their close personal ties to the men, and support for them. 
Prosecutors will also seek to build up a picture of controlling behaviour and heavy restrictions - largely through witness testimony and messages which they claim were exchanged between the various parties. 
This includes an alleged ban on newly arrived women leaving the house without permission, and needing to be accompanied by one of the Tates' trusted associates. 
They allege that after recruitment, women were placed under the supervision of the two female defendants, Ms Naghel and Luana Radu. 
The prosecutors highlight alleged text exchanges between Tristan Tate and Ms Naghel about the management of the business. 
But significantly, the files seen by the BBC contain a transcript of what is said to be a text message from one alleged victim to Andrew Tate last year, in which she asks if he's ""the one running the girl business/OnlyFans and TikTok"".
""Tristan and G are,"" Andrew appears to respond. 
""But I lead them.""
We asked the Tates for a response to these claims.  A spokeswoman said in a statement that they vehemently denied the serious allegations against them.  She accused the BBC of a lack of impartiality, saying there was ""substantial evidence pointing to their innocence"", without giving any detail, or addressing the specific allegations raised.
In other transcribed messages that prosecutors say took place between this alleged victim and Andrew Tate over several weeks, Mr Tate appears to mix talk of love and marriage with what seem to be orders, threats, references to rape, or insults such as ""bitch"" or ""whore"".
According to the file, the alleged victim appears to ask him not to use those terms.
In response to a demand for group sex, the file says, she tells Andrew Tate, ""I will not have sex with girls. I'm not going to do this."" And then, ""Baby, I gotta drink for this. I can't do it without drinking."" 
Mr Tate is alleged to have responded, ""Don't be boring [...] I want to see that you submit to me [...] Shut up you whore, you will do as I say.""
This is not the only allegation of abuse. The case file summary also contains detailed witness accounts of Mr Tate's alleged violence towards women. 
One alleged rape victim says that, during one incident, he told her to take off her clothes while keeping her shoes on, then ""slapped her across the face"". 
She says she was unable to reject Mr Tate because he would hold her head during sex, telling her he no longer wanted to receive negative messages from her, and threatening to get her pregnant and lock her in a house. 
According to the prosecution case, the alleged victim ""was crying and scared because she thought [Andrew Tate] was capable of anything"".
The two individuals were reportedly alone in the room at the time, the file says, but prosecutors are seeking to place this testimony in the context of the defendant's reported wider behaviour and history. 
Another woman told investigators that Andrew Tate's violence during sex was his way of ""venting frustration"" when she didn't do what he told her to do.
Silvia Tabusca - an expert in human trafficking cases - told the BBC that, in order to prove their case, prosecutors would need to show that the defendants misled their alleged victims about their motivation for the relationship. Even if the women themselves consented, she said, trafficking could still take place.
In a BBC interview earlier this year, Andrew Tate strongly denied exploiting or manipulating any women, saying that he had ""never hurt anybody"" and that the case against him was ""completely and utterly fabricated"".  
He has also said repeatedly that the media and others take selected comments of his out of context and put them together in a way that doesn't reflect reality. 
The file also refers to financial transfers, including £4m allegedly transferred by Andrew Tate into an online bank account, under the heading ""Rev Only Fans"". The BBC has not seen details of the source of that income. 
In their report, prosecutors allege that the Tate brothers do not appear to have income ""from lawful activities"", but that from 2018 onwards they acquired ""numerous properties"", ""15 of the rarest and most expensive cars"", estimated to be worth more than £3m, as well as jewellery and $400,000 in cryptocurrency.
Subscriptions to their online groups, the War Room and Hustler's University, appear to bring the brothers around $5m a month in membership fees, prosecutors say.
Romania is preparing to try this case in the glare of an international spotlight. Its Organised Crime Unit confirmed in a statement earlier this year that it was continuing to investigate possible crimes of trafficking in minors and money-laundering connected to this case. As yet, no suspects have been formally identified.
The trial itself could take years to reach a verdict. 
Prosecutors say Andrew Tate's video explanations of how to recruit, control and exploit women match the evidence they present.
But supporters praise his discipline and financial success.
The online version of Andrew Tate has already divided the world into prosecution and defence.  But in the legal process that's about to begin in Bucharest, it's his real-life actions on trial.

Listeria outbreak: Three die after drinking contaminated milkshakes,"Three people have died, and three others are in hospital after drinking milkshakes contaminated with listeria bacteria in the US state of Washington, health officials say.
Investigators found the bacteria in the ice cream machines at Frugals, a popular burger and milkshakes restaurant in Tacoma.
The restaurant said in a statement it was ""deeply saddened"" by the news.
Listeria can affect people up to 70 days after consuming contaminated food.
Health officials said the ice cream machines at the Tacoma restaurant were not cleaned correctly resulting in a foodborne listeriosis outbreak.
Six people were sent to the hospital between 27 February and 22 July, the Washington State Department of Health said. Genetic fingerprinting of bacteria in the milkshakes shows it was the same strain of listeria. 
Those six people had weakened immune systems and were between the ages of 40 and 79. 
Two of the three who survived said they had a milkshake from the same Frugals restaurant before feeling symptomatic. 
In a statement, Frugals said: ""We are heartbroken and deeply regret any harm our actions could have caused.
""We are committed to making any changes deemed necessary to maintain our high standard of operations and prevent this from happening again.""
The business has stopped selling all milkshakes at the Tacoma location and has sent the milkshake equipment to an independent facility for cleaning and re-testing. As a precaution, Frugals has also halted the production of milkshakes at other locations. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,600 Americans are infected by listeria every year, and some 260 die.
Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, confusion and seizures. For those who are pregnant, symptoms can also include pregnancy loss or premature birth. 
However, most people who eat Listeria-contaminated foods will not get sick, according to health officials, except for older populations, those who are pregnant, and the immuno-compromised. 
No other Frugals restaurants are believed to have the bacteria, officials said. 
At least one lawsuit has been filed in the case, reported by local media, on behalf of a woman who claimed her husband suffered neck and arm pain until his death after drinking a Frugals milkshake. 
Food safety lawyer Bill Marler representing the family of Charles Roberson said: ""This is a really sad situation. You know, a husband and wife married for 45 years."" 
""You can't undo a death, but what you can do is make everything transparent so we can learn from this unfortunate incident,"" he said.

Mar-a-Lago IT manager implicates Trump in classified files case,"Former US President Donald Trump has been implicated by one of his employees in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, according to a court filing.
Yuscil Taveras, an IT director identified as Trump Employee 4 in legal documents, changed his testimony after switching lawyers, say prosecutors.
He now accuses Mr Trump and two aides of ""efforts to delete security camera footage"", says the filing.
The 77-year-old ex-president faces 40 charges in the case.
Mr Trump, his close personal aide Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago maintenance worker Carlos De Oliveira have all pleaded not guilty.
The former president is accused of mishandling the storage of sensitive files at his Florida estate and trying to cover up the alleged crime by deleting security footage.
The court document filed on Tuesday says Mr Taveras changed lawyers after special counsel Jack Smith, who is overseeing the case, notified him he was being investigated for perjury.  
His former lawyer also represents Mr Trump's co-defendant Mr Nauta.
During grand jury testimony in March this year, Mr Taveras ""repeatedly denied or claimed not to recall any contacts or conversations about the security footage at Mar-a-Lago"".
Prosecutors said they obtained evidence that Mr De Oliveira had asked Mr Taveras to delete the CCTV footage after investigators demanded the video as they tracked the movement of boxes containing the documents inside the resort.
The chief judge overseeing the federal grand jury, James Boasberg, offered a public defender to Mr Taveras after prosecutors pointed out a conflict of interest for his lawyer Stanley Woodward, who was being partly funded by Mr Trump's Save America political action committee.
""Advising Trump Employee 4 to correct his sworn testimony would result in testimony incriminating Mr Woodward's other client, Nauta; but permitting Trump Employee 4's false testimony to stand uncorrected would leave Trump Employee 4 exposed to criminal charges for perjury,"" the filing said. 
On 5 July, Mr Taveras informed Judge Boasberg that he no longer wished to be represented by Mr Woodward and would instead accept the offer of legal aid. 
""Immediately after receiving new counsel, Trump Employee 4 retracted his prior false testimony and provided information that implicated Nauta, [Carlos] De Oliveira, and Trump in efforts to delete security camera footage, as set forth in the superseding indictment,"" the court filing says.
Mr Taveras is not charged in the case, which is scheduled for trial next May. 
Mr Trump is fighting criminal charges in three other cases.

How South Africa's oldest Quran was saved by Cape Town Muslims,"A Quran - neatly handwritten more than 200 years ago by an Indonesian imam who had been banished to the southern tip of Africa by Dutch colonisers - is the pride of Cape Town Muslims who jealously guard it at a mosque in the city's historic Bo Kaap district. 
Builders found it in a paper bag in the Auwal Mosque's attic, while they were breaking it down as part of renovations in the mid-1980s. 
Researchers believe that Imam Abdullah ibn Qadi Abdus Salaam, affectionately known as Tuan Guru, or Master Teacher, wrote the Quran from memory at some point after he was shipped to Cape Town as a political prisoner, from Tidore island in Indonesia in 1780, as punishment for joining the resistance movement against Dutch colonisers.
""It was extremely dusty, it looked like no-one had been in that attic for more than 100 years,"" Cassiem Abdullah, a member of the mosque committee, tells the BBC. 
""The builders also found a box of religious texts written by Tuan Guru."" 
The unbound Quran, comprising loose pages that were unnumbered, was in surprisingly good condition, with the exception of the first few pages that were frayed at the edges. 
The black and red ink used for the clearly legible calligraphic writing in Arabic script was, and still is, in very good condition.
The big challenge for the local Muslim community in their quest to preserve one of the most valuable artefacts in their rich heritage, which dates back to 1694, was to ensure that all the pages containing the Quran's more than 6,000 verses were placed in the correct sequence. 
This task was undertaken by the late Maulana Taha Karaan, who was head jurist of the Cape Town-based Muslim Judicial Council, in conjunction with several local Quranic scholars. The entire process, which concluded with binding the pages, took three years to complete.
The Quran has since been displayed in the Auwal Mosque, which was established by Tuan Guru in 1794 as the first mosque in what is now South Africa. 
Three unsuccessful attempts to steal the priceless text prompted the committee to secure it in a fire- and bullet-proof casing in the front of the mosque 10 years ago. 
Tuan Guru's biographer, Shafiq Morton, believes that the scholar in all likelihood started writing the first of five copies while being held on Robben Island - where anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela was also imprisoned from the 1960s to the 1980s - and continued doing so after his release. 
Most of these copies are believed to have been written when he was between 80 and 90 years old, and his achievement is seen as all the more remarkable as Arabic was not his first language.
According to Mr Morton, Tuan Guru was jailed on Robben Island twice - first from 1780 to 1781 when he was 69 years old, and again between 1786 and 1791.  
""I believe one of the reasons he wrote the Quran was to lift the spirits of the slaves around him. He realised that if he were to write a copy of the Quran he could educate his people from it and teach them dignity at the same time,"" Mr Morton says. 
""If you go to the archives and look at the paper that the Dutch used it's very similar to that used by Tuan Guru. It's probably the same paper. 
""His pens he would have made himself from bamboo and the black and red ink would have been easy to obtain from the colonial authorities.""
Shaykh Owaisi, a lecturer in South African Islamic history who has done extensive research on handwritten Qurans in Cape Town, believes Tuan Guru was motivated by the need to preserve Islam among Muslim prisoners and slaves in what was then a Dutch colony.
""While they were preaching the Bible and trying to convert the Muslim slaves, Tuan Guru was writing the copies of the Quran, teaching it to the children and getting them to memorise it. 
""It tells a story of resilience and perseverance. It shows the level of education of the people that were brought to Cape Town as slaves and prisoners.""
Tuan Guru also penned a 613-page Arabic textbook entitled Ma'rifat wal Iman wal Islam (The Knowledge of Faith and Religion) from memory. 
The book, a basic guide to Islamic beliefs, was used for more than 100 years to teach the Muslims of Cape Town about their faith. 
It is still in good condition and is in the possession of the Rakiep family, descendants of Tuan Guru. A replica is kept in the national library in Cape Town. 
""He sat down and wrote down just about everything he could remember about his faith and he used that as a text for teaching others,"" says Shaykh Owaisi. 
Of the five copies of the Quran handwritten by Tuan Guru, three can still be accounted for. Apart from the one in the Auwal mosque, the other two are in the possession of his family, including his great-great granddaughter.
About 100 replicas have been produced. In April a one of them was handed over to the library of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem - the third holiest site in Islam - while a few have been handed over to visiting dignitaries. 
In May 2019 Ganief Hendricks, leader a Muslim political party in South Africa, Al Jama'ah, used one of the replicas to be sworn in as member of parliament. 
Little did the Dutch realise that by banishing Tuan Guru to southern Africa they would inadvertently be the catalyst for spreading Islam to this part of the world, where Muslims now make up around 5% of Cape Town's estimated population of 4.6 million. 
""When he came to the Cape, Tuan Guru observed that Islam was in pretty bad shape so he had a lot of work to do,"" Mr Morton says.
""The community didn't really have their hands on any texts - they were Muslims more from cultural memory than anything else. 
""I would say that that first Quran he wrote is the reason why the Muslim community survived and developed into the respected community we have today.""

Harold: Second US tropical storm in a week drenches Texas,"Tropical Storm Harold made landfall on the south-east coast of Texas on Tuesday, bringing more heavy rain and high winds to the southern US.
The storm has dumped up to 7in (17.7cm) of rain in some parts of the state. 
By late Tuesday afternoon, the storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression, but heavy rains continued.
More than 23,000 people were without power in the Lone Star state on Tuesday night. 
The Texas deluge arrived a day after historic amounts of rain flooded parts of the south-western US.
California and Nevada were cleaning up on Tuesday after seeing historic amounts of rain from Storm Hilary, which caused widespread flooding. 
Tropical Storm Harold made landfall on Tuesday morning local time on Texas' Padre Island in the Gulf of Mexico.
Tropical storm warnings had been issued from the Rio Grande river - along the state's southern boundary - to roughly 250 miles (400km) north, to the community of Port O'Connor. 
Scattered instances of flash flooding were still a threat, the NWS warned.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the state had deployed emergency resources including rescue boats, search-and-rescue teams and platoons from the state National Guard.
Wind gusts of 59 mph were reported outside of Corpus Christi. 
The storm was expected to continue to carry rain, wind and hail farther inland as it tracks westward across the hot and dry Texas landscape.
Rain was expected to taper off on Wednesday. 
As Texans endure the deluge, weather officials have warned of yet another tropical storm - Franklin - currently some 230 miles east off the coast of the Dominican Republican.
Up to 6in of rain from Franklin is predicted to fall in Puerto Rico from Wednesday.
The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but we know that increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above and make more energy available to drive hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons. As a result, they are likely to be more intense with more extreme rainfall.
The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

How esports helped a snooker player go pro,"Going from the the top of the esports world to the elite tier of pro snooker might not seem like the easiest career move. 
But Ishpreet Singh Chadha isn't afraid to challenge himself.
The 27-year-old from India had always wanted to be a top snooker player. But a leg injury in 2017 left him unable to compete.
So he turned back to his other great love - video games.
He started playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a massively popular team-based first-person shooter. 
""I got really good,"" Ishpreet tells BBC Asian Network. ""I was the best player in my country for two years.""
He signed a contract with Entity eSports - which describes itself as India's number one competitive gaming organisation.
Counter-Strike is regularly played in worldwide competitions that attract large audiences, and it gave Ishpreet a taste of what it's like to play in front of spectators.
""We had at least 400 to 500 people watching us live,"" he says. ""Thousands on the internet as well, a lot of screaming and hype when you're playing. 
""The adrenaline... it was totally different. I loved it.""
But when Covid struck and his contract with Entity ended, Ishpreet went back to snooker again. 
He thought the pandemic would have interrupted practice for many players, and saw a chance to build up his own skills.
""I thought everybody would be on a similar level again because nobody touched a cue,"" he says.
""So I thought that was my chance to get better than them, work harder than before.""
It paid off. 
Ishpreet won the Indian national championships last year and is playing in the European Masters - the first main event of the season - in Germany this week.
It's the biggest tournament he's played in so far and says his experience of gaming played a big part.
""I can handle pressure much better,"" he says. 
""When we played Counter-Strike, we used to play for the team first, and then for yourself.
""You can't let four other people down. You also play in front of big crowds, so I think I can handle pressure a little bit better and my temperament has improved too. 
""Gaming helped me a lot in life.""
After his success back home, Ishpreet decided to move to the UK - a country he'd never visited - to join the pro snooker tour this year.
He's based in Sheffield - home of World Championships venue The Crucible - and is one of only two Indian players on the circuit. 
And he says living in the sport's spiritual home has boosted his game.
""People actually respect snooker in the UK,"" he says. ""It's not considered a proper sport in India, like cricket is. Not many people actually know what snooker is.""
And it's allowed him to experience a different kind of pressure.
""I'm leaving myself with no choice but to play snooker,"" he says. 
""Not having a backup is something people should try at least once in their life. When your back's against the wall it's a time where you can learn so much about yourself.""
Ishpreet might be good at adapting to new challenges and dealing with new pressures, but he does admit there's another secret to his success - his mum Bobby.
He says she's the most important person in his life.
""My mum's a single parent,"" he says.
""Since I was 10, it was only me and her. She's never forced me to do anything, but always said whatever you do, you should do it with full passion and give it your best shot.""
The two are so close that she's moved to the UK with him.
""She sacrificed a lot for me to be here,"" says Ishpreet.
""We've gone through a lot so nothing can shake my mind at the moment because I'm in a very happy place right now. 
""You know, with this opportunity, I'll either win or I'll learn. There's no losing.""

Grant Shapps visits Kyiv as UK backs Ukraine nuclear power,"UK support will help power Ukraine's nuclear plants, Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps has said after visiting the country. 
The government has announced it will provide a £192m loan guarantee to enable a UK-based company to supply Ukraine with uranium enrichment services, a vital part of nuclear fuel.
Nuclear power generates more than half of Ukraine's electricity. 
But its largest plant, at Zaporizhzhia, is currently held by Russia. 
While he was in Ukraine on Tuesday, Mr Shapps visited a power station, which has been badly damaged by Russian bombing. 
He also met senior Ukrainian ministers and energy industry figures in Kyiv to discuss the UK's support for the country's recovery.  
The government has said it will provide the loan guarantee through UK Export Finance - the UK's export credit agency - to enable UK-headquartered company Urenco to supply Ukraine's national nuclear company,  Energoatom. 
The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said this would bring the total of the UK's non-military assistance to Ukraine to nearly £5bn.
It said the support would strengthen Ukraine's energy security as it defends itself against the Russian invasion, as well as maintain its independence from Russian nuclear fuel.
Ukraine has four nuclear power plants - including Europe's largest at Zaporizhzhia - but before the Russian invasion in February 2022 it had been receiving most of its nuclear services and fuel from Russia. 
It has been reducing its dependence and in June last year signed a deal with US company Westinghouse to supply fuel to all its nuclear power stations. 
Mr Shapps said: ""Our support for Ukraine is unwavering in the face of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's barbaric invasion - the UK continues to stand with Ukraine as they repel Russian attacks and rebuild their country.""
He added: ""Putin has used energy as a weapon of war: the action today to support nuclear fuel deliveries will help Ukraine end their reliance on Russian supplies and bolster their energy security."" 
The UK announcement comes after a meeting of G7 energy ministers in Japan earlier this year, where the UK, US, Canada, Japan and France agreed a new nuclear fuel alliance in an attempt to strengthen the sector in each country and push Russia out of the market. 
Other European countries have also offered financial support to Ukraine's energy sector through the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, which aims to repair damage caused by Russia to infrastructure and keep it running. 
Last year, Mr Shapps took in a Ukrainian family as part of the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme. 
While in Ukraine, Mr Shapps visited a kindergarten, which was damaged by Russian shelling and was previously attended by Nikita, the young son of the family who lived with him. 
The children performed a song before Mr Shapps played them a recorded message from Nikita.

Dispute over timing of triathlon safety warnings,"Brendan Wall (l) and Ivan Chittenden (r) died in separate events during the Ironman event in Youghal, County Cork
At a glance
Tributes have been paid to the two men who died during a triathlon event over the weekend
Ivan Chittenden and Brendan Wall got into difficulty during the swim element of the event
Mr Wall's death was described as ""devastating"" by his employer
A coach for Mr Chittenden said the Toronto man died doing what he loved
Triathlon Ireland has rejected any suggestion that it only refused to sanction the Ironman event in County Cork at the weekend after the race had started.
Two men died during the swim stage of the endurance event and some participants have since said they felt the sea conditions on Sunday were too rough.
A spokesperson for Triathlon Ireland, the governing body for triathlons on the island, said the organisation raised concerns before the race began.
Earlier on Tuesday, event organiser Ironman Ireland issued a statement outlining its version of events.
A spokesperson said it worked in collaboration with national federations across the world.
It said that ""several hours after the swim was completed"" representatives from Triathlon Ireland said they would not sanction the event.
Ironmen Ireland have disputed claims made by Triathlon Ireland in regards to their sanctioning of the event
When asked about the statement, within an hour, Triathlon Ireland responded.
A spokesperson said its officials had attended before the start of the race to review the conditions and assess the safety of the water.
“Due to adverse conditions on the day, before the start of the race Triathlon Ireland technical officials confirmed to the race organisers that it was not possible to sanction the race,"" the spokesperson said.
Ironman made it clear in its statement that safety checks had been carried out before the race, and the water had passed its tests.
“On the morning of Sunday 20 August, Ironman Ireland officials and the specific on-swim safety team carried out all standard safety protocol checks that are completed at every race and determined water conditions were safe for the swim to take place,"" a spokesperson said.
“While conditions were improved from Saturday, out of an abundance of safety, it was decided to shorten the swim course for both races.“
Ironman said its thoughts “continue to be with the family and friends of the two athletes who passed”.
Both men got into difficulty in the swim element of the half Ironman triathlon event at Claycastle beach
Ivan Chittenden, 64, was one of two men who died in separate incidents during the swim element of the event in Youghal.
His coach said he died doing what he loved.
Brendan Wall, 45, who also died, was praised by his employer as a ""key member of the team"".
Mr Chittenden, who was from Toronoto in Canada, and Mr Wall, who was originally from County Meath, got into difficulty at Claycastle beach on Sunday morning.
Mr Wall had got engaged to his fiancée, Tina, earlier this year, Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported.
In May, he began work as a sales director at Top Tubes in Wednesbury in England's West Midlands.
Managing director of Top Tubes, April Pearson Myatt, described Mr Wall's death as devastating news.
""Brendan was a key member of the team and will be sadly missed both at a personal and professional level,"" she said.
She also extended her condolences to Mr Wall's family, and said the news had been met with a heavy heart at the company.
Mr Wall had previously been employed by Cavan-based cutting tools manufacturer ATA Group and Elements Material Technology in London.
His funeral is due to take place in Church of St Brigid, Grangegeeth in Slane on Thursday.
Mr Chittenden worked as a senior partner in EY (Ernst and Young)  before his retirement two years ago. 
He first began working for the firm as a student in May 1979.
Mr Chittenden, who was married with a family, was also a keen triathlete and had taken part in Ironman events before.
Ironman trainer Lisa Bentley who coached Mr Chittenden for 12 years told RTÉ he died ""doing what he loved"".
""He was my friend. He was my family. Those are not words. That is a fact. I will miss him very much,"" she said.
""I know in my heart that he was doing what he loved when he left us. Ivan was in the shape of his life. He kept getting faster as he got older.""
She said he had competed in all of the major marathons worldwide, including Tokyo, Berlin, Chicago, New York, London and Boston.
A spokesperson for the Irish Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media described the deaths as a terrible tragedy.
Irish Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien said serious issues needed to be addressed after the two men's deaths.
He added that all stakeholders involved needed to be ""very forthright"" in what happened and what safety measures ""were, or indeed were not put in place"".

Caleb Farley: NFL player’s father killed in home explosion,"The father of NFL star Caleb Farley was killed in a massive explosion early on Tuesday at the player's North Carolina home, officials said.
First responders found the body of Robert Farley, 61, after searching through the debris of the multimillion-dollar house.
The Tennessee Titans cornerback was not at home at the time of the explosion.
The investigation is focusing on the property's natural gas lines - no foul play is suspected. 
Christian Rogers, 25, a family friend who was also at the home, was taken to hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, according to a statement released by Iredell County.
The 6,300 sq ft (585 sq m) lakeside property, in the Charlotte suburb of Mooresville, was reduced to rubble and all vehicles parked outside the home were destroyed. 
""There's a lot of devastation,"" Iredell County director of fire services and emergency management Kent Greene told the Tennessean. ""There's nothing left of this structure except a partial wall.""
Mr Farley, 24, was spotted on the scene speaking to authorities after the blast on Tuesday morning.
Neighbours told local news outlet Queen City News that they had smelled gas and heard the explosion. 
""A loud boom, about five minutes to midnight,"" said neighbour Clay Wild. ""I can't believe it.""
Caleb Farley grew up in nearby Maiden, North Carolina, before going to play American football at Virginia Tech. He was later the number 22 overall pick in the 2021 draft. 
Titans coach Mike Vrabel gathered the players after practice on Tuesday and they kneeled to pray for Mr Farley. 
""What's most important is that we do everything we can to support him emotionally,"" Mr Vrabel said. ""It's shocking. We've got to focus on Caleb and his family, and how we can support him.""
In 2018, Mr Farley lost his mother to breast cancer, Sports Illustrated reported.
""I know he lost his mother at a young age as well,"" his teammate Kevin Byard said. 
""He's dealt with a lot of adversity. It's very tragic. It's an unimaginable tragedy.""

French airport to be renamed after Queen Elizabeth II in tribute,"An airport in France will be renamed in honour of Queen Elizabeth II after receiving permission from the King, officials in the town have said. 
Le Touquet, in northern France, received the blessing from the King on Monday, its town hall said.
Touquet-Paris-Plage airport will be Elizabeth II Le Touquet-Paris-Plage International Airport.
The town hall said the tribute to the ""Great Queen"" would also recognise the ""most British of French resorts"". 
A date for the inauguration has not been set. 
It comes after the original proposal was made to the British Crown six days after the death of the Queen on 8 September last year. 
Le Touquet explained it was also a nod to the late Queen's uncle, Edward VIII, who visited the resort to enjoy horse riding and sand yachting, sometimes accompanied by his niece when she was not yet Queen. 
""That King Charles III accepted the proposal of the mayor of Le Touquet further reinforces the strategy of the latter who wants to affirm Le Touquet as 'the most British of French resorts',"" Le Touquet's town hall added. 
The airport was designed in the 1930s to welcome Britons to the coastal town about an hour's drive from Calais. President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte also have a holiday home there. 
The town hopes its airport's new name will strengthen the link between the town and the UK, and welcome tourist planes from across the Channel. 
Next month, Le Touquet will host the England rugby team when it plays in Rugby World Cup being hosted in France. 
Buckingham Palace and the Cabinet Office have been contacted for comment on the renaming.

Zimbabwe elections 2023: What you need to know,"Zimbabwe heads to the polls in August against a backdrop of one of the world's highest rates of inflation and accusations of an intensifying crackdown on the opposition. 
Long-time president Robert Mugabe was deposed in 2017 but many say that little has changed. 
In the run-up to the vote, questions linger over how free and fair the ballot will be in a country that is trying to rehabilitate its image.
Zimbabweans will vote on 23 August to elect councillors, members of parliament, and a president. If there is no outright winner in the presidential contest, a run-off will be held six weeks later, on 2 October.
The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission has approved 11 candidates.
This is sharply down on the 23 who contested the last election, in 2018, no doubt because each candidate now has to pay $20,000 (£16,000), up from $1,000 (£800).
But the contest is likely to be between two men:
Mr Mnangagwa, 80, has led Zimbabwe since the military forced Robert Mugabe to resign in 2017, and then won a disputed election a year later. He was a long-time ally of Mugabe before the pair fell out.
Mr Chamisa, 45, came second in 2018, winning 44% of the vote. A 2020 court ruling stripped him of the leadership of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and he subsequently lost access to party assets and state funding. 
He formed the CCC in 2022, remains hugely popular in urban areas and is the main face of the opposition. 
Other contenders include Elisabeth Valerio, the only female candidate. She had been disqualified but successfully challenged the decision by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) to reject her nomination papers.
Douglas Mwonzora, the MDC's new leader, is on the presidential ballot, although he asked Zec to remove his name, saying the election is a ""sham"". 
The other candidates are:
Zanu-PF has the advantage of incumbency, state power and access to state resources. The party, which has been in power since independence in 1980, also retains strong support in rural areas.
However with the economy in such a mess, many people, especially those in urban areas and the youth, think it is time for a change. 
Rural voters normally turn out in huge numbers, unlike urban and youth voters, which could work against the opposition. The government has also refused to allow Zimbabweans living abroad to vote - which could also work against Mr Chamisa. 
Polling so far has predicted different results, so it is hard to use that as a guide as to who may end up president.
Furthermore, human rights activists say that in the past Zanu-PF has used various tactics to stay in power, including violence and intimidation, state-media blackouts and negative coverage of the opposition. Zanu-PF has previously denied using dirty tricks against its opponents.
The cost-of-living crisis continues to be at the core of voters' concerns, with the last three years having been some of the worst in a decade. In the 12 months leading up to May this year, prices rose by 86.5%, one of the highest annual inflation rates in the world. 
Meanwhile, businesses are struggling to cope with crippling power outages and an unstable local currency, which lost 86% of its value between January and early June. 
Allegations of corruption also remain a source of frustration, with a very low rate of prosecution. During the Covid pandemic, equipment was allegedly procured at inflated prices - the health minister was fired but then exonerated by the courts. 
For members of parliament and council candidates, the election is won on a first-past-the-post basis - in other words the person who has the most votes. 
In the presidential race, however, a candidate needs more than 50% of the vote to be declared the winner, otherwise there will be a run-off election between the top two.  
By law the presidential election results must be announced within five days after voting ends.  
Civil society groups and the opposition doubt that polls will be free or fair. They cite what they say has been a systemic crackdown on government critics. 
The arrests and convictions of opposition figures and government critics has intensified over the last two years. 
The electoral reforms that the opposition have demanded for years - to level the playing field, provide access to public media and remove ex-military personnel from the electoral body - have not happened. 
CCC leader Mr Chamisa says more than 60 of the party's meetings were banned, or disrupted by police during by-elections last year, prompting fears it will happen again. 
As former Zimbabwean politician Jonathan Moyo put it, Zanu-PF will not ""reform itself out of power"".
This will be the second time Mr Mnangagwa and Mr Chamisa face each other. 
Five years ago, the president won in the first round with 50.8% of the vote, but violence followed polling day in which six people were killed when security forces opened fire on protesters. 
Observers generally commended the freedom of movement during the campaign period and relative peace on voting day, but the EU for example noted major shortcomings including state resources being misused in favour of the incumbent. 
The EU said the final results as announced by the Electoral Commission contained numerous errors. 
Mr Chamisa's party failed in its legal challenge to have the result overturned after arguing that the presidential and parliamentary vote tallies were off by tens of thousands.

Sara Sharif murder inquiry: Surrey Police had contact with family of girl found dead,"Police have had ""historic"" contact with the family of a 10-year-old girl who was found dead at her home, a senior officer has said.
Det Supt Mark Chapman of Surrey Police said the interaction with Sara Sharif's family ""goes back some years"".
It follows Surrey County Council's disclosure that the family, from Woking, were known to the authorities. 
Three family members went to Pakistan before Sara's body was found on 10 August and are wanted by the police.
Det Supt Chapman told the BBC: ""Surrey Police's contact with the family has been on a limited basis. It's been on a historic basis. And that goes back some time.""
He said police interaction with the Sharif family ""goes back some years"" but declined to expand on his comment.
The police officer also said the force had not referred the case to the police watchdog, adding: ""Surrey Police have reviewed the position and it doesn't fulfil the criteria to alert the Independent Office for Police Conduct.""
The three people who travelled to Pakistan, and are now thought to be in Islamabad, are Sara's father, Urfan Sharif, 41, his partner, Beinash Batool, 29, and his brother, Faisal Malik, 28.
Police in Pakistan confirmed to the BBC that they had questioned - but not arrested - two of Mr Sharif's brothers as well as his father. The brothers - Imran Sharif and Zareef Sharif - are both based there.The police also revealed that they are under pressure from the Federal Investigation Agency in Pakistan to find the trio who left England.
Det Supt Chapman said Surrey officers wanted to build a picture of how Sara - a Year 5 pupil at St Mary's C of E primary school in Byfleet - had lived.
He said: ""We're looking to hear from anybody who lived in the area who regularly saw Sara going about her daily routine.
""Any parents who may know of Sara from school or other regular activities. Any parties that might have gone on out of school, or anyone who had any form of contact with her really, no matter how insignificant it might seem.""
After it was revealed Sara was known to the authorities, campaigner on children's social care, Chris Wild, who advised the government's most recent review into children's social care, told the BBC's World at One programme this meant Sara would have been ""on their radar"".
He also said there may have been a child protection order in place, or a safeguarding concern made.
The council has said a multi-agency review is under way.
Police have said Mr Sharif, 41, made a 999 call from Pakistan shortly after landing in Islamabad with his partner, his brother and five children, aged between one and 13.
That led officers to the house in Woking where they found Sara's body. She had sustained ""multiple and extensive injuries"" likely to have been caused over a sustained period of time.
Police have also been searching the family's previous address in West Byfleet.
There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Pakistan.
This article has been updated to clarify the nature of the family's previous contact with the police.

Pakistan cable car: Relief as all passengers brought to safety,"This video can not be played
Watch: The moment two children were brought to safety along a zip line
All eight people who were stuck in a cable car dangling hundreds of metres above a ravine in Pakistan's north-west for many hours have now been rescued. 
In a slow and dangerous operation, a military helicopter rescued one child, while teams on the ground recovered the rest of the group after dark.
They were helped to safety along a zip line, with a huge crowd on top of the hillside celebrating their rescue.
The group were on their way to school when one of the car's cables snapped.
It was left hanging precariously across 274m (900ft) above the ground and in high winds.
Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, Anwaar ul Haq Kakar, said he was relieved, and thanked all of those who were involved in the rescue.
Pakistan's army said the rescue mission had been ""extremely difficult and dangerous"".
The incident happened at about 07:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Tuesday near the city of Battagram in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. 
Six children, aged between 10 and 16 years old, were trapped, along with two adults. 
One of the children, a teenage boy, has a heart condition and was unconscious for several hours, an adult on board named Gulfaraz told local media.
A child also fainted due to ""heat and fear"", a rescue worker told Reuters news agency, although it was unclear if that was the same child.
Known by locals as ""Dolly"", the cable car links the village of Jangri to Batangi, where the school is located.
The car is a popular and cheap mode of transport to get across the Allai valley - cutting a two-hour road journey through mountainous terrain to just four minutes.
When the cable suddenly snapped, Dolly was making its fifth trip of the day.
Residents used loudspeakers to alert officials to the crisis, but it took at least four hours for the first rescue helicopter to arrive at the remote location, local media outlet Dawn reported. 
Anxious crowds, including relatives of those trapped, quickly gathered along the ravine, watching on as military helicopters battled against the strong winds to lower commandos to the stranded car. 
Several early attempts to reach them failed, however some food and water was successfully delivered.
In addition to gusty winds, there were concerns that the helicopter's rotor blades could further destabilise the cable car, and as night set in the operation was suspended.
But rescuers continued their efforts with the help of zip line experts and local people on the ground.
Allai is a mountainous area, located at an altitude of 2000m above sea level. Settlements are spread far and wide and there is little infrastructure like roads and basic facilities. 
In most of the area, makeshift chairlifts and cable cars are used regularly for transportation from one mountain to another.
The one involved in this incident is believed to be privately operated by residents, local media reported.
Police said they checked the lift every month, however BBC News has been unable to independently verify this.
Anwaar ul Haq Kakar says he has ordered all privately-operated lifts to be inspected for safety.
Additional reporting from Zubair Khan, in Abbottabad, and Kelly Ng in Singapore.

Magaluf: Men suspected of gang-raping British teen were not all friends,"Eight men suspected of gang-raping an 18-year-old British woman in Majorca were not all known to each other, Spanish police have said.
Five French and one Swiss tourist were arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and violation of the right to privacy earlier this month.
Two more men, both residents in France, were arrested in that country this week and are awaiting extradition.
The alleged attack is said to have taken place in the resort of Magaluf.
""Of the eight [suspects], some knew each other, they weren't all strangers,"" said a spokesman for the civil guard. ""But it was not one group of friends.""
The alleged victim is thought to have met a group of young tourists in the early hours of 14 August. 
She is believed to have followed them to their hotel, where she was forced to have sexual intercourse and was filmed by the alleged aggressors.
The woman later escaped and was helped by hotel staff after being found in the street. 
She was taken to Son Espases hospital in Palma de Mallorca, where she was treated before registering her rape complaint.
Police arrested the first six suspects within hours of the alleged attack and they are in preventive custody.
The pair arrested this week flew from Spain to Baden-Baden in Germany, then travelled to France.
A Spanish judge issued a European detention order and one of them was held in Scherwiller and the other at the airport of Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg, both in the north-eastern Alsace region, the civil guard reported.
With the two arrests in France, the Spanish civil guard said it has closed its investigation into this case.
The force said that ""the swift and efficient action of this team"" in tandem with local police ""has permitted the arrest of all those responsible for this brutal attack"".

Mexico bus crash: 15 migrants killed as bus collides with trailer,"At least 15 migrants are dead and 36 others injured after a bus crash in central Mexico, local authorities said.
The migrants, mostly from Venezuela, were traveling in the state of Puebla when the crash took place early on Tuesday morning. 
Local authorities believe the bus struck a trailer while on a highway. 
Migrants are often transported by bus from Mexico's southern border with Guatemala as they head north to the US. 
Puebla's state government confirmed the crash on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. 
Images shared on X by Mexico's National Guard show officers near two severely damaged vehicles at a steep curve on the highway in a hilly and mountainous area. 
According to Mexican media outlets, the highway is frequently used by human smugglers. 
Salomón Jara, the governor of the nearby state of Oaxaca - from where the migrants were believed to be traveling - said he had instructed authorities to provide support to the injured.
""We're sending a hug and our condolences to the families of those who perished, to whom we will also offer all our support,"" Mr Jara said. 
The injured, which include both men and women, were transported to three hospitals in the city of Tehuacán. 
Hundreds of thousands of migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America try to cross through Mexico each year in a bid to reach the US.
Many of them pay smugglers, who illegally transport them in crowded and dangerous trucks on the long journey, and road accidents are common.
In July, for example, at least 29 people were killed when a bus fell into a ravine in Oaxaca. 
In a separate incident in February, 17 migrants from Colombia and Venezuela were killed in an accident in Puebla. 
In 2021, 56 migrants were killed when an overloaded vehicle carrying 160 people overturned on a highway in the city of Tuxtla Gutierrez in the southern state of Chiapas. The victims were primarily from Guatemala.

'Chinese activist Kwon Pyong' fled to South Korea on jet ski,"A man believed to be a Chinese rights activist has been arrested in South Korea after an apparent attempt to flee there on a jet ski.
The country's coast guard said the man had travelled about 300km (186 miles) across the Yellow Sea using binoculars and a compass, but then got stuck.
Local reports named him as Kwon Pyong, a critic of President Xi Jinping, but his identity has not been verified.
The Chinese embassy in Seoul declined to comment.
In recent years, Beijing has increased its use of exit bans at airports and other legal border crossings in order to block activists from leaving Chinese territory. 
Many pro-Beijing countries in south-east Asia will no longer harbour asylum seekers, adding to the difficulties faced by dissidents hoping to flee.
Last month, the noted Chinese human rights lawyer Lu Siwei was captured in Laos before he was able to join his wife and children in the United States. There are concerns he will be returned to China and will face prosecution. 
But jet skiing across choppy waters to South Korea is perhaps one of the more extreme escape attempts seen in modern times.
South Korea's coast guard said the man, wearing a life jacket and helmet, was towing five barrels of fuel from Shandong province behind the 1800cc machine. 
""He refilled the petrol on the ride and dumped the empty barrels into the sea,"" it explained, adding that he got into trouble near a cruise terminal off the western port of Incheon and called for help.
The coast guard did not identify the man, but said he was detained last Wednesday for attempting ""to smuggle himself"" into the city. There is no suspicion that he could be a spy. South Korea-based campaigner Lee Dae-seon, from non-profit organisation Dialogue China, told the AFP news agency on Tuesday that Mr Kwon, 35, was the escapee.
Mr Kwon has spent time in prison in China for publicly criticising President Xi.
It is highly likely that he would have experienced problems trying to leave the country by regular travel routes in order to claim asylum, and he is likely to have been subject to an exit ban stopping him from departing China legally.
Mr Lee said: ""While [Mr Kwon's] means of entry into South Korea in violation of the law was wrong, surveillance of the Chinese authorities and political persecution of Kwon since 2016 are behind his life-risking crossing into South Korea.""
He added that Mr Kwon was now considering whether to apply for refugee status in South Korea - which only grants a handful of requests each year - or a third country.

Greece wildfires: Eighteen bodies found in Greek forest,"Eighteen bodies have been found in a forested area of northern Greece hit by wildfires for the past four days, the Greek fire service says.
Initial reports suggest those who died may have been migrants. A coroner and investigation team are heading to the scene near the Dadia forest.
The Evros region of north-eastern Greece, not far from the Turkish border, has been ravaged by fires.
A hospital in the city of Alexandroupolis had to be evacuated.
Newborn babies and intensive care patients were among those moved to a ferry at the port.
Fires are raging across several fronts in Greece, whipped up by high winds and temperatures which climbed above 40C in several places on Tuesday.
Flames are thought to have spread rapidly since Monday in the large wooded Dadia national park to the north of Alexandroupolis. Emergency services sent mobile text messages to the surrounding areas asking people to leave.
Before the latest grim discovery, an initial death believed to have been of a migrant was reported in the area. 
Eighteen more bodies were found on Tuesday near a hut outside the village of Avantas, reports said, when the fire brigade inspected the charred remains of a building. 
Fire service spokesman Yiannis Artopios said the possibility that the victims had entered Greece illegally was being investigated, given that there had been no reports of missing residents.
Unconfirmed reports said the bodies were discovered in two groups and there were fears that the number of casualties could increase. The fire service said investigations were continuing throughout the area where the fire had spread.
The Evros region has become one of the most popular routes for Syrian and Asian migrants crossing the River Evros from Turkey into the European Union. The Dadia forest is also known to be a route favoured by migrants.
Yiannis Artopios stressed that emergency messages had been sent to all mobile phones in the area, including foreign networks.
Migrant support group Alarm Phone said it had been in contact with more migrants who needed rescuing from the fires. One group of nine people had already crossed the border while another 250 people were stranded on two small islands in the River Evros, it said.
In the past three days 380,000 acres of land has burned in the Evros region alone, according to the National Observatory of Athens' Meteo unit.
Firefighters are having to respond to major outbreaks in other parts of Greece too. The fire brigade has urged tens of thousands of people to leave parts of the north-west Athens suburb of Ano Liosia. 
A few kilometres to the north, 50 nuns were reported trapped when a fire broke out near a historic monastery on the slopes of Mt Parnitha.
Several villages have also been evacuated on the island of Evia and in Boeotia in central Greece.
A fiery, red glow was visible on the fringe of Alexandroupolis in the early hours of Tuesday and satellite images showed several regions of Greece covered in thick smoke.
During the night residents in eight nearby villages were told to leave their homes and head for safety in the city. Later on Tuesday a stream of cars could be seen heading there as vegetation along the coast burned.
Flames were seen entering the grounds of the university hospital while the operation was taking place to evacuate the site on the north-east fringe of Alexandroupolis. Greek officials ordered a fleet of ambulances and buses to take some 115 patients away.
While some of the patients were moved to other hospitals in the city, as many as 90 were taken to a ferry, the Adamantios Korais, which has been requisitioned to look after intensive care patients and new-born babies.
West of Athens, several warehouses became engulfed in flames in an industrial area in Aspropyrgos and close to the Attica Highway the sky darkened with acrid smoke.
Two Albanian workers told the BBC that if helicopters had arrived in time they would have been able to put the fire out. 
Around midday on Tuesday a second large fire broke out on the opposite side of the highway in the village of Fyli. Half an hour later residents received a mobile phone message from the 112 emergency number to evacuate the area.
Meanwhile, France endured its hottest ever day on Monday after the mid-August holiday, according to weather service Météo-France.
Temperatures on Monday soared as high as 42.4C in the Drôme area of south-eastern France but the record refers to Monday's daily average temperature of 26.63C, recorded in 30 weather stations across France.
In Switzerland, the high temperatures have pushed the ""zero-degree isotherm"" - the height where temperatures fall below freezing point - to a record altitude. MeteoSwiss said the limit had now increased to 5,298m (17,381ft).
The point is shifting steadily higher, mainly because of global warming induced by humans, the Swiss met office says. 
The increased height of the zero-degree isotherm has been accelerating since the 1970s, especially in spring and summer, it says.

New Zealand country profile,"New Zealand is a wealthy Pacific nation dominated by two cultural groups - New Zealanders of European descent, and the Maori, who are descendants of Polynesian settlers.
It is made up of two main islands and numerous smaller ones. Around three-quarters of the population lives on the North Island, which is also home to the capital, Wellington. 
Agriculture is the economic mainstay, but manufacturing and tourism are important. Visitors are drawn to the glacier-carved mountains, lakes, beaches and thermal springs. Because of the islands' geographical isolation, much of the flora and fauna is unique to the country.
New Zealand plays an active role in Pacific affairs, and has special constitutional ties with the Pacific territories of Niue, the Cook Islands and Tokelau.
Head of state: Charles III, represented by a governor-general
Prime minister: Chris Hipkins
Chris Hipkins became prime minister in January 2023 following the unexpected resignation of his Labour Party predecessor Jacinda Ardern, who had won second term in October 2020 - Ardern had said she no longer had ""enough in the tank"" to lead the country.
Jacinda Arden had won praise at home and abroad for her handling of two major crises - the 2019 Christchurch mosque shooting, and the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. 
Mr Hipkins now faces the uphill task of retaining power in the upcoming general elections in October. Opinion polls have suggested that his party is trailing its conservative opposition, the National Party, in popularity.
The country was among the first to close borders, this won plaudits for keeping New Zealand virus-free early in the pandemic, but frustration set in later when people tired of the zero-tolerance strategy, which saw nationwide lockdowns over a single infection.
Broadcasters enjoy one of the world's most liberal media arenas.

"Armed gardaí, dog units and checkpoints to tackle Dublin crime","The extra funding comes after high-profile attacks in Dublin city centre over the summer
At a glance
A funding package for increased Irish police visibility in Dublin city centre has come into effect
Specialist units, including armed response, are to be deployed in the city centre
The €10m (£8.5m) overtime payment was announced by the Irish Justice Minister last month
It comes after a string of assaults in the city
The money allows for more than 16,500 hours of police overtime
Additional armed gardaí (Irish police) and specialist units are to be deployed in Dublin as part of a €10m (£8.5m) overtime payment from the Irish government for additional policing in the city centre.
It comes after a string of serious attacks in the Irish capital, including an assault which left an American tourist in a coma last month.
The funding will allow for more than 16,500 additional policing hours each month, gardaí have said.
There will also be an enhanced garda presence at strategic locations in the city, such as main thoroughfares and the Liffey Boardwalk.
Specialist units will be deployed in the city centre to enhance police visibility
The money is part of a package announced in July by Justice Minister Helen McEntee to increase gardaí visibility in the city.
The focus of Operation Citizen will be on tackling street-level drug dealing, anti-social behaviour and the seizure of alcohol.
About 20% of the funding will be put towards providing additional public order capacity on a daily basis.
As well as uniformed gardaí, specialist units such as the Garda Air Support Unit, the Garda Mounted Unit, the Garda Dog Unit, Regional Armed Response Units, and Road Policing Units will be deployed to enhance police visibility.
There will also be planned ""days of high impact visibility"" involving checkpoints, execution of warrants, intelligence-led arrests and immigration checks.
Assistant CommissionerAngela Willis said an enhanced visible garda presence was central to the operation.
""The overall objective of our activity is to reassure the citizens, visitors and the business community that Dublin is a safe place in which to live, visit, and work,"" she said.
On Monday, Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Jim O'Callaghan described parts of the city as unsafe after a man was attacked on one of Dublin's busiest streets over the weekend.
The man in his 30s was taken to St James' Hospital for non-life threatening injuries after he was stabbed on Grafton Street on Sunday.

Tuvalu country profile,"Tuvalu is a group of nine tiny islands in the South Pacific which won independence from the United Kingdom in 1978. 
Five of the islands are coral atolls, the other four consist of land rising from the sea bed.
Formerly known as the Ellice Islands, all are low-lying, with no point on Tuvalu being higher than 4.5m above sea level. Local politicians have campaigned against climate change, arguing that it could see the islands swamped by rising sea levels.
Life on the islands is simple and often harsh. There are no streams or rivers, so the collection of rain is essential.
Coconut palms cover most of the islands, and copra - dried coconut kernel - is practically the only export commodity. Increasing salination of the soil threatens traditional subsistence farming.
Tuvalu has shown ingenuity by exploiting another source of income. It has sold its internet suffix - .tv - to a Californian company for several million dollars a year in continuing revenue. The company sells the suffix on to television broadcasters.
Head of state: King Charles III, represented by a governor-general
Prime Minister: Kausea Natano
Kausea Natano was appointed prime minister following the September 2019 general elections. He succeeded Enele Sosene Sopoaga, who became prime minster in 2013 after Willy Telavi was dismissed by the governor-general for his failure to convene parliament for eight months. 
He was first elected an MP in 2002, and served as the country's deputy prime minister and minister for communications in former prime minister Willy Telavi's cabinet.
Tuvalu has no political parties. Allegiances revolve around personalities and geography. The 15-member parliament is popularly elected every four years. The prime minister is chosen by MPs.
Media freedom is respected in Tuvalu but the market is very small. The government operates Radio Tuvalu. Many islanders use satellite dishes to watch foreign TV stations. 
Some key dates in Tuvalu's history:
14th century AD - Samoans, Tongans and settlers from other Polynesian islands migrate to the islands
1568 and 1595 - Spaniard Alvaro Mendana de Neyra sights the islands of Nui and Niulakita on two separate expeditions.
1819 - A ship owned by British MP Edward Ellice visits Funafuta. The captain names the island Ellice Island. Later this name was applied to all nine atolls.
1850-75 - ""Blackbirding"" - the kidnapping of islanders for forced labour on plantations in Fiji and Queensland - and the introduction of European diseases reduces the population from 20,000 to 3,000. In 1863 Peruvian slave traders kidnap 400 islanders - nearly two-thirds of the population of the islands of Funafuti and Nukulaelae.
1877 - Britain sets up the Western Pacific High Commission with its headquarters in Fiji. The Ellice Islands and other island groups come under its jurisdiction. 
1892 - Britain declares a joint protectorate over the Ellice Islands and the Gilbert Islands.
1916 -The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony is formed. Over the next 20 years other island groups, including the Line Islands and the Phoenix Islands, join the colony. 
1974 - Ethnic tensions result in more than 90% of the mainly Polynesian Ellice Islanders voting for separation from the predominantly Micronesian Gilbert Islands. 
1975 - Ellice Islands become a separate British dependency, under the pre-colonial name of Tuvalu meaning ""eight standing together"" which refers to the eight populated atolls.
1978 - Independence.
1986 - Votes to remain an independent constitutional monarchy with the British monarch at its head. 
1989 - UN lists Tuvalu as one of a number of island groups most likely to disappear beneath the sea in the 21st Century because of global warming.
2000 - Admitted to the United Nations. 
2001 - New Zealand offers to resettle islanders threatened by rising sea-levels. Tuvalu says it will take legal action, along with Kiribati and the Maldives, against the US for its refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
2008 - Votes again to remain an independent constitutional monarchy with the British monarch at its head, though the referendum turnout is low - 21%. 
2022 - Amid rivalry between China and Taiwan for diplomatic recognition from Pacific states, Tuvalu's Prime Minister Kausea Natano reaffirms its commitment to Taiwan on a state visit to Taipei.

Turkey media guide,"The media are dominated by pro-government outlets. In the press, critical voices are limited to a few low-circulation publications.
Television is the leading news medium, although audiences are gravitating online. Statements by officials and live speeches by President Erdogan are staple features of coverage. 
State broadcaster TRT operates in many languages, including the main minority language, Kurmanji Kurdish.
The biggest media group is government-friendly Demiroren, which owns the popular Hurriyet and Posta newspapers and CNN Turk and Kanal D TVs.
Critical news outlets can face police raids, tax fines and other hostile measures. Most arrested journalists are charged with membership in, or propaganda for, groups considered as terrorist organisations. 
Reporters for Kurdish media are regularly detained and jailed. ""Insulting the president"" is a crime.
The courts routinely ban websites or block specific pages, including opposition news sites and content deemed to be linked to terrorism.
There were 72.5 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 84% of the population.  About 75% of Turks use social media, which provide alternative voices to pro-government TVs. With mainstream media largely off-limits, independent and pro-opposition voices often rely on them to share news and opinion.
A 2020 law gives the government significant powers to regulate social media content. It obliges major platforms to store user data in Turkey and appoint a local representative to carry out content removal requests.

Thailand country profile,"Thailand is the only country in South East Asia to have escaped colonial rule. Buddhist religion, the monarchy and the military have helped to shape its society and politics.
The military has ruled for most of the period since 1947, with a few interludes in which the country had a democratically elected government. 
Since 2001, Thai politics have been dominated by the deep split between supporters and detractors of Thaksin Shinawatra, who served as prime minister until he was ousted by the military in 2006.
In 2023, Thailand's opposition parties secured by far the largest number of votes in national elections, as voters delivered a significant rebuke to the military-backed government that had ruled since the 2014 coup.
Head of state: King Maha Vajiralongkorn
Thailand is a constitutional monarchy. Maha Vajiralongkorn, the 10th Thai monarch of the Chakri dynasty, was proclaimed king in December 2016.  
He succeeded his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest reigning monarch at the time, who died in October that year. 
Prime minister: Srettha Thavisin
Srettha Thavisin of the populist Pheu Thai party won the backing of parliament to become Thailand's next prime minister in August 2023, paving the way for a new coalition government and putting an end to the political impasse that followed the country's May elections.
The vote came hours after the Pheu Thai party's billionaire figurehead Thaksin Shinawatra made an historic homecoming after years as a fugitive in self-imposed exile.
The progressive Move Forward Party, which won the most votes, was blocked from taking power by conservative senators - all of whom were appointed by the army following its 2014 coup. Thavisin's appointment as prime minister cements his party's coalition with its former military rivals.
Under Thailand's constitution drafted under military rule after the coup, both houses of parliament must vote to select a new prime minister. 
Thailand's military has a seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932.
The government and military control nearly all the national terrestrial television networks, and operate many of Thailand's radio networks.
The media are free to criticise government policies, and cover instances of corruption and human rights abuses. 
However, a strict lese majeste law prohibits media in Thailand from reporting anything that could be deemed critical of the royal family, and journalists tend to exercise self-censorship regarding the military, the judiciary and other sensitive issues.
Some key dates in Thailand's history:
20,000BC - Evidence of continuous human habitation in present-day Thailand from this date onwards.
c. 2000BC - Beginnings of rice cultivation.
c. 1250-1000BC - Ban Chiang in northeast Thailand, currently the earliest known centre of copper and bronze production in South East Asia

Nigeria's ex-oil minister Diezani Alison-Madueke charged with bribery in the UK,"Nigeria's former oil minister Diezani Alison-Madueke has been charged with bribery offences in the UK.
She is suspected of accepting financial rewards for awarding multi-million dollar oil and gas contracts.
A key figure in ex-President Goodluck Jonathan's administration, she also served as the first female president of the oil exporters group Opec.
The 63-year-old, who has been on bail since her arrest in London in 2015, has denied corruption allegations.
Assets worth millions of pounds relating to the alleged offences have been frozen as part of an ongoing probe by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA).
""These charges are a milestone in what has been a thorough and complex international investigation,"" Andy Kelly, from the NCA's International Corruption Unit, said.
The NCA says Ms Alison-Madueke, who served as oil minister from 2010 until 2015, is alleged to have benefited from:
The US Department of Justice has been able to recover assets totalling $53.1m linked to Ms Alison-Madueke's alleged corruption thanks to evidence provided by the NCA in March, the agency says.
The NCA added that its agents had also worked closely with Nigeria's anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
Last year, the EFCC said about $153m and more than 80 properties had been recovered from the politician, who was in the cabinet from 2007.
She first held the post of transport minister, then moved to the ministry of mines before taking over the oil portfolio.
Ms Alison-Madueke, who currently lives in London's St John's Wood suburb, will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on 2 October, the NCA says.
Nigeria is one of the world's largest oil producers, but few of its more than 225 million inhabitants have benefited from this wealth.
It is one of the 13 members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), set up to deal with the worldwide supply of oil and its price.

Paraguay country profile,"Landlocked Paraguay is surrounded by Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil.
Political unrest, corruption and chronic economic problems have plagued its fragile democracy since it emerged from the 35-year dictatorship of the Alfredo Stroessner in 1989. 
The economy is reliant on agriculture and hydroelectric power. Unlike its neighbours, Paraguay does not have a large tourism industry.
Most of the population is of mixed Spanish and Guarani descent, and speak the indigenous language Guarani as well as Spanish.
The Triple Frontier region, where Paraguay meets Argentina and Brazil, has long been associated with drug-smuggling and other contraband trade.
President: Santiago Peña
Santiago Peña, an economist and former finance minister, won the April 2023 presidential election with more than 42% of the votes for the Colorado Party - the party that has dominated Paraguayan politics for more than 70 years.
Speaking after his election victory, Mr Peña called for nationwide unity and consensus. Paraguay's economy is expected to grow by more than 4% in 2023, but the country has relatively high levels of poverty and corruption.
He has pledged business-friendly policies focused on job creation, low taxes and attracting foreign investment to Paraguay's agriculture-dependent economy recover after the Covid pandemic and a 2022 drought.
He has promised to stick with Paraguay's decades-long diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Private and public outlets make up the broadcasting landscape and media ownership is highly concentrated.
The media operate with few official curbs. Crime reporting can be perilous in an area bordering Brazil and Argentina. 
Some key dates in Paraguay's history:
1500s - Originally inhabited by the indigenous Guarani people before the arrival of the first Spanish settlers.
1526 - Italian navigator Sebastian Cabot explores the rivers of Paraguay.
1537 - Spanish begin colonising the interior plains of Paraguay.
1609 - Spanish Jesuits begin converting the local population to Roman Catholicism.
1776 - Paraguay transferred from the Vice-royalty of Peru to the Vice-royalty of La Plata, which has its capital at Buenos Aires in Argentina.
1808 - Vice-royalty of La Plata becomes autonomous following the overthrow of the Spanish monarchy by Napoleon Bonaparte, but Paraguayans revolt against Buenos Aires.
1811 - Paraguay becomes independent.
1864-70 - War of the Triple Alliance against Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, the bloodiest inter-state war in Latin American history. Paraguay loses almost 40% of its pre-war claimed territories. Much of the civilian population dies due to battle, hunger, and disease
1932-35 - Paraguay wins territory in the west from similarly landlocked Bolivia during the Chaco War fought for control of the northern part of the Gran Chaco region, which was thought to be rich in oil.
1947 - Following a brief civil war, the right-wing Colorado Party dominates politics for the next 60 years.
1954 - General Alfredo Stroessner seizes power in coup, ushering in 35 years of ruthless dictatorship.
1989 - Stroessner deposed in coup led by Gen Andres Rodriguez, who is then elected president. However, Stroessner's centre-right, military-backed National Republican Association-Colorado Party wins parliamentary elections.
1992 - New constitution paves the way for free elections. Despite a failed coup attempt in 1996 and a succession of presidents, there is a long period of political instability and party infighting.
2006 - Former military ruler Alfredo Stroessner dies in exile in Brazil, aged 93.
2008 - Six decades of rule by the right-wing Colorado Party is brought to an end when former bishop Fernando Lugo is elected president, but the party returns to power in 2013 with the election of political newcomer Horacio Cartes
2014 - The Ache' indigenous people of Paraguay file a lawsuit accusing the former military government of genocide during Stroessner's dictatorship.
2015 - Albino Jara, the leader of Paraguay's second biggest rebel group the Armed Peasant Association (ACA), is shot dead by the army. The ACA is a spin-off of the country's main left-wing rebel group, the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP). 
2017 - World Health Organization certifies Paraguay as malaria-free, making it the first country in the Americas to achieve this status since Cuba in 1973. 
2022 - Osvaldo Villalba, the leader of the armed left-wing rebels the Paraguayan People's Army is killed in a clash with soldiers. The EPP has carried out a string of killings and kidnappings in Paraguay, including kidnapping former vice-president Óscar Denis.

What is Pakistan's homemade cable car system?,"Eight people, including children, were left stranded in a cable car dangling above a ravine in Pakistan's north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Tuesday.
Footage of the chair lift, dangling precariously at 274m (900ft) above ground, is the stuff of nightmares for many. 
But makeshift cable cars are widely used in eastern Mansehra and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and stretch all the way up to Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan in the north.
With little infrastructure in the area and long-distances between facilities like schools - the cable cars, often thrown together with scrap metal - are born from necessity. 
They are built by local communities - mostly illegally, because it is cheaper and there is no alternative infrastructure.
Sometimes they are made of the upper body of a pick-up truck. For example, a Suzuki may be converted into a large cabin used to transport people and cattle. They are then attached to the cable - which can also be scrap iron - using ropes. 
Though dangerous, people often use them to cross rivers and to shorten the distance needed to travel between valleys in the mountains. 
In Allai - the mountainous area where the group were trapped on Tuesday - there is no road infrastructure or basic facilities.
As a result, a local resident obtained permission from the city administration to build the cable car, police confirmed to BBC News. 
Known to locals as ""Dolly"", it links the village of Jangri to Batangi, where the local school is located.
What would usually be a two-hour walk was reduced to just four minutes in the cable car.
Police said they checked the lift every month, however BBC News has been unable to independently verify this. 
The affordability of the Allai cable car also makes it an attractive mode of transport.
It costs far less than road travel, and while the fare varies depending on the distance being travelled, it begins from as little as 20 PKR (£0.053; $0.067).
One local, Mohabbat Shah, said residents were willing to take the risk with the cable cars. Since there had been no problems with these particular cars before, they were a good option for people trying to move around the region. 
""We pay only 10 rupees per person on a one way trip. If we book a cab, this will cost up to 2000 rupees (£18.91; $24.09)"", he told the BBC.
While this particular cable car had not yet encountered any challenges, others across Pakistan have.
In 2017, an illegal car crashed in Murree, Punjab, killing 11 passengers as it plummeted into a ravine. 
And last December, local media reported that 12 children had to be rescued after a rope snapped in Abbottabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Those children were on their way to school, and were stranded 61m over a river until they could be rescued. 
Following Tuesday's incident, Pakistan's caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar ordered ""safety inspections of all such private chairlifts to ensure that they are safe to operate and use.""
But without significant investments into new infrastructure, the lifts will continue to be the main mode of transport for most people in the mountainous region.

Moscow sewer: All eight members of tour party confirmed dead in floods,"A tour guide and all seven members of their party have been found dead after being trapped underground by flood waters in Moscow's sewer system, Russian media say.
Sunday's floods, caused by heavy rain, were so rapid people could not escape.
The group was exploring the underground Neglinka, a tributary of the city's main river, the Moskva.
The search operation had ended and efforts were being made to formally identify the dead, investigators said.
City Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Monday described the incident as a ""terrible tragedy"".
Several companies offer tours of the city's sewers, some of which date from the 19th Century.
Most of the victims appear to have been washed into the Moskva and were found by divers near the city's central Zaryadye park.
A criminal investigation has been launched into what was described as an ""illegal excursion"" amid allegations that safety standards were not adhered to.
Investigators said they had identified three people involved in organising the tour. At least one has been arrested and charged, they said, but another is thought to have left the country for the United Arab Emirates.
Originally more than 20 people signed up for the tour, the Ria news agency said, although most of them later withdrew because of the weather forecast.

Rugby World Cup: Wales co-captain Dewi Lake's dreams become reality,"Less than two weeks ago, Dewi Lake hobbled off the Twickenham pitch, covering his eyes to hide the tears. 
It seemed to many that his dream of representing Wales at next month's World Cup in France could be over.
But on Monday, the 24-year-old from Bridgend was named co-captain for the tournament alongside Jac Morgan.
After the injury scare, being chosen to lead his country was testament to his determination, according to his former teacher Caryl James.
She said she was ""just devastated"" watching him get injured against England, adding: ""They zoomed in on his face and you could see the pain. 
""He had worked so hard to recover, I was really hoping he was set up for a good run. It will just make him stronger. The character he is, he will just work harder.""
Injuries meant he had not played for Wales for more than a year, and the hooker lasted just 25 minutes of his return. 
This put in doubt his World Cup participation right up until the moment the squad was announced live on S4C on Monday. 
But maybe those closest to the former pupil of Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Llangynwyd, in Bridgend, always knew he would make it.
Ms James told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""A few months ago, I rang Dewi because I was doing a noticeboard in the school, and I wanted some inspirational quotes from sports personnel.
""His was just to never give up, to dream big because everything's worth having, but requires a lot of hard work.""
This determination he showed to make the squad was obvious to her throughout his school life. 
From the ""extraordinary power"" he showed in gymnastics classes to ""all the energy"" and leadership skills that brought everyone else's standards up in class.
He was also ""a big dreamer since a very young age"", and in his coursework for his GCSEs and A-levels, it was evident he wanted to play for Wales and captain his country.
But while this focus was generally admired by his teachers, it did occasionally bring stern words.
""I had to phone his mum and get him to put his coursework in on time, but she kept saying 'he's in the gym, he's in the gym, I can't get him out',"" his teacher said. 
""So I had to tell him not to go and get it finished.""
In France, he will lead his country alongside Ospreys teammate Jac Morgan, 23, the two Welsh speakers giving their first interview in the language after being appointed, describing their almost surreal journeys.
Lake said there was not ""another person I would rather be sharing this with"".
Morgan smiled and added: ""I would never have thought this (possible) four years ago when we were playing together for the under-20s.""
But his teacher Carys Wilkins knew it would one day become reality from as far back as his primary school days. 
""This hasn't come as a surprise to me at all because from a very young age, he understood the game, he stood out as an exceptional player,"" she said. 
""So fair play to him he deserves everything that's coming his way.""
His former teacher at Ysgol Gynradd Brynaman, Carmarthenshire, described him as ""being excited but also nervous"" about what is to come, yet ""his feet are firmly on the ground"".
Ms Wilkins coached Morgan at under-11s and her reaction to his success at that level suggest there could be tears in the coming weeks.
""I remember when he had his first cap for west Wales, I was quite emotional,"" she said. 
""But seeing him on a world stage at the French World Cup would be something else.""

"Sara Sharif: Community reeling after death of 10-year-old, local MP says","A community is ""reeling"" after a 10-year-old girl was found dead at her home in Woking, the local MP has said.
Sara Sharif was found on 10 August prompting a murder inquiry and international manhunt.
Jonathan Lord said the initial reaction was to ""want to blame not just the perpetrators but to find out why a little girl is dead"".
Surrey County Council confirmed Sara was known to the authorities and a multi-agency review was under way.
On Monday police began a search of the family's previous address in Eden Grove Road, West Byfleet.
Surrey Police said they expect that search to take about a week.
Speaking to BBC Radio Surrey, Mr Lord said this was a ""shocking case"" but described Woking as a ""resilient place"".
""Our churches have been praying, our mosques have been praying,"" he said, adding that the community would ""bounce back"".
""Whenever one of these cases occurs, and there have been others, everyone immediately sympathises, empathises, with the young person that would appear to have been abused,"" he said.
Mr Lord said people would be ""very interested to learn more about the contact"" between Sara and the authorities.
""We're so shocked, so upset and so sad about this that the initial reaction is to want to blame not just the perpetrators but to find out why a little girl is dead.""
He said young people ""have been let down in the past by agencies"" but urged people not to ""jump to conclusions"", adding that cases like this were ""very, very rare"".
He said the review, as well as the police investigation, would help authorities to ""learn lessons"" and ""minimise the risk of this sort of tragedy happening again"".
After it was revealed that Sara had been known to Surrey authorities, campaigner on children's social care Chris Wild, who advised the government's most recent review into children's social care, told the BBC's World at One programme this meant Sara would have been ""on their radar"", and there may have been a child protection order in place, or a safeguarding concern made.
""When these things happen of course they're avoidable. Hindsight's a wonderful thing, but when you look at things like this, when you start looking at what prevention has been put in place, you find you can avoid things like this happening.
""I'd be interested to see, when this does come to fruition, what has actually happened and in what respect she [Sara] was known to local authorities,"" he said.
Three people who travelled to Pakistan before Sara's body was found are wanted for questioning by Surrey Police. They are Sara's father, Urfan Sharif, 41, his partner, Beinash Batool, 29, and his brother, Faisal Malik, 28.
Surrey Police have said Mr Sharif made a 999 call from Pakistan shortly after landing in Islamabad with his partner, his brother and five children, aged between one and 13.
The call led officers to the house in Woking where they found the body of Sara, who had suffered ""multiple and extensive injuries"", likely to have been caused over a sustained period of time.

China media guide,"China is the largest media market in the world, and has the world's largest online population. 
Outlets operate under tight Communist Party control. The opening-up of the industry has extended to distribution and advertising, not to editorial content. However, there is leeway for independent coverage that is not perceived as a threat to social stability or the Party.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has described President Xi Jinping as the ""planet's leading censor and press freedom predator"". 
It says government policies are aimed at achieving ""complete hegemony over news coverage and the creation of an international media order heavily influenced by China"".  
Beijing tries to limit access to foreign news by restricting rebroadcasting and the use of satellite receivers, by jamming shortwave broadcasts, including those of the BBC, and by blocking websites. 
Overseas Chinese-language news outlets that are not state-owned are blocked in mainland China. However, international English language websites like the BBC are often available to view. But content that is contrary to Communist Party rhetoric is filtered and English-language news sites can be filtered at times of tension. 
Fears that the media in Hong Kong would lose their independence when the territory reverted to Chinese control in 1997 have generally not been borne out. Hong Kong still has editorially-dynamic media, but worries about interference remain.
TV is available in most homes and the sector is competitive, especially in cities. There are more than 3,300 local, regional and national TV channels.
State-run Chinese Central TV (CCTV) is China's largest media company. Its dominance is challenged by provincial TVs, which are on the air nationally via satellite. China is a major market for pay TV, which is almost entirely delivered by cable. All of China's 2,600-plus radio stations are state-owned.
There are around 1,900 newspapers. Each city has its own title, usually published by the local government, as well as a local Communist Party daily. 
China spends hugely on TV, radio, online and press outlets targeted at international audiences, aiming to extend its political influence and boost its image. It is less keen to allow foreign players into the domestic market. 
China has the world's largest internet-using population. There were 1.01 billion internet users by July 2022, comprising 69% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com).
Around 26% of the online population live in rural areas. The China Internet Network Information Centre (CNNIC) says 98% of China's online population can access the internet via a smartphone. 
There are three powerful online giants, known collectively as ""BAT"": Baidu is the top search engine; e-commerce leader Alibaba has allied with Sina, which operates the Weibo microblog platform; and Tencent owns instant messenger WeChat.
Because of official censorship, Weibo is losing some of its appeal as a forum where relatively uncensored news can be shared. 
WeChat, Tencent's take on the WhatsApp instant messenger, has the largest number of domestic users of any social media service in China.
China has the world's largest online video market. Streaming platforms, including market leader iQiyi, Youku Tudou and Sohu have a huge following and pose a challenge to traditional TV.
An extensive web filtering system, dubbed the ""Great Firewall of China"", blocks tens of thousands of sites using URL filtering and keyword censoring.
Thousands of cyber-police watch the web and material deemed politically and socially sensitive is filtered. Blocked resources include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and human rights sites.
The use of circumvention tools, including virtual private networks (VPNs), became harder after China strengthened its firewall to allow it to intercept data traffic to and from individual IP addresses. This was coined the ""Great Fire Cannon"" when it came into effect in 2015. 
The government since has signalled that it will ban unapproved VPNs.

Iceland media guide,"National public radio and TV is provided by the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service (RUV), which is owned by the state.
The RUV is tasked with promoting the Icelandic language and culture. It is funded from a licence fee and advertising revenue.
Media ownership is highly concentrated. The 365 company runs the main private TV and radio stations and the highest-circulating newspaper, Frettabladid. 
The constitution guarantees ""absolute"" press freedom, but the situation for journalists has worsened in recent years because of poor relations between politicians and the media, says Reporters Without Borders.
Legislation passed in 2010 aims to give greater protection to journalists and whistleblowers than any other such law in the world. 
A 2019 study, based on OECD data, found that Iceland had the highest level of online news consumption, with about 93% of the population getting news updates online, rather than traditional media.
There were 343,000 internet users by July 2022, comprising 99% pf the population (Internetworldstats.com).

Pakistan cable car - 'save our children',"This video can not be played
A man whose son was stuck inside a cable car in Pakistan spoke to the BBC after initial rescue attempts.
Maulana Abdul Qayyum said his son was on his way to school.
Rescuers had struggled to free six school children and two adults from a cable car dangling above a river bank in Pakistan. 
Repeated attempts were made by helicopters to approach the car, but strong winds hindered the operation.
All occupants of the dangling cable car were eventually rescued.

Iceland country profile,"A sparsely-populated North Atlantic island, Iceland is famous for its hot springs, geysers and active volcanoes. Lava fields cover much of the land and hot water is pumped from under the ground to supply much of the country's heating.
Iceland became an independent republic in 1944 and went on to become one of the world's most prosperous economies. However, the collapse of the banking system in 2008 exposed that prosperity as having been built on a dangerously vulnerable economic model.
The affluence enjoyed by Icelanders before 2008 initially rested on the fishing industry, but with the gradual contraction of this sector the Icelandic economy developed into new areas.
President: Gudni Johannesson
University historian Gudni Johannesson won Iceland's presidential election in June 2016 with 39.1% of the vote. He was reelected in 2020 with 92.2% of the vote.
Mr Johanesson succeeded Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, who stepped down in August 2016 after 20 years. 
He has has emphasized the importance of unity for a small country like Iceland. He is not affiliated to any political party.  
Prime minister: Katrin Jakobsdottir
Katrin Jakobsdottir was returned as prime minister in the September 2021 general elections heading the coalition government. 
The Independence Party, Progressive Party and Left-Green Movement - agreed to continue with Jakobsdottir, who heads the Left-Green Movement, remaining prime minister despite her party being the smallest of the three.
She became prime minister after her Left-Green Movement agreed to form a coalition government in November 2017. 
She opposes Icelandic membership of Nato but the government is not intending to withdraw from the alliance or hold a referendum on membership as part of the compromise between the Left-Greens and their coalition partners.
The government does not intend to hold a referendum on restarting Iceland's accession negotiations with the EU.
National public radio and TV are provided by the state-owned Icelandic National Broadcasting Service (RUV).
Ownership of private media is highly concentrated. The constitution guarantees press freedom.

"Palestinian militant, 17, killed during Israeli West Bank raid","Israeli forces have shot dead a 17-year-old Palestinian militant during a series of overnight detention raids in the occupied West Bank.
Residents said Othman Abu Kharj was killed in the village of Zababdeh, near Jenin, after the army entered, sparking confrontations with locals. 
The army did not comment directly on his death, but said ""explosive devices"" were thrown by Palestinians.
Witnesses said troops shot the teenager near a house that had been surrounded.
The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad claimed Abu Kharj as a fighter in their ""rapid response unit"". 
The army raids took place in at least 20 locations across the West Bank following the killing of three Israelis in separate attacks by Palestinian gunmen this week.
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, pledged to ""settle the score with the murderers and those who send them, near and far"". He ultimately blamed the killings on Iran, which backs Islamic Jihad and the largest Palestinian militant group, Hamas. 
The Palestinian Prisoners Club said more than 50 people were held overnight, accusing Israel of collective punishment and ""vandalism"" of families' homes. 
Also during Monday night's raids, a Palestinian man was critically injured after being shot in the head by Israeli forces in a village near Nablus. Video appeared to show him unarmed and running towards an injured person before being hit by a single shot. 
The West Bank is in the grip of the worst violence in two decades amid the absence of any political solution to the conflict, while Israel's military occupation is now into its 57th year. 
Israel has the most ultranationalist government in its history in which politicians now routinely call for more strident military operations and further Israeli settlement expansion. 
Meanwhile, internecine divisions have seen Palestinian political rivalries deepen and its official leadership lose control of key West Bank cities to militant groups. 
On Saturday, a Palestinian gunman shot dead two Israelis - a father and son - at a car wash in the northern West Bank town of Hawara, the site of repeated violence by both armed Palestinians and mobs of Israeli settlers this year. 
In the south of the West Bank on Monday, Palestinian gunmen fired at least 20 rounds at a car near Hebron, killing an Israeli woman from a nearby settlement, Batsheva Nigri. The male driver was seriously wounded while Ms Nigri's 12-year-old daughter was unharmed.
Last week, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy was left seriously wounded after being shot in the head by Israeli forces in occupied East Jerusalem. Police alleged he had tried to throw a petrol bomb at them during a raid. 
The same day video showed an apparently unarmed Palestinian man said to suffer from mental health problems being shot and wounded by Israeli troops during a protest near Israel's separation barrier in Qalqilya. The army said it was investigating. 
The violence is adding to a deteriorating political atmosphere and fuelling more aggressive rhetoric. 
Following the attacks against Israelis, far-right online chat groups followed by hundreds of Israeli settlers called for ""revenge"" against Palestinians and the ethnic cleansing of the town of Hawara. 
Pro-settler National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who leads the ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, appeared to brief against his cabinet colleague, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, implying he was weak on security, while another MP from the party called on Mr Gallant to resign. 
Meanwhile, Hamas praised Monday's attack near Hebron, calling it a ""natural response"" to Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and linked it to ""threats"" on the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. The militant group Islamic Jihad said it sent a warning ""that what is coming will be more severe and harsh"".
In July, the army carried out its biggest military assault in years on Jenin refugee camp, in which 12 Palestinians, including militants and children, were killed.
An Israeli soldier also died during the raid, and on Tuesday the army said he was killed by fire from his fellow soldiers ""following an incident of mistaken identification"".
Tuesday's overnight raids saw troops detain two Palestinians suspected of carrying out Monday's attack near Hebron, the army said. 
Mr Gallant said: ""The terrorists who brutally murdered Batsheva Nigri will spend the rest of their days in prison. We will employ all means to strengthen our security. We will pursue and find our enemies.""
At least 219 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and 31 Israelis have been killed this year.

Lithuania media guide,"Lithuania's private broadcasters compete with the public networks run by Lithuanian National Radio and Television (LRT).
TV is the most popular medium and the sector includes digital terrestrial, cable and online outlets.
The popularity of print media is declining, reflecting a global trend. Some former print titles have relocated online.
Media ownership is concentrated among a small number of domestic and foreign companies. 
Although the media are free and operate independently of the state, anti-Western rhetoric from Russian media targeting the Baltic states has prompted tighter controls.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Lithuania blocked the rebroadcasting of six Russian-language TV channels in the country over their incitement of war and propaganda.
There were 2.6 million internet users by December 2021, comprising 95% of the population (Internetworldstats.com). Around 1.7 million Lithuanians use Facebook. 
The BBC World Service broadcasts in Vilnius on 95.5 FM.

Ukrainian drone destroys Russian supersonic bomber,"A flagship Russian long-range bomber has been destroyed in a Ukrainian drone strike, according to reports.
Images posted on social media and analysed by BBC Verify show a Tupolev Tu-22M on fire at Soltsy-2 airbase, south of St Petersburg.
Moscow said that a drone was hit by small-arms fire but managed to ""damage"" a plane. Ukraine has not commented.
The Tu-22M can travel at twice the speed of sound and has been used extensively to attack Ukraine.
The Russian defence ministry said in a statement that an attack by a ""copter-type UAV"" took place at around 10:00 Moscow time (07:00 GMT) on Saturday. 
It stated the location as ""a military airfield in the Novgorod region"", where Soltsy-2 is situated.
""The UAV was detected by the airfield's observation outpost and was hit with small-arms fire,"" the ministry said.
""One airplane was damaged; there were no casualties as a result of the terrorist act.""
The statement also said a fire which broke out in the airfield parking lot was quickly extinguished. 
However, images posted on the social media platform Telegram showed a large fire engulfing a jet with the distinctive nose cone of the Tu-22M.  BBC Verify analysed the images and believes them to be credible.
The UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence briefing that it was ""highly likely destroyed"" in the attack on Soltsy-2.
While the destruction of a single aircraft will have little effect on the potency of Moscow's current 60-strong fleet, the operation highlights Kyiv's growing ability to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. 
Kyiv has over recent months launched dozens of fixed-wing unmanned aircraft to attack Moscow, several hundred miles away. Soltsy-2 is around 400 miles (650km) from the Ukraine border.
However, the Russian MoD's description of the drone as a ""copter-type UAV"" suggests a cheap, commercially available device launched at short range.
The Tu-22M is a Cold War-era, swing-wing supersonic bomber, codenamed ""Backfire"" by Nato, which has been used extensively in attacks on Ukrainian cities. 
Modern versions such as the Tu-22M3 can reach speeds of Mach 2 (2,300km/h or 1,430mp/h) and can carry up to 24,000kg of weapons, including ""dumb bombs"" and homing missiles.
They have been used in conflicts in Syria, Chechnya, and Georgia and most recently in Ukraine. 
According to prosecutors in Kyiv, 30 people were killed when a Tu-22M-launched missile hit a block of flats in Dnipro in January. 
They said Russia's 52nd Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment carried out the attack. The regiment is based at Soltsy-2.
BBC Verify confirmed the location of the Ukrainian drone attack on Soltsy-2 by comparing visual clues - such as the appearance of aircraft and bays - to historical satellite images of the airbase. 
The weather conditions at the time - wet and overcast - also matched the weather in the images, as well as other witness photos of the incident.
The remnants of the aircraft visible in the footage are consistent with that of a Tu-22M3. 
Historical satellite imagery analysed by BBC Verify shows that aircraft of this kind were stationed at the base.
On Monday, a spokesperson for Ukraine's defence intelligence service said another military aircraft had been damaged in a drone attack in Russia's Kaluga region. 
Russian media also reported the attack, but denied there had been any damage.

Latvia media guide,"Latvia's media scene is diverse, but reflects the division of society into Latvian- and Russian-speaking audiences.
Ownership of the most popular media outlets is highly concentrated. The print media have lost readers to online outlets.
Television is the most popular platform, although viewing figures are declining. TV and the sector is dominated by the top commercial station TV3 and two public networks 
International watchdogs rate the media environment as free, but point to difficulties in accessing trustworthy information in Russian.
The invasion of Ukraine led to the blocking of dozens of Russian media outlets in Latvia. 
However the presence of a large Russian-speaking community means the country remains vulnerable to Kremlin disinformation and other forms of information aggression.
Some Russian outlets have moved to Latvia in search of media freedom but liberal-leaning Dozhd TV's broadcasting licence in Latvia was withdrawn.
Public Latvian Radio (LR) dominates the radio market, thanks partly to the popularity of music station Radio 2. Public radio and TV are financed by state subsidies and advertising.
The BBC World Service in English is relayed in Riga on 100.5 FM. 
There were 1.6 million internet users by December 2021, comprising 88% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com). Latvian social network Draugiem.lv rivals Facebook in popularity.
Inbox.lv portal, offering email, dating and photo services, is one of the most-visited sites.

Kaliningrad profile,"The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea is sandwiched between Poland to the south and Lithuania to the north and east.
It saw bitter fighting and suffered extensive destruction during World War Two. The German population was expelled or fled after the war ended and it was annexed by the USSR from Germany. It was a closed military zone throughout the Soviet period.
Koenigsberg, as the city of Kaliningrad was once known, was founded by Teutonic knights in the 13th Century. It became one of the cities of the Hanseatic League and was once the capital of Prussia. The philosopher Immanuel Kant spent all his life in the city and died there in 1804.
During the Soviet period, the Kaliningrad oblast or region, administratively part of the Russian Federation, was separated from the rest of Russia, more than 300km to the east, by the then Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Belarus.
Since Lithuania and Poland joined the EU in 2004 it has been impossible to travel between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia over land without crossing the territory of at least one EU state. There has been friction, particularly with Lithuania, over transit regulations.
Kaliningrad is still of great strategic importance to Moscow. It houses the Russian Baltic Fleet at the port of Baltiysk and is the country's only ice-free European port.
During the Soviet period, agriculture was a key industry. The market for Kaliningrad's produce was largely dismantled with the collapse of the USSR, causing the economy to nosedive in the early 1990s.
Unemployment soared and poverty became very widespread, particularly in rural areas. Organised crime and drugs became increasingly problematic.
In a bid to tackle the region's problems, in 1996 the Russian authorities granted it special economic status and tax advantages intended to attract investors. The region's economy benefited substantially.
Kaliningrad underwent an unprecedented boom, and in 2007 a new $45m airport terminal was opened.
The region began to see increasing trade with the countries of the EU as well as increasing economic growth and rising industrial output.
However, the global financial crisis of 2008-9 affected the region badly, and by the beginning of 2010 unemployment had climbed to over 10% - considerably higher than the Russian average.
In 2013, Russia deployed short-range Iskander ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads in the region, in what it said was a response to US plans to deploy a ballistic missile defence system in Europe.
In June 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania implemented EU sanctions on certain Russian goods - including construction materials - and banned their movement by rail across its territory.
Kaliningrad is heavily reliant on transit routes from the rest of Russia through Lithuania, and the move angered Russia. Lithuania lifted the ban a month later when the EU clarified that the sanctions applied to road and not rail.

Estonia country profile,"Estonia is the most northerly of the three Baltic states, and has linguistic ties with Finland.
Since regaining its independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Estonia has become one of the most economically successful of the EU's eastern European members. Estonia joined both the EU and Nato in 2004.
Ruled at various times during the middle ages by Denmark, the German knights of the Livonian Order, and Sweden, Estonia ended up part of the Russian Empire in the 18th Century.
It experienced its first period of independence in 1918, following the end of World War One and the collapse of the Russian Empire.
President: Alan Karis
Alar Karis was elected by Parliament on 31 August 2021, replacing Kersti Kaljulaid.
Estonia is one of the few parliamentary republics in which the president is a ceremonial figurehead without even nominal executive powers. The president is not directly elected by voters, but by parliament.
Prime minister: Kaja Kallas
Kaja Kallas was reelected as prime minister when her centre-right Reform party secured first place in the March 2023 elections, ahead of the far-right EKRE party. The result means Tallinn remains one of Europe's most staunchly pro-Kyiv governments.
Kallas said the election left her party in a strong position to form a coalition government that would keep up calling for pressure on Russia.
Speaking after her election win she said that ""we ... have to invest in our security, our aggressive neighbour has not vanished and will not vanish, so we have to work with that"".
She became Estonia's first woman prime minister in January 2021, after her Reform Party formed a coalition with the Centre Party.
She replaced Juri Ratas, the Centre Party leader who had governed with the far-right EKRE party before his administration fell in a corruption scandal. 
Television is Estonia's most popular medium, while print media are losing ground to online outlets.
The broadcasting industry has attracted foreign media groups; the main privately-owned TVs are run by Swedish and Norwegian concerns.
Eesti Televisioon (ETV) and Eesti Raadio (ER) are public broadcasters. Take-up of cable and digital terrestrial TV is extensive; the offering includes stations in Finnish, Swedish, Russian and Latvian.

Finland country profile,"In spite of its relatively small population, Finland has been a trendsetter in many fields since independence in 1917. 
It scores consistently well on international ratings for stability, freedom, public safety and social progress
Its parliament was the first to adopt full gender equality, granting men and women the right not only to vote but also to stand for election in 1906. 
Finland declared independence from Russia in 1917 but following  defeat by the Soviet Union in World War Two, it had to tolerate strong influence from Moscow until the end of the Cold War. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw a sea-change in Finland's foreign policy, and it is now a member of Nato. 
President: Sauli Niinisto
Sauli Niinisto won the presidential election in 2012 to become the country's first conservative head of state in five decades.
The victory of the pro-Europe politician suggested that voters wanted to keep the country in the eurozone, despite misgivings over European Union bailouts.
Mr Niinisto is credited with leading Finland's economy towards growth following the collapse of the Soviet Union during his tenure as finance minister from 1996 to 2001.
Finland's president has a largely ceremonial role with fewer powers now than in previous decades, but can be an important shaper of public opinion.
Mr Niinisto comfortably won a second term in the January 2018 election.
Prime Minister: Petteri Orpo
Conservative leader Petteri Orpo won a close three-way election in April 2023, defeating the centre-left incumbant Sanna Marin. 
His National Coalition Party secured 20.8% of the vote, ahead of the right-wing populist Finns Party on 20.1% and Marin's centre-left Social Democrats on 19.9%.
He leads a coalition of the conservative NCP, nationalist Finns, the minority-language Swedish People's Party and the Christian Democrat.
Orpo, who defines himself as a ""fiscal conservative"", campaigned on a platform of reducing Finland's government debt and the annual budget deficit as well as cutting income taxes. 
The election was largely fought on Finland's economy as all the mainstream parties backed Nato membership. 
TV is the most popular medium. Public broadcaster Yle operates alongside commercial networks. 
The state of media freedom is rated highly by international press freedom organisations.

Latvia country profile,"Situated in north-eastern Europe with a coastline along the Baltic Sea, Latvia has borders with Estonia, Russia, Belarus and Lithuania. It has linguistic links with Lithuania to the south, and historical and religious ties with Estonia to the north.
Not much more than a decade after it regained independence during the demise of the Soviet Union, Latvia joined the European Union and Nato in 2004.
For centuries Latvia was primarily an agricultural country, with seafaring, fishing and forestry as other important economic factors.
Like its Baltic neighbours, Latvia has made a rapid transition to the free market since the early 1990s. It adopted the euro as its currency in 2014.
Some 24% of the population is primarily Russian-speaking, and Russian propaganda efforts in this community are a cause of concern for the Latvian authorities. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Latvia has banned all Russian broadcast channels.
President: Edgars Rinkevics
Latvia's long-serving foreign minister Edgars Rinkevics became the first openly gay head of state of a European Union nation after being elected by parliament to the post in July 2023.
Mr Rinkevics had served as foreign minister since 2011. Although generally a ceremonial position, Latvia's president can veto legislation and call referendums.
In his inaugural speech, Mr Rinkevics vowed to continue supporting Ukraine's war effort against Russia. He said Latvia's foreign policy ""does not have time for mistakes"", adding he would act ""quickly, decisively and wisely"".
Prime minister: Arturs Krisjanis Karins
Arturs Krisjanis Karins became prime minister in January 2019 at the head of a coalition of five conservative and liberal parties, excluding the pro-Russia Harmony party that had emerged as the largest bloc in parliament after the October 2018 elections.
Mr Karins was born in the US to Latvian parents, and earned a doctorate in linguistics before emigrating to Latvia and going into business.
He was elected to parliament in 2002 as an MP for the centre-right New Era Party, and went on to serve as economy minister before becoming a member of the European Parliament.
He was the conservative Unity party's candidate for premiership at the 2018 election. 
The media operate freely, with few legal restrictions. A law provides prison terms for libel and incitement of racial hatred.

"Portugal's drug consumption rooms are important, users say","This video can not be played
Scotland continues to have the worst drug death rate in the UK and the rest of Europe, with narcotics claiming about 90 lives on average every month.
The Scottish government is proposing to decriminalise the possession of drugs for personal use to ""help and support people rather than criminalise and stigmatise them"".
But the UK government, which controls drugs policy, has rejected the plan as dangerous and says it has no intention of giving the Scottish Parliament the power to enact the new policy.
In setting out their proposals, Scottish National Party (SNP) ministers cited Portugal, which relaxed its drug laws in 2001, as a potential model.
Despite having almost double the population of Scotland - 10.3 million compared with 5.5 million - Portugal has far fewer drug deaths. There were just 74 in 2021 compared with 1,330 in Scotland in the same year - the latest for which comparable data is available - although the rate in Scotland has since fallen.
Luis Miguel Pereira, from Portugal, started using drugs at the age of 14. Nearly four decades later, he is HIV-positive and remains hooked on cocaine and heroin.
As a child, Mr Pereira said he had a good life, studying and playing football, ""but when I start to take drugs, everything changes.""
""It's like a prison,"" he said. ""You are locked inside of the drugs. You wake up thinking drugs. You lay down thinking drugs. It's the only thought that you think in your mind.""
Speaking about Portugal's drug consumption rooms, he says: ""It's important because we have a place to consume. We don't need to hide.""

Crispin Dye: New person of interest identified in AC/DC manager death,"New forensic evidence has identified a person of interest in the 1993 death of Australian rock band AC/DC's former manager, Crispin Dye.
The 41-year-old died on Christmas Day, two days after he was found with severe head injuries in an inner city Sydney suburb.
New testing found DNA on Mr Dye's jeans matched DNA from another crime scene.
His death is being examined as part of a broader inquiry into gay hate crimes in New South Wales (NSW).
The inquiry heard that despite multiple police investigations, at no stage since his death almost 30 years ago had Mr Dye's clothes been sent for forensic examination.
It also found that two pieces of paper found in Mr Dye's pocket had not been analysed, despite one having a name written on it - and another a blood stain. 
The person of interest, named only as NP252, died in 2002. It is not clear if he played a role in Mr Crispin's death based on current available information.
The inquiry heard NP252 had a substantive criminal history - including other assault convictions. 
The inquiry into gay hate crimes commenced in April 2022 after research from the Australian Institute of Criminology questioned whether police had sufficiently investigated deaths between 1976 and 2000.
In 2018, police acknowledged that they had previously played a part in ""marginalising"" the LGBT community.
""[New South Wales Police] acknowledges without qualification both its and society's acceptance of gay bashings and shocking violence directed at gay men, and the LGBT community between 1976 and 2000,"" it said in a statement.
It added: ""There were certainly people murdered because of their sexuality during this time.""
The Institute of Criminology found up to 80 gay men were killed between 1976-2000 and found that violence towards gay men during the period was ""extreme and often brutal"".
Homosexuality was decriminalised in NSW in 1984. Violence against LGBT people was common but rarely investigated.

Turkey country profile,"Once the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the modern Republic of Turkey was established in 1923 by nationalist leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
Straddling the continents of Europe and Asia, Turkey's strategically important location has given it major influence in the region - and control over the entrance to the Black Sea.
Progress towards democracy and a market economy was halting after Ataturk's death in 1938. The army, seeing itself as guarantor of the constitution, repeatedly ousted governments in the second half of the 20th Century.
Joining the European Union has been a longstanding ambition. Membership talks were launched in 2005, but have stalled over serious misgivings about Turkey's human rights record. 
Kurds make up about a fifth of the population. Kurdish separatists who accuse the Turkish state of seeking to destroy their cultural identity have been waging a guerrilla war since the 1980s. 
President: Recep Tayyip Erdogan
Recep Tayyip Erdogan won a new five-year term as president in elections in May 2023.
He first came to power as prime minister in 2003 following a sweeping electoral victory the previous year by the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP), of which he was a founding member.
He spent 11 years as Turkey's prime minister before becoming the country's first directly-elected president in August 2014 - a supposedly ceremonial role.
To his supporters he has brought Turkey years of economic growth, but to his critics he is an autocratic leader intolerant of dissent who harshly silences anyone who opposes him.
In July 2016, the AKP government survived an attempted coup which saw clashes on the streets of Istanbul and Ankara that left 256 people dead. 
The authorities subsequently detained thousands of soldiers, judges, teachers and civil servants on suspicion of involvement in the attempt, which President Erdogan said was inspired by his exiled opponent Fethullah Gulen.
A referendum in April 2017 narrowly backed switching to a presidential system of government, which significantly increased his powers. 
Hundreds of private TV and radio stations compete with state broadcaster TRT. However, broadcasting and the press are dominated by pro-government outlets.
Critical news outlets face the risk of being raided or fined. Most arrested journalists are charged with membership in, or propaganda for, groups deemed to be terrorist organisations. 
With mainstream media largely off-limits, independent and opposition voices often rely on social media to share news and opinion.
However, the authorities often impose tough restrictions on social media platforms in order to control information, including by entirely blocking access.
Some key dates in Turkey's history: 
1453 - Sultan Mehmed II captures Constantinople, ending the Byzantine Empire and consolidating Ottoman Empire in Asia Minor and Balkans.
15th-16th Centuries - Ottoman Empire expands into Asia and Africa.
16th-17th Centuries - Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaks,  particularly during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (1520-1566), who personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society, education, taxation and criminal law.
During this period, Ottoman forces are often at odds with the Holy Roman Empire in their advance towards Central Europe through the Balkans and the southern part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
1538, 1571, 1684 and 1717 - Ottoman navy battles for control of the Mediterranean Sea against several Holy Leagues, composed primarily of Habsburg Spain, Genoa, Venice, Knights of Malta, Papal States, Tuscany and Savoy.

16th-20th Centuries - Russo-Turkish wars: a series of 12 wars fought between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Except for the war of 1710-11 and the Crimean War 1853-56, these end in Ottoman defeats.
1750s onwards - Ottoman Empire begins to decline.
1839 - Tanzimat reforms aim to modernise the Ottoman state in line with progress made in Western Europe. 
1876 - These reforms lead to the Ottoman constitutional movement, but the reforms fail to stop the dissolution of the empire.
1908 - Young Turk Revolution forces Sultan Abdul Hamid II to restore the 1876 Ottoman Constitution and recall parliament, which ushers in multi-party politics.
1912-1913 - First Balkan War: the loss of Rumelia, Ottoman territories in Europe, sees the arrival of millions of Muslim refugees in Istanbul and is a major shock to the state.
1913 - Ottoman coup d'état: Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) members make a surprise raid on central Ottoman government buildings and seizes power in the wake of defeat in the war.

Central African Republic country profile,"The Central African Republic (CAR) has been almost continuously unstable since independence from France in 1960. 
It is rich in diamonds, gold, oil and uranium, but has one of the world's poorest populations.
It was plunged into turmoil in 2013 when Muslim rebels from the Seleka umbrella group seized power. A band of mostly Christian militias, called the anti-Balaka, rose up to counter the Seleka.
Seleka handed power to a transitional government in 2014 under international pressure, but the country remains in turmoil.
Critics say President Toudera's government is supported by Russian Wagner Group mercenaries and Rwandan forces in its fight against rebel groups, in exchange for exploiting CAR resources. 
President: Faustin-Archange Touadera
Faustin-Archange Touadera, a former prime minister and maths professor, was declared the winner of a presidential election in February 2016.
He campaigned as a peacemaker who could bridge the religious divide, and won re-election in 2020, but his government controls only part of the country, and rebel groups challenge his authority.
In August 2023, the country's top court approved the outcome of a July referendum, increasing the length of a presidential term to seven years and removing limits on re-election.
The country's main opposition parties and civil society groups had urged a boycott of the vote, saying the changes are designed to keep President Touadéra in power for life.
Reporters and media organisations are caught between armed groups and the authorities. Persistent conflict has hampered media development. Officials and armed groups have targeted journalists and media outlets.
There is little support for independent journalism and media outlets are increasingly aligned with national politicians and foreign governments - especially Russia - says NGO Freedom House.
Radio is the most popular medium. The media consist largely of low-circulation newspapers and ""often-isolated"" radio stations, says Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Some key dates in the history of the Central African Republic:
1880s - France annexes the area, partitions it among commercial concessionaires.
1894 - France sets up a dependency in the area called Ubangi-Chari and partitions it among commercial concessionaires.
1910 - Ubangi-Chari becomes part of the Federation of French Equatorial Africa.
1920-30 - Indigenous Africans stage violent protests against abuses by concessionaires.
1946 - The territory is given its own assembly and representation in the French parliament; Barthelemy Boganda, founder of the pro-independence Social Evolution Movement of Black Africa becomes the first central African to be elected to the French parliament.
1958 - The territory achieves self-government within French Equatorial Africa with Boganda as prime minister.
1959 - Boganda dies.
1960 - The Central African Republic becomes independent with David Dacko as president. He turns it into a one-party state.
1965 - Dacko ousted by the army commander, Jean-Bedel Bokassa, as the country faces bankruptcy and a threatened nationwide strike.
1972 - Bokassa declares himself president for life.
1976 - Bokassa proclaims himself emperor and renames the country the ""Central African Empire"".
1979 - Bokassa ousted in a coup led by David Dacko and backed by French troops after widespread protests in which many school children were arrested and massacred while in detention.
1993 - Ange-Felix Patasse wins presidential elections, ending 12 years of military rule.
2003 - Rebel leader and former army commander Francois Bozize seizes power. 
2012 - New Seleka rebel coalition rapidly overruns north and centre of country, and eventually the capital.
2013 - Seleka rebels overrun the capital and seize power in a coup. President Bozize flees.
With turmoil continuing in the country and rival Muslim and Christian fighters accused of killing hundreds, France steps up its deployment of troops in a bid to disarm the militias. 
2014 - UN Security Council authorises a peacekeeping force of 12,000 troops; UN takes over and augments African Union peacekeeping mission, renamed Minusca.
2015 - Referendum on constitutional changes lead to presidential election.
2017 - Uganda withdraws its forces from CAR where it has been fighting the Lord's Resistance Army for five years.
2020 - President Touadera wins re-election. But with large parts of the CAR controlled by armed groups, the election cannot be carried out in many areas.

Cambodia country profile,"Heir to the ancient Khmer Empire, modern-day Cambodia is now benefiting from relative stability, having endured civil war and the murderous rule of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
Painful memories still endure of the radical communist Khmer Rouge's time in power under the leadership of Pol Pot between 1975 and 1978, when up to  two million people died in the regime's brutal pursuit of a rural utopia.
The economy is dominated by garment-making, but tourism is expanding, and Cambodia hopes to tap into offshore oil and gas reserves and draw in overseas investment to replace aid. 
Corruption is deep-rooted and Cambodia is still one of the world's poorest countries, with most of the workforce still employed in subsistence farming.  
Head of state: King Norodom Sihamoni
King Sihamoni - a trained ballet dancer - became king in October 2004, after his father, the widely venerated and long-serving King Sihanouk, abdicated because of poor health.
Cambodia's kings once enjoyed a semi-divine status; today, the monarch's role is mainly ceremonial.
Prime minister: Hun Manet
Hun Manet, the eldest son of Cambodia's long-term ruler Hun Sen became prime minister in August 2023 after his father earlier announced he would step down after the July 2023 elections -  which critics said was not democratic.
Hun Manet, who until recently was the commander of the Royal Cambodian Army, had long been groomed for the leadership role.
The appointment follows a dynastic succession plan which had been signposted by Hun Sen for several years. 
Many of the men who rose with Hun Sen through the Khmer Rouge revolution and civil war of the 1970s and 80s have also stepped down, in some cases handing their jobs to their own children.
Hun Sen will however retain leadership of the ruling Cambodian People's Party - a position political analysts say still gives him ultimate control.
His rule had become increasingly authoritarian since coming to power in 1985 - making him one of the world's longest-serving leaders - silencing opponents by either jailing or exiling them.
Many Cambodian newspapers and private broadcasters depend on support from political parties. Prime Minister Hun Sen and his allies control several outlets.
Cambodians ""only have access to news provided by major media groups directly linked to Hun Sen"", says media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
Some key events in Cambodia's history:
802-1431 - Khmer Empire centred on Angkor. After the empire's decline, its heartland shifts south to Phnom Penh and becomes modern-day Cambodia.
1863 - Cambodia becomes a French protectorate.
1941 - Prince Norodom Sihanouk becomes king. Cambodia is occupied by Japanese forces during World War Two.
1945 - The Japanese occupation ends.
1946 - France re-imposes colonial rule. A new constitution permits Cambodians to form political parties. Communist guerrillas begin an armed campaign against the French.
1953 - Cambodia wins its independence from France. Under King Sihanouk, it becomes the Kingdom of Cambodia.
1955 - Sihanouk abdicates to pursue a political career. His father becomes king and Sihanouk becomes prime minister.
1960 - Sihanouk's father dies. Sihanouk becomes head of state.
1965 - Sihanouk breaks off relations with the US and allows North Vietnamese forces to set up bases in Cambodia as part of their fight against the US-backed government in South Vietnam.
1969 - The US begins a secret bombing campaign against North Vietnamese forces in Cambodia.
1970 - Prime Minister Lon Nol overthrows Sihanouk in coup and sends the army to fight the North Vietnamese in Cambodia. Over next few years the Cambodian army loses territory against the North Vietnamese and communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas
1975-79 - Communist Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, take power. They institute a brutal totalitarian rule, leading to the deaths of up to two million people, until they are ousted by a Vietnamese invasion.
1981 - The pro-Vietnamese Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party wins elections, but its rule is not internationally recognised. 
1985 - Hun Sen becomes prime minister. Cambodia is plagued by guerrilla warfare. Hundreds of thousands become refugees.
1989 - Vietnamese troops withdraw. Hun Sen tries to attract foreign investment by abandoning socialism. The country is re-named the State of Cambodia. Buddhism is re-established as the state religion.
1991 - A peace agreement is signed in Paris, ushering in a power-sharing administration. Sihanouk becomes head of state.
1993 - The monarchy is restored, Sihanouk becomes king again. The country is re-named the Kingdom of Cambodia.
1997 - Hun Sen mounts a coup against the prime minister, Prince Ranariddh, effectively taking sole power. 
2004 - King Sihanouk abdicates and is succeeded by his son Norodom Sihamoni.
2012 - Cambodia and Thailand withdraw their troops from a disputed border area near the Preah Vihear temple in line with a ruling by the International Court of Justice.
Former king, Norodom Sihanouk, dies of a heart attack. 
2014 -  A UN-backed court in Cambodia sentences two senior Khmer Rouge leaders to life in prison. The two, second-in-command Nuon Chea, and the former head of state Khieu Samphan, are the first top Khmer Rouge figures to be jailed.
2021 - Hun Sen announces his support for his son Hun Manet to succeed him after the next general election in 2023.

South China Sea: Philippines resupplies Spratlys shoal troops,"The Philippines says it has delivered fresh supplies to a remote outpost it claims in the South China Sea.
Manila says Beijing's attempts to ""block, harass, and interfere with the supply mission"" were unsuccessful.
Chinese ships fired water cannon at a Philippine supply mission to the Second Thomas Shoal in the disputed Spratly Islands two weeks before, stopping it from reaching the Filipino troops.
Manila enforces its claim using a decrepit navy ship with a few troops.
China's embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Beijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the Spratlys, which is also claimed in part by the Philippines. 
The sea is a rich fishing ground that is believed to hold vast oil and gas reserves.
Supply missions to the shoal have been a frequent source of friction between the two claimants.
Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also claim parts of the sea, where an estimated $3.37tn or 21% of global trade pass through every year.
Two ships carrying supplies, escorted by two coast guard ships, delivered fresh provisions to Second Thomas Shoal on 22 August, the Philippines' National Task Force on the West Philippine Sea said in a statement.
Manila refers to the portion of the South China Sea that is within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as the West Philippine Sea.
Supply missions to the shoal ""will continue on a regular basis"", the task force said.
The US, the Philippines' treaty ally, has expressed concern over what Manila has described as Beijing's ""dangerous manoeuvres"" in the South China Sea.
Aside from water cannon, Chinese ships also allegedly shone ""military grade lasers"" to temporarily blind the crews of Philippine vessels.
China's repeated attempts to block supply missions to Second Thomas Shoal formed part of the Philippines' winning case before the UN-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague in 2014.
The tribunal ruled that China's claim based on ancient maps is ill-founded. However, Beijing has refused to recognise the ruling and instead built artificial islands on disputed reefs.
After the supply mission in early August was blocked, China's foreign ministry asked the Philippines to remove the ship on Second Thomas Shoal, claiming Manila had ""repeatedly made clear promises to tow away the warship illegally 'stranded' on the reef"". It did not say who made the promise.
Former president Rodrigo Duterte, who served for six years until mid 2022, pivoted Manila's alliances to China and Russia, straining ties with the nation's long-standing ally, Washington.
However his successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, restored security ties with the US and in early 2023 granted American troops wider access to Philippine military bases.
This angered China as a larger US presence in the Philippines provides the missing link to Washington's arc of alliances in the region, stretching from South Korea and Japan to the north to Australia in the South.

Fukushima nuclear disaster: Japan to release treated water in 48 hours,"Japan will start releasing treated radioactive water from the tsunami-hit Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean on Thursday, despite opposition from its neighbours.
The decision comes weeks after the UN's nuclear watchdog approved the plan.
Some 1.34 million tonnes of water - enough to fill 500 Olympic-size pools - have accumulated since the 2011 tsunami destroyed the plant.
The water will be released over 30 years after being filtered and diluted. 
Authorities will request for the plant's operator to ""promptly prepare"" for the disposal to start on 24 August if weather and sea conditions are appropriate, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Tuesday after a Cabinet meeting.
Mr Kishida had visited the plant on Sunday, prompting speculation the release was imminent. 
The government has said that releasing the water is a necessary step in the lengthy and costly process of decommissioning the plant, which sits on the country's east coast, about 220km (137 miles) north-east of the capital Tokyo. 
Japan has been collecting and storing the contaminated water in tanks for more than a decade, but space is running out.

Watch: The BBC's Tokyo correspondent Shaimaa Khalil visits the treatment plant to see how it works
In 2011, a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake flooded three reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The event is regarded as the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.
Shortly after, authorities set up an exclusion zone which continued to be expanded as radiation leaked from the plant, forcing more than 150,000 people to evacuate from the area.
The plan to release water from the plant has caused alarm across Asia and the Pacific since it was approved by the Japanese government two years ago.
It was signed off by the UN's nuclear watchdog in July, with authorities concluding the impact on people and the environment would be negligible. 
But many people, including fishermen in the region, fear that discharging the treated water will affect their livelihoods.
A crowd of protesters in Tokyo on Tuesday also staged a rally outside the prime minister's official residence, urging the government to stop the release.
Plant operators Tepco have been filtering the water to remove more than 60 radioactive substances but the water will not be entirely radiation-free as it will still contain tritium and carbon-14- radioactive isotopes of hydrogen and carbon that cannot be easily removed from water. 
But experts have said they are not a danger unless consumed in large quantities, because they emit very low levels of radiation.
""As long as the discharge is carried out as planned, radiation doses to people will be vanishingly small - more than a thousand times less than doses we all get from natural radiation every year,"" says Prof Jim Smith, who teaches environmental science at the University of Portsmouth.
Experts also note that the contaminated water is being released into a massive body of water, the Pacific Ocean.
""Anything released from the site will therefore be massively diluted,"" says Prof Gerry Thomas, who teaches molecular pathology at the Imperial College London.
Tokyo has previously said the water that will be released into the Pacific Ocean, which has been mixed with seawater, has tritium and carbon 14 levels that meet safety standards.
Nuclear plants around the world regularly release waste water with tritium levels above that of the treated water from Fukushima.
But the plan has caused uproar in neighbouring countries, with China the most vocal opponent. It accused Japan of treating the ocean like its ""private sewer.""
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin reiterated Beijing's objection on Tuesday, adding it would take ""necessary measures to safeguard the marine environment, food safety and public health"".
Japan is ""putting its own self-interest over the long-term well-being of all humankind"" with the release of waste water, Mr Wang said.
Hong Kong said it would ""immediately activate"" import curbs on some Japanese food products.
Both South Korea and China have already banned fish imports from around Fukushima. 
South Korea's government, however, has endorsed the plan, and has accused protesters of scaremongering.

Thaksin Shinawatra: Former Thailand PM jailed after return from exile,"This video can not be played
Watch: Thaksin returns to Thailand after 15 years in exile
Thailand's former PM Thaksin Shinawatra has been jailed upon returning to the country after 15 years in exile. 
But many believe he has struck a deal that will keep him from serving more than a short period in prison.
He arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday morning in a private jet, hours before his Pheu Thai party's candidate Srettha Thavisin was voted the next Thai PM. 
This cements Pheu Thai's coalition with its former military rivals who deposed the party in 2014 in a coup. 
Mr Thaksin, Thailand's most successful elected leader, has long been feared by conservative royalists, who have backed military coups and contentious court cases to weaken him. He went into self-imposed exile in 2008 after being deposed by a coup two years earlier. 
While he made no secret of his yearning to be back in Thailand, what kept him away so long was the various criminal cases hanging over him. But now the brash, politically ambitious telecoms tycoon is back - and was almost immediately sentenced to eight years' jail on criminal convictions he says are politically motivated. 
He arrived to cheers from hundreds of loyal ""red shirt"" supporters who had gathered overnight to see him, but he never greeted most of them. 
Samniang Kongpolparn, 63, was among those who had travelled from Surin province in the northeast, the stronghold of Mr Thaksin's party in past decades.
""He's the best prime minister we've ever had. Even though I won't get to see him today, I still wanted to come to show him support,"" she said. ""I'm ok with them reconciling with the pro-military government, or else we're stuck with the senators. We don't want that.""
Flanked by his two daughters and son, Mr Thaksin emerged briefly from the airport terminal and paid his respects to a portrait of the king and queen. The 74-year-old was then taken to the Supreme Court where he was sentenced and then to Bangkok Remand Prison.
It has been speculated that Thaksin will seek a royal pardon, and prison authorities on Tuesday said he would be able to submit a petition from jail immediately. The process can take one to two months.
Prison authorities there say he will be kept in a wing with specific medical equipment, given his advanced age. He will also immediately undergo a 10-day quarantine - the first five days of which he will be confined to his room, authorities said.
Thaksin's political party in the front seat
Mr Srettha's win on Tuesday is the result of a byzantine process which in three months has taken Thailand full circle. 
It began with the heady hopes of a new dawn led by the radical young Move Forward party, which won the most seats in the May election.
Move Forward initially formed a partnership with Pheu Thai but the coalition now includes almost everyone but the reformers, including two parties led by former coup-makers - a deal with its sworn enemies that Pheu Thai vowed it would not do.
Pheu Thai insists the two developments - Mr Thaksin's return and the coalition that voted for a Pheu Thai PM - are unconnected. Few people believe that.
It is true that Pheu Thai's hands have been tied by the unelected senate, a 250-seat constitutional landmine planted in Thailand's political landscape by the military junta which ruled for five years after a 2014 coup. 
And Pheu Thai's bargaining position was weakened by its poorer-than-expected performance in the election, when it lost a lot of support to Move Forward and for the first time was relegated to second place.
The senators, all appointed under the junta, are allowed to join the 500 elected MPs in voting for the new prime minister. Their thinly-disguised remit is to block any party which might threaten the status quo - the nexus of monarchy, military and big business which has dominated decision-making in Thailand for decades. 
Unsurprisingly they refused to back the Move Forward-led coalition with Pheu Thai, despite its commanding majority in the lower house. When it was Pheu Thai's turn to negotiate a new coalition, its need for senate support meant it had to take in some of its former opponents.
However some Pheu Thai politicians argue that the party should have held out for a better deal, by refusing to be in a government with the most hard-line conservative groups. Any minority administration formed without Pheu Thai and Move Forward would quickly collapse, because the senators cannot join normal parliamentary votes on issues like the budget.
But the Pheu Thai leadership was not willing to wait. It even invited the ultra-royalist party United Thai Nation to join the coalition, whose leaders have in the past been virulently critical of the Shinawatra family and their supporters. They were instrumental in ousting the last Pheu Thai government led by Mr Thaksin's sister Yingluck. That these two factions will now sit together in the same government is a mark of how far Thai politics has shifted.
In the end, for the ultra-royalists, the perceived threat posed by Move Forward, and by a younger generation of Thais demanding a conversation about the power and wealth of the monarchy, eclipsed their long feud with the Shinawatra family. 
For the Shinawatras, and Pheu Thai's more conservative, business-minded elements, getting into government again and guaranteeing the deal to bring Mr Thaksin back, have been bigger priorities than worrying about the party's reputation. 
But there are those, even within Pheu Thai, who are horrified by the cynical pragmatism of this deal. 
They are warning that the party will lose even more of its once-passionate grass-roots supporters - and lose, perhaps forever, the dominance it held over electoral politics in Thailand for two decades.

It wasn't clear which way this story was going to go. 
So it was a joy to be able to bring you the news that all eight people - six of them children - were successfully rescued today. I heard cheers behind me in the newsroom when the development was confirmed. 
The relief on the ground - captured in videos of the final rescues - was palpable.
We've focused on the drama of what Pakistan's army called an operation of ""unprecedented difficulty"". But as you'll have seen in some of our later entries, there's been renewed scrutiny of the country's makeshift cable car system - and calls for safety inspections from Pakistan's leaders.
Our live coverage is coming to a close, but you can read our full report here. 
As well as the reporting by our colleagues at BBC Urdu in Pakistan, today's posts were brought to you by Jamie Moreland, Fiona Nimoni, Thomas Mackintosh, Jacqueline Howard, Liv McMahon, Ali Abbas Ahmadi and Jack Burgess in London. The editors were Marita Moloney, Jamie Whitehead, Rob Corp, Dulcie Lee and me.
We'll be drawing this live page to a close soon - but before we go, here's a quick summary of the latest updates from Battagram in Pakistan. 
Following on from those comments from the president, it's worth us mentioning that there is no road infrastructure or basic facilities in Allai: the mountainous area in which today's story unfolded.
As a result, a local resident obtained permission from the city administration to build the cable car, police confirmed to BBC News.
Known to locals as Dolly, the vehicle links the village of Jangri to Batangi, where the local school is located. What would usually be a two-hour walk was reduced to just four minutes in the cable car.
Police said they checked the lift every month, however BBC News has been unable to independently verify this.
In light of today's events, President of Pakistan Arif Alvi has called on his administration to ""conduct a comprehensive survey"" of all cable cars in the country. 
He says the task would ensure the safety of Pakistanis in the future. 
The former PM, Shehbaz Sharif, has also called for cable cards to be ""inspected and repaired urgently"".
More dramatic footage shows children - reportedly the final children - being rescued with the help of a zip line. 
Watch the clip above to see the children reach safety, having been stuck for hours over a ravine in northern Pakistan.
All eight people stuck in the cable car have now been successfully rescued, with one child rescued earlier in the day by military helicopter.
People across Battagram and the world waited anxiously to see what would happen to the eight people trapped inside the cable car. Thankfully, each and every person was brought down to safety after spending hours stranded hundreds of metres in the air. Here’s how the day unfolded:
The UK's high commissioner to Pakistan, Jane Marriott, has paid tribute to ""all those who worked tirelessly"" to rescue the eight people trapped on the cable car. 
She says it's a ""huge relief"" that they're all now ""safely back on the ground"".
Pakistan's army has said that a highly complex and challenging rescue operation in Battagram area has been successfully completed.
A statement released by the army says the Special Services Group (SSG) team safely rescued the people who got trapped in a cable car 600ft (183m) above the ground. 
Pilots from the army and air force demonstrated ""exceptional skill and professionalism"" during the rescue, the army says. Local cable experts also helped.
The statement describes the rescue as ""unique"" and ""an operation of unprecedented difficulty"".
This serves as a reminder of just how high the cable car was left dangling, while rescuers went about their work.
This dramatic video shows the moment one of the final Pakistani students was brought to safety.
The rescue mission was picked up by zip line experts - after a helicopter operation was suspended when darkness fell over the Battagram region.
Anwaar ul Haq Kakar, the acting Pakistani PM, has expressed how ""relieved"" he is to know that all the children have been ""safely and successfully rescued"". 
He adds on X, formerly known as Twitter: ""Great team work by the military, rescue departments, district administration as well as the local people.""
Pakistan's interior ministry says the remaining three people have been rescued from the cable car, meaning the operation has now concluded.
Makeshift cable cars are widely used in eastern Mansehra and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and stretch all the way up to Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan in the north.
With little infrastructure in the area and long-distances between facilities like schools, the cable cars - often thrown together with scrap metal - are born from necessity.
They are built by local communities - mostly illegally, because it is cheaper and there is no alternative infrastructure.
Sometimes they are made of the upper body of a pick-up truck. For example, a Suzuki may be converted into a large cabin used to transport people and cattle. They are then attached to the cable - which can also be made from scrap iron - using ropes.
Though dangerous, people often use them to cross rivers and to shorten the distance needed to travel between valleys in the mountains.
Military helicopters and rescuers have been working all day to free eight people stuck in a cable car dangling over a river bank in a remote area of north-western Pakistan. 
So far, at least two children have been rescued in the operation. 
Here's a quick 90 second recap of what's been happening:
Three more children have been rescued from the suspended cable car, bringing the total number to five, according to Pakistan's army.
Three people remain in the vehicle: one child and two adults.
Farhat Javed
BBC Urdu senior journalist, reporting from Islamabad
I've been speaking to an army officer about this huge rescue operation, now that darkness has fallen.
Efforts are continuing on the ground after army helicopters were stood down for the night.
The army has brought in zip line operators and rescuers from a private company in the Naran region, the officer says.
“These [civilians carrying out rescue operation now] are not normal locals but are the cable and zip line experts who have been brought in on helicopters by [the] army from various areas of [the] northern region to get benefit from their expertise,"" he adds.
Six people, including four children remain trapped in the cable car suspended over a valley in Pakistan's Battagram region.
The cable car is stuck 900ft (275m) above a river, and the valley spans approximately 1 mile (1.6km), proving difficult and dangerous for rescuers.
Night has fallen on Battagram, but there are still several people trapped in the cable car that is dangling above the mountains in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Here's what has happened so far:
As efforts continue in northern Pakistan to rescue the remaining group trapped in the cable car, the country's caretaker prime minister has said he is ""happy with the progress"" being made so far.
""I'm closely monitoring and tracking the rescue efforts in Battagram, KP,""  Anwaar ul Haq Kakar said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
""I am happy that progress is being made, and thanks to the efforts of our army personnel, air force, rescue organizations, district administration and others, students stuck in the chairlift  have started returning to the ground safely.""
He added he will continue to monitor the situation until the operation is completed.
Retired Pakistan army general Talaat Masood says the loss of daylight complicated the helicopter rescue operation, which is why it has been abandoned at night. 
Speaking to the BBC, Masood says it was already a challenge to rescue those trapped in the cable car. The weather can be unpredictable and dangerous, he says, and “it is not easy to rescue anyone from a height like that”.
Instead, Pakistani authorities will now focus on getting a trolley – a smaller cable car – to help the passengers to safety. It will be dangerous transferring the individuals, he says, and will need to be done “with great care”. 
“But it is a lesser challenge than it would have been if it was a helicopter transfer at night”.

Trump says he will be arrested on Thursday in Georgia election case,"Donald Trump has said he plans to turn himself in on Thursday to a court in the state of Georgia to face charges of election interference. 
A judge in Atlanta who is overseeing the former president's case has set bail at $200,000 (£157,000).
The agreement says Mr Trump can remain free pending trial so long as he does not attempt to threaten or intimidate witnesses. 
Mr Trump denies 13 charges, including racketeering and false statements. 
He and the 18 others accused in this case had previously been given until noon on Friday to appear at Fulton County Jail for processing. 
The county sheriff has said they will all be treated like any other defendants, which could mean Mr Trump is fingerprinted and has his mugshot taken.
Before he announced on social media that he would surrender on Thursday, a court filing was released that set out the terms of his bond agreement. 
""The defendant shall perform no act to intimidate any person known to him or her to be a co-defendant or witness in this case or to otherwise obstruct the administration of justice,"" it said.
""The above shall include, but are not limited to, posts on social media or reposts of posts made by another individual on social media,"" the order adds.
It was signed by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is overseeing the case, and lawyers for Mr Trump. 
Later on Monday Mr Trump posted to his social media platform, Truth Social: ""Can you believe it? I'll be going to Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday to be ARRESTED by a Radical Left District Attorney, Fani Willis.""
""She campaigned, and is continuing to campaign, and raise money on, this WITCH HUNT,"" he added. ""This is in strict coordination with crooked Joe Biden's DOJ [Department of Justice].""
Ms Willis has asked the judge to schedule arraignments - in which a defendant is formally charged and enters a guilty or not guilty plea - on 5 September. 
She has also proposed that the trial begin in March. Both the arraignment and trial could be televised.
When Mr Trump does surrender, there will be a lockdown of the surrounding area and barricades have already been erected outside the court.
Mr Trump was charged last week alongside his co-defendants with attempting to subvert the will of the Georgia electorate by meddling in the state's election results following his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
The former president was heard in a phone call pressuring Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find 11,780 votes"" during the ballot count.
The first former or serving US president ever to be indicted, he faces three other criminal cases.
Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and calls the charges politically motivated. 
He is currently leading the Republican race to pick its next White House nominee to challenge the Democratic candidate, probably Mr Biden, in the 2024 presidential election. 
Mr Trump has already said he will skip the first Republican televised debate on Wednesday evening.
""The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,"" Mr Trump said on Truth Social on Sunday. ""I will therefore not be doing the debates.""
Sources close to Mr Trump say he has instead recorded an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. 
State-by-state primaries - in which Republican voters will choose their party's nominee - are due to begin on 15 January 2024.

Could decriminalisation solve Scotland's drug problem?,"The number of people who died due to drug misuse in Scotland last year fell by 279 to the lowest level for five years.
However, Scotland continues to have the worst drug death rate in the UK and the rest of Europe, with narcotics claiming about 90 lives on average every month.
The Scottish government is proposing to decriminalise the possession of drugs for personal use to ""help and support people rather than criminalise and stigmatise them"".
But the UK government, which controls drugs policy, has rejected the plan as dangerous and says it has no intention of giving the Scottish Parliament the power to enact the new policy.
So what is decriminalisation - and would it work?
In setting out their proposals, Scottish National Party (SNP) ministers cited Portugal, which relaxed its drug laws in 2001, as a potential model.
Despite having almost double the population of Scotland - 10.3 million compared with 5.5 million - Portugal has far fewer drug deaths. There were just 74 in 2021 compared with 1,330 in Scotland in the same year - the latest for which comparable data is available - although the rate in Scotland has since fallen.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) makes comparisons using drug deaths of people aged 15-64 years-old. 
On that measure, National Records of Scotland says Scotland had 248 deaths per million people in 2022.
The EMCDDA says Portugal had nine deaths per million in 2020, the most recent year for which figures are available.
Statisticians say there are some methodological differences between the two nations but the figures are broadly comparable.
Portugal's architect of decriminalisation, João Goulão, argues that adopting a similar policy in Scotland could save lives.
""We are dealing with a health condition, with a disease, and we do not criminalise other diseases,"" he tells BBC News.

João Goulão oversees national drugs policy
We meet Dr Goulão in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, at the General Directorate for Intervention on Addictive Behaviours and Dependencies, where he oversees national drugs policy.
Globally, many advocates of drug liberalisation praise the framework which the former GP helped to design.
In Portugal, drug trafficking and dealing remain criminal offences. Possession of up to 10 days' supply for personal use of any drug, including heroin and cocaine, is not criminal - but it is not legal either and is dealt with as an administrative matter.
If a user is detained, and if there is no evidence that they are supplying narcotics, the police can confiscate their drugs and refer them to a Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Use. This is a panel usually made up of a legal expert, a health professional and a social worker.
There is one commission for each of the country's 18 districts. Overseen by Portugal's health, rather than justice, ministry, they try to establish if a drug user is an occasional recreational consumer or someone struggling with addiction.
The panels have a variety of options available to them, including referring the user for treatment or counselling; levying fines for repeat appearances; imposing sanctions such as revoking a driving licence, a gun licence, or the right to practise in a licensed profession; and applying restrictions on visiting certain places or associating with certain people.
However, in around four out of five cases, after a discussion with the user about their drug use, no action is taken.
In the last year for which figures are available, nine out of ten participants were male and 45% were aged between 16 and 24.
The number of people appearing before the commissions rose from 4,850 in 2002 to 11,995 in 2017 before falling back to 6,628 in 2021.
The head of the commissions, Nuno Capaz, says that reflects the changing rate at which police referred users, rather than a shift in drug use.
Dr Goulão says there have been challenges with funding and recruitment of staff in recent years which have made the job of the panels more difficult, but he insists Portugal is in a much better place than it was before decriminalisation.
Then, he says, the nation was in the grip of heroin and HIV epidemics, with drugs deaths running at around 350 per year.
At one point, one per cent of the entire population — some 100,000 people — had used heroin, estimates Dr Goulão.
""It was difficult to find a Portuguese family that had no problems related to drugs,"" he adds.
Illicit drug use had exploded after the overthrow, on 25 April 1974, of the right-wing Estado Novo (New State) dictatorship, in a peaceful coup which became known as the Carnation Revolution. 
The restoration of democracy saw a closed, conservative and Catholic country rapidly opening up to the world.
It also led to the return of tens of thousands of Portuguese soldiers who had been fighting to retain colonies in Angola, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique.

Luis Miguel Pereira is HIV-positive and addicted to cocaine and heroin
Luis Miguel Pereira recalls how, as the troops came home, drugs flooded into the country.
He started using at the age of 14, he says. Nearly four decades later, he is HIV-positive and remains hooked on cocaine and heroin.
""I need it,"" he says, simply.
As a child, Mr Pereira says, he had a good life, studying and playing football, ""but when I start to take drugs, everything changes.""
""It's like a prison,"" he says. ""You are locked inside of the drugs. You wake up thinking drugs. You lay down thinking drugs. It's the only thought that you think in your mind.""
By the late 1990s the left-wing government of António Guterres - who is now Secretary-General of the United Nations - had begun to take steps towards liberalisation. In November 2000, it passed law number 30/2000, which enacted decriminalisation from 1 July 2001.
""The initial impact was amazing,"" says Rui Moreira, who was running a nightclub at the time but is now the independent mayor of Porto. ""It was great.""
""It was very influential. We were giving them methadone. We were supplying them with medical help. We started controlling HIV. We started distributing free syringes through pharmacies.""
These days the most obvious embodiment of this 'harm reduction' approach are Portugal's two drug consumption rooms, one in Porto which opened exactly one year ago, the other in Lisbon, which has been running since 2021.
In the Porto centre, co-ordinator Diana Castro explains that nurses, a psychologist, a social worker and a doctor are on hand to assist and advise users.
In just nine months, she says, it has helped 1,600 people.
""Every day we are saving lives,"" she added.
The mayor of Porto supports the facility and remains in favour of decriminalisation, but he tells us that he also has concerns.
Time, says Mr Moreira, has revealed some nasty side effects of law 30/2000.
First, he argues, it normalised dangerous drug use among young people, entrenching criminal behaviour by those desperate to feed their addiction and supporting profits for drug dealers.
And as hard drugs began to lose their stigma, users could even be seen shooting up outside schools - where it was forbidden to advertise ice cream or sweets, he adds.
These side effects are not everywhere, by any means. Many parts of this industrial powerhouse turned tourist hotspot on the Douro estuary are bright, clean and bustling with visitors.
But look for evidence of drug taking in Portugal's second city, and you can certainly find it.
Outside São Bento railway station, in the historic centre of this Unesco World Heritage site, syringes lie discarded on the cobbles.
A short drive away, a group of drug users, stripped to the waist, huddle in the shade under a public stairway.
And in Porto's noisy margins, under the flight path of Francisco Sá Carneiro airport, the atmosphere outside the drug consumption room in the neighbourhood of Pasteleira is edgy, as Tony prepares to smoke crack cocaine.
""I'm here every day,"" he tells me, in his native Portuguese.
Tony's aquiline features and grey curls lend him the air of a senator in Ancient Rome.
But given that Tony, 61, says he has been taking drugs for 40 years, perhaps his most remarkable feature is a beating heart.
""I only do coke,"" he says but then adds: ""I take methadone. And I only take heroin when I run out of methadone.""
""Even if the law decriminalises consumption… the police are very aggressive with us,"" adds Tony.
""We're treated like garbage. It's not fair.""
Not long after chatting to Tony outside the facility, our guide tells us abruptly that we must leave.
A look-out has apparently summoned a more senior member of a drug trafficking gang and Pasteleira is no longer considered safe for us or for those with us.
We return to the area a few hours later, accompanied by Porto's municipal police chief, Superintendent Antonio da Silva. He takes us to a rabbit warren of a housing scheme, its high walls crisscrossed by shaded alleyways.
A few months ago, says Mr da Silva, standing here would not have been possible.
""This was a stronghold of drug dealing in Porto,"" he explains, describing it as a ""complete nightmare"" full of dealers and users.
Faced with angry residents who felt trapped in their own homes, the national police moved in and cleared out the criminals.
Drug trafficking is a ""big problem"" in Portugal says Commander Rui Mendes, head of Porto CID at the national police force, which carried out the operation.
""The traffic dealers are very well organised,"" he adds.
""You can make 500 arrests but sometimes I feel you can do a thousand and it would be the same because the profits are too high for them,"" says Mr Mendes.
Mr da Silva supports decriminalisation but he agrees that the fight is never ending. Asked if the operation in Pasteleira simply pushed the problem elsewhere, he replies: ""Definitely.""
""We can make arrests,"" he adds, but ""the police will not solve the social problem of drug addiction.""
The drug consumption room in Lisbon, like its counterpart in Porto, is also under a noisy flight path on the margins of the city, with drug users sheltering from the blazing sun beside a dual carriageway, barely visible in shadows cast by concrete and steel.
Roberta Reis, who runs it, agrees with Mr da Silva that decriminalisation has worked. ""A history of success,"" is how she describes the policy.
Ms Reis says harm reduction has led to a fall in cases of hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis, and HIV.
""You can educate people to use [drugs] in a safer way,"" she adds.
This is a common view here. Decriminalisation feels settled in Portugal. There is no mainstream call for the policy to be reversed.
The mayor of Porto, Rui Moreira, does want changes though. As well as improving housing, cleaning up public spaces, and offering more opportunities for young people, he is calling for criminalisation of drug use in certain areas, such as near schools and civic centres.
There are limits to the comparisons between Portugal and Scotland. No two countries are the same. Scotland has a particularly acute problem with benzodiazepines.
The outgoing chief constable of Police Scotland, Sir Iain Livingstone, recently told Today on BBC Radio 4, that officers had, in effect, been operating a de facto decriminalisation policy.
""For many years now, those that use drugs and addicts have not been subject to criminal sanctions,"" he said.
""My greater concern,"" added Sir Iain, ""rather than the decriminalisation of drugs, is actually making sure there's enough support services.""
On that point at least there appears to be some agreement.
Antonio da Silva recalls being ""absolutely shocked"" by Scotland's death rate.
""Scotland is by far the worst… It's something that should make us think about what is going wrong there,"" he says.
""Must do something,"" agrees João Goulão, although he has a word of caution for policymakers in Edinburgh and London.
""Decriminalisation by itself gives you nothing,"" he warns, ""but all the health responses — treatment, harm reduction — are much more efficient within a decriminalised environment than they were before.""

Netherlands country profile,"The Netherlands' name reflects its low-lying topography, with more than a quarter of its total area under sea level.
Now a constitutional monarchy, the country began its independent life as a republic in the 16th Century, during a long struggle with Hapsburg Spain, when the foundations were laid for it to become one of the world's foremost maritime trading nations.
Although traditionally among the keener advocates of the European Union, Dutch voters echoed those in France by spurning the proposed EU constitution in a 2005 referendum.
The Netherlands has produced many of the world's most famous artists from Rembrandt and Vermeer in the 17th Century to Van Gogh in the 19th and Mondrian in the 20th. It attracts visitors from across the globe.
Head of state: King Willem-Alexander
King Willem-Alexander became the first Dutch male monarch in more than a century in April 2013 when his mother Beatrix abdicated to end a 33-year reign.
The generational change in the House of Orange-Nassau gave the Netherlands a moment of celebration and pageantry at a time of recession brought on by the European economic crisis.
The much-loved Beatrix ended her reign in a nationally televised signing ceremony as thousands of orange-clad people cheered outside. Her retirement followed in the tradition of her mother and grandmother.
Prime minister: Mark Rutte
Prime Minister Mark Rutte is heading a caretaker administration pending elections in November, after announcing his government's resignation in July 2023 when his coalition failed to agree on how to handle increasing migration.
After nearly 13 years in power, Mr Rutte has been  one of Europe's longest-serving leaders. He has said he will not run for a fifth term in office and will leave politics following the elections.
The Netherlands has had a coalition government led by Mr Rutte and his conservative VVD party for the past year and a half, but the four parties involved have been split on migration for some time.
The VVD had been trying to limit the flow of asylum seekers, following a row in 2022 about overcrowded migration centres. His plans were opposed by junior coalition partners. 
The Dutch approach to public broadcasting is unique. Programmes are made by groups which reflect political or religious currents, or other interests. These organisations are allocated airtime on TV and radio, in line with the number of members they have.
Public radio and TV face stiff competition from commercial stations. Viewers have access to a wide range of domestic and foreign channels, thanks mainly to one of the highest cable take-up rates in Europe. Every province has at least one local public TV channel. The three national public TV stations enjoy high audience shares.
Some key dates in the history of the Netherlands: 
1396-1467 - Most of what is now the Netherlands and Belgium is  eventually united by the Duke of Burgundy, Phillip the Good.
1477 - Region increasingly comes under Hapsburg control.
1500-1558 - Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria, King of Spain and Lord of the Netherlands as titular Duke of Burgundy. Born in Ghent he turned rule of the region over to his Spanish relatives.
16th Century - The Protestant Reformation rapidly gains ground in the Netherlands and much of northern Europe. But Charles V and later Philip II consider it a threat to the political system.
c.1566-1648 - The Eighty Years' War or Dutch Revolt. Amid growing resistance to centralised Hapsburg rule, Philip II sends in troops to  crush the rebellion and make all the Netherlands Catholic once more. 
Spanish troops reconquer the southern Netherlands, now Belgium, but fail to completely suppress the rebels.
1579 - Protestant-dominated Dutch Republic established.
1609-1621 - Twelve Years' Truce: facing military stalemate and increasing financial costs, both sides agree to a halt to the fighting.
1621-1648 - Fighting resumes as part of the wider European Thirty Years' War. In 1648 Spain recognises the Dutch Republic, while retaining the southern Netherlands, in the Peace of Münster, part of the Peace of Westphalia.
1652-1674 - As major rivals in world trade and naval power, the Dutch Republic and England fight three naval wars in the 17th Century. 
1672 - The ""Disaster Year"" for the Dutch Republic. England declares war (the Third Anglo-Dutch War), followed by France, Münster and Cologne - which then invade. The country's leader, Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis are lynched and a William III is appointed the country's ruler.
1688 - William III invades England at the invitation of Protestant British nobles feuding with the Catholic James II. This leads to the ""Glorious Revolution"" confirming the principle of parliamentary rule and Protestant ascendency in England.
William becomes co-monarch with his wife Mary, James' eldest daughter. This secures England as a critical financial and military ally in the Republic's long-standing wars with Louis XIV of France. 
1785-1815 - French-Batavian period: The French Revolution sees first a pro-French Batavian Republic, then the Kingdom of Holland, ruled by a member of the House of Bonaparte, and finally annexation by the French Empire. 
1815 - Modern Kingdom of the Netherlands, which includes what is now Belgium and Luxembourg, emerges after the defeat of Napoleonic France. 
1830 - Belgium secedes from the Netherlands.
1839 - Netherlands recognises Belgian independence in the Treaty of London. Luxembourg became a fully independent country.
1914-1918 - The Netherlands maintains its neutrality during World War One. 
1932 - A 31km dam is completed across the Zuider Zee forming a freshwater lake known as the Ijsselmeer. Part of the lake has since been drained and the reclaimed land used to grow crops.
1940 - Nazi Germany invades. The Dutch Royal Family flees to England, accompanied by the Dutch cabinet. The Dutch army is overwhelmed and the Netherlands surrenders.
1944 - As Allied forces advance towards Germany, the Netherlands becomes the site of bitter fighting. 
1945 - The occupation ends with the surrender of German forces in the Netherlands. The Netherlands goes on to become a charter member of the United Nations. 
1948 - Benelux customs union between Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands comes into effect.
1949 - The Dutch East Indies, which had been occupied by Japan during World War Two, becomes independent as Indonesia after a four-year independence struggle against Dutch colonial authorities.
1949 - The Netherlands abandons its policy of neutrality and joins Nato.
1952 - The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Coal and Steel Community, which becomes the European Economic Community five years later in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome.
1963 - Colony of Netherlands New Guinea is ceded to Indonesia.
1975 - Dutch colony of Surinam achieves independence. Hundreds of thousands of Surinamese emigrate to the Netherlands.
1980 - Queen Juliana abdicates; Beatrix becomes queen.
2002 - The Netherlands adopts the euro.

North Korea airline flies first international flight since Covid,"North Korea's flagship carrier has flown its first international flight since the pandemic. 
Air Koryo's JS151 left Pyongyang Tuesday morning and landed at Beijing Capital Airport at 09:16 local time (01:16 GMT), data from real-time flight tracking service Flightradar24 showed.
It is unclear who was on board or how many passengers JS151 was carrying.
Travel agency Koryo Tours said the Pyongyang-Beijing route was reopened as a means for North Koreans to get home. 
According to Flightradar24, flight JS151 was flown on a Tupolev Tu-204 aircraft, which can carry up to 210 passengers. 
It is unclear how many passengers were on board the return flight, JS152, scheduled to depart for Pyongyang from the Chinese capital at 13:05.
But Kyodo News reported that Air Koryo's check-in counter at Beijing airport was packed with passengers wearing North Korean flag pins on their chests and pushing trolleys full of baggage.
On Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry said it had approved the resumption of Air Koryo flights to Beijing, more than three and a half years after they were halted due to Covid border closures. 
Pyongyang has only recently resumed limited international passenger travel.
Last week, a group of North Korean athletes crossed the border into China, on their way to the Taekwondo world championships in neighbouring Kazakhstan.
Russian and Chinese delegations were also in the North Korean capital in July to mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean War armistice, the first known foreign groups to be invited to the country since 2020.

Bosnia-Herzegovina country profile,"Bosnia-Herzegovina is an independent state which is partially under international oversight under the terms of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords which ended the 1992-95 Bosnian war and the break-up of Yugoslavia.
More than 100,000 people were killed and around two million displaced in the war, which also left the infrastructure and economy in tatters.
Its three main communities are Bosniak Muslims, Croats and Serbs. 
The country comprises two autonomous entities - the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska - and the Brcko District, which is governed by its own local government. These come under a federal government and rotating presidency.
Peace has not brought the two entities closer together, and Bosnian Serb leaders often raise the possibility of seceding from what they call a failed state. 
Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Zeljko Komsic
Zeljko Komsic, has been the incumbent sine July 2023.
The chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the presiding member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which collectively serves as the country's head of state.
The chair rotates every eight months between a Serb, a Muslim, and a Croat. The responsibilities of the presidency lie largely in international affairs. In addition, the Muslim-Croat entity and the Bosnian Serb Republic each have their own presidents.
The three members elected at any one election serve a collective four-year term.
Ethnic divisions and the differences between the entities that make up Bosnia are evident in the media scene, and outlets run by the individual entities are more popular than the state-wide public broadcaster.
TV is the most popular medium. The sector is saturated and commercial outlets operate within a weak advertising market.
Around 80% of Bosnians are online. Facebook is the top social media resource.
Some key dates in the history of Bosnia-Herzegovina:
1908 - Ottoman province of Bosnia-Herzegovina annexed by Austria-Hungary.
1914 - A Bosnian Serb student, Gavrilo Princip, assassinates the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. This precipitates World War One.
1918 - Austria-Hungary collapses at the end of the war. Bosnia-Herzegovina becomes part of the future Yugoslavia.
1941 - Bosnia-Herzegovina annexed by pro-Hitler Croatian puppet state. Thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies are sent to the death camps.
1945 - Bosnia-Herzegovina liberated following campaign by Communist partisans.
1945-1991- Bosnia is part of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
1992 - Following collapse of communism, Croat and Muslim nationalists form tactical alliance and outvote Serbs at independence referendum. 
1992-1995 - Bitter ethnically-rooted civil war involving Bosnian Muslims, Serbs, and Croats. Serbs quickly assume control of over half the republic. Killings and deportations are rampant in the newly-proclaimed Serb Republic, but also widespread in Muslim and Croat-controlled areas.
1995 - Safe haven of Srebrenica is overrun by Bosnian Serb forces under General Ratko Mladic, who massacre over 8,000 Muslims.
1995 December - Dayton Peace Accord creates two entities, one for Serbs and one for Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The Office of the High Representative is created to oversee its implementation. An international peacekeeping force is deployed.
2016 - Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is convicted of genocide and war crimes for his role in the war.
Bosnia formally applies for EU membership.
2017 - Former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic is found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity during the Bosnian War. He is sentenced to life imprisonment.
2021  - Serb nationalist leader Milorad Dodik announces the RS will withdraw from Bosnia's military, its top judiciary body and tax administration, prompting renewed fears of a secession crisis.

Kelowna wildfires: Cooler weather brings hope as firefighters make progress,"This video can not be played
Watch: Drone footage shows town incinerated by wildfires
Wildfires raging across Canada's British Columbia have shown some signs of easing, but blazes from hundreds more have driven out more than 30,000 people from their homes.
Officials said firefighters have made some progress aided by cooler weather but the ""battle is not over"".
The government is deploying military to help with evacuations in the province.
Smoke blanketing southern British Columbia and Washington state in the US has also prompted air quality warnings.
No deaths have yet been reported in Canada, but officials say some firefighters are continuing to work even after discovering that they have lost their homes to the fires. 
West Kelowna Fire Chief Jason Brolund said on Monday that firefighters have now entered the Upper Bear Creek Road neighbourhood, an area where wildfire burned the hottest. 
""What they found was that a hurricane had passed through. Trees were ripped out by their roots, and the force it takes to do that is incredible,"" he told reporters.
""Our biggest challenge has been air quality,"" he added. ""It is choking."" 
The lack of visibility due to smoke has made assessing the damages difficult, officials say. 
He said that about 50 structures have burned in West Kelowna, but that the most damaged areas have yet to be surveyed. 
The air around Kelowna was still hazy and the smell of smoke was still present, said the BBC's Wyre Davies who arrived there on Monday night.
Kelowna fire chief Travis Whiting said that his team of 500 or so firefighters have made significant progress over the last four days, with the help of cooler and calmer weather.
""Make no mistake, there will be difficult days ahead,"" Mr Whiting warned on Sunday.
As of Sunday afternoon, the fire covered an area of 410 square kilometres (101,300 acres). 
British Columbia remains under a state of emergency, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Sunday that the military will be deployed to the province to help with evacuations. 
Officials have also restricted non-essential travel to Kelowna and its surrounding areas - a popular destination for tourists in the summer. Officials have praised tourists who have left, vacating hotel rooms for displaced local residents. 
While it is not known yet how many homes and structures have been lost, officials said the damage is ""significant"", with both the communities of Scotch Creek and Celista near Shuswap Lake devastated by the wildfire. 
The fire department in Scotch Creek was among the buildings that were destroyed. 
Homes and properties in West Kelowna have also been scorched, including the historic Lake Okanagan Resort. 
A 50-person urban search-and-rescue team, dubbed Canada Task Force 1, has been deployed to Kelowna to help assess the damage, officials said. The team includes fire and rescue personnel, as well as police officers, engineers and doctors. 
""Canadians from coast to coast to coast are watching in horror the images of apocalyptic devastation and fires going on in communities that so many of us know and so many of us have friends in,"" Mr Trudeau said on Monday. 
Honey Williams August told the CBC that she lost her two cats, along with her home and garden near Little Shuswap Lake.
""It's going to be hard to go back and see a black earth instead of a green earth,"" Ms August said. 
Smoke blanketing much of southern British Columbia has prompted air quality advisories, with regions like the Eastern Fraser Valley and the Central Okanagan classified as ""very high risk"" on Monday morning by Environment Canada. 
Wildfires continue to rage across Canada, with 1,037 fires burning as of Monday, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC). Around 650 of those are considered out of control.
Fires burning further south in the US state of Washington have triggered a state of emergency and blanketed the region in smoke. Over 185 structures have burned, and two people have died, officials say. No details have been provided for the people that died.
Blazes are also raging in the Northwest Territories with thousands still displaced, though a wildfire threatening the territory's largest city Yellowknife has stalled at 15 km (9 miles) from the city's boundary over the weekend. 
Officials fear that hot weather in the forecast could ramp up danger going into the weekend.
Last week, fires incinerated the small hamlet of Enterprise in the Northwest Territories. 
Although no deaths have been reported in the latest Canadian fires, at least four firefighters have lost their lives during this wildfire season.
Experts say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
Extreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground - which can provide fuel for fires that can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.

"Two Ukrainian drones downed over Moscow region, says Russia","Russia's defence ministry says it has thwarted a Ukrainian drone attack after it downed two drones over the Moscow region.
Two other drones were intercepted over the Bryansk region, north-east of the Ukrainian border, it added.
Flights were temporarily stopped to and from Moscow's airports early on Tuesday, the ministry said.
Airspace above Moscow has been closed several times in recent days as reports of drone strikes become more regular.
The defence ministry also said a Russian warplane had destroyed a Ukrainian reconnaissance boat in the Black Sea that had sailed near Russian gas production facilities.
Early on Tuesday, Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Russian air defences had shot down two drones to the west of the capital in the Krasnogorsk and Chastsy districts.
No injuries were reported in the attacks and Ukraine has not commented.
Although Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for specific drone strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"".
On Saturday, a flagship Russian long-range bomber was destroyed in a Ukrainian drone strike, according to reports.
Images posted on social media and analysed by BBC Verify show a Tupolev Tu-22 on fire at Soltsy-2 airbase, south of St Petersburg.
Moscow said that a drone was hit by small-arms fire but managed to ""damage"" a plane.
The Russian Tu-22 bomber that was destroyed can travel at twice the speed of sound and has been used extensively by Russia to attack cities in Ukraine.
Moscow's defence ministry said in a statement that an attack by a ""copter-type UAV"" took place at around 10:00 Moscow time (08:00 BST) on Saturday.
It stated the location as ""a military airfield in the Novgorod region"", where Soltsy-2 is situated.
""The UAV was detected by the airfield's observation outpost and was hit with small-arms fire,"" the ministry said.
""One airplane was damaged; there were no casualties as a result of the terrorist act.""
The statement also said a fire which broke out in the airfield parking lot was quickly extinguished.
However, images posted on the social media platform Telegram showed a large fire engulfing a jet with the distinctive nose cone of the Tu-22. BBC Verify analysed the images and believes them to be credible.
Over recent months dozens of fixed-wing unmanned aircraft have attacked Russia's capital. 
Moscow has blamed Kyiv for the attacks. Ukraine rarely takes responsibility for incidents or strikes that take place within Russian territory.

Profile: Thaksin Shinawatra,"Thaksin Shinawatra, one of the most influential - and polarising - characters in Thai politics,is finally home after 15 years of self-imposed exile. 
The 74-year old was greeted by hundreds of cheering supporters as his private jet touched down at Don Muaeng Airport on Tuesday morning, arriving hours before the Thai parliament was to choose a new prime minister.
He was taken to the Supreme Court, which sentenced him to eight years in jail, based on convictions in criminal cases that he says were politically motivated.
He was then taken to jail. 
Despite his absence from Thailand, Thaksin is still a significant figure in the country's politics. 
The Pheu Thai party, now led by his youngest daughter Paetongtarn, 37 will likely play a leading role in the new ruling coalition. 
A telecommunications billionaire, he was the first prime minister in Thailand's history to lead an elected government through a full term in office.
He was enormously popular, especially among the rural poor, but also proved a divisive figure and was deeply unpopular among many of Bangkok's rich elite.
After more than five years in power, he was ousted in a military coup in September 2006, accused of corruption and abuse of power.
Mr Thaksin has been in self-imposed exile since - mostly in London or Dubai. 
He also owned a controlling stake in English Premier League football club Manchester City, which he was forced to sell off in 2008 after his assets were frozen by Thai authorities over allegations of corruption and conflict of interest.
In the 17 years since being unseated in a 2006 military coup, the country has seen 10 prime ministers. But Thaksin has remained very much at the heart of Thailand's political dramas.
Born in 1949 in the northern city of Chiang Mai, Thaksin started his career as a police officer.
In 1973, he received a government scholarship to study for a masters degree in criminal justice in the United States.
When he returned he went into business, and during the late 1980s began building a successful telecommunications empire.
He founded the Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party in 1998, and its rapid emergence transformed the country's politics.
Thaksin swept into office in 2001, soundly defeating the old guard from the Democrat Party.
Poorer voters liked his offers of cheap medical care and debt relief, his nationalist platform and his contempt for the ""Bangkok elite"". 
But big business also liked him for his CEO-style of government and his ""Thaksinomics"" policies, which created a new boom in a country where the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s had begun.
Thaksin also won support for his handling of the tsunami relief effort after the 2004 Indian Ocean disaster, which devastated parts of south-western Thailand.
Other things were not so easy. He had to face the fallout from his government's suppression of news of an outbreak of bird flu, as well as criticism over the violent deaths of more than 2,500 people during a crackdown on drugs in 2003.
Thailand's Corruption Commission found he had failed to declare all of his wealth, and he was also criticised over the government's handling of the upsurge in violence in the largely Muslim south.
Yet each time he faced pressure, Thaksin appeared to ride out the storm, his backing among his key supporters - Thailand's rural voters - apparently unscathed.
It was his family's decision to sell its shares in one of Thailand's biggest telecom groups, Shin Corp, that led to Thaksin's downfall.
The sale, in early 2006, which netted his family and friends $1.9bn, angered many urban Thais, who complained that Thaksin's family had avoided paying tax and passed control of an important national asset to Singaporean investors.
Amid large-scale street demonstrations, Thaksin called a snap general election for April 2006, effectively telling opponents to ""put up or shut up"".
But main opposition parties boycotted the polls and many voters chose to register a ""no vote"".
Faced with the threat of further protests, Thaksin said he would step down. He did for a few weeks, but returned to office in May.
In September that year, following months of political uncertainty, the military seized power while the prime minister was out of the country.
Thaksin relocated to the UK, but shortly after his allies won the first post-coup elections in late 2007, he returned to Thailand.
There he and his family faced a raft of corruption charges - allegations which the former Thai leader probably expected to come to nothing.
But the courts - greatly empowered by a new military-backed constitution - pursued the cases against him and his family with new vigour.
First his wife, Potjaman, and then Thaksin himself were sentenced to jail terms - with the Supreme Court finding the former leader guilty of corruption.
Thaksin left Thailand, failing to return home for a court appearance from the Olympic Games in Beijing in August 2008, and became a fugitive.
Since divorcing his wife - who now lives in Bangkok after her sentence was suspended - he has spent most of his time in Dubai.
Political parties backed by Thaksin and led by his proxies have consistently won elections, but have been unable to hold on to power. 
In 2008, a successor party to Thai Rak Thai was dissolved by the courts in 2008, and in that year two of its prime ministers were also disqualified.
After Thaksin's sister Yingluck won a landslide in the 2011 election, she was disqualified by the courts, and her government ousted by a second coup. She is also living in exile.
At the 2019 election, Pheu Thai won far more seats than any other party, but was prevented from forming a government.
But in May, the progressive Move Forward party stunned observers by winning the most seats in the lower house, well ahead of Pheu Thai. 
Its leader Pita Limjaroenrat's bid to become PM was swiftly ended, as he was suspended from parliament by the constitutional court.
It paved the way for Thaksin's return, as Pheu Thai brokered a power-sharing deal with two military-linked parties.

R Praggnanandhaa: India chess prodigy takes on Magnus Carlsen in World Cup final,"Indian chess fans are delighted as the country's R Praggnanandhaa is set to take on No. 1 ranked Magnus Carlsen in the World Cup final.
Praggnanandhaa, 18, had defeated World No. 3 Fabiano Caruana in a tie-breaker on Monday to advance to the finals.
Carlsen had reached the final over the weekend after defeating Nijat Abasov.
This is the first time that Carlsen, 32, will play in the final of the World Cup, held by the International Chess Federation (FIDE).
The final match will begin on Tuesday at Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
Praggnanandhaa, who turned 18 earlier this month, is the youngest to play in the World Cup final. 
The teenager has also become the third-youngest person in the world to qualify for the Candidates Tournament, which will be held next year to determine the challenger for the world champion title. Both Carlsen and US chess genius Bobby Fischer had qualified for the tournament when they were 16 years old.
Praggnanandhaa - popularly known as Pragg - is one of India's most promising chess players. 
He was just 10 years old when he became the youngest International Master in the history of the game. Two years later, in 2018, he became the world's then second-youngest chess grandmaster.
Last year, he defeated Carlsen at the Airthings Masters, an online rapid tournament, becoming only the third Indian to defeat the Norwegian grandmaster.
He's also the first Indian since chess legend Vishwanathan Anand to make it to the final of the FIDE World Cup.
On Tuesday, Anand led the celebrations after Praggnanandhaa's victory with a post on X, saying ""What a performance!""
Former World champions Susan Polgar and Garry Kasparov also congratulated the teenager on social media.
Reacting to his win on Monday, Praggnanandhaa said that he hadn't expected to play against Carlsen in the tournament because ""the only way I could play him was in the final, and I didn't expect to be in the final"".
""I will just try to give my best and see how it goes,"" he said.

Could Portugal's drug laws help solve Scotland's problems?,"This video can not be played
Scotland has the highest drugs death rate in Europe, with narcotics claiming more than 100 lives on average every month.
The Scottish government is proposing to decriminalise the possession of drugs for personal use, to ""help and support people rather than criminalise and stigmatise them"".
But the UK government, which controls drugs policy, has rejected the plan as dangerous and says it has no intention of giving the Scottish Parliament the power to enact the new policy.
In setting out their proposals, SNP ministers cited Portugal, which relaxed its drug laws in 2001, as a potential model.
Despite having almost double the population of Scotland - 10.3 million compared to 5.5 million - Portugal has far fewer drug deaths. There were just 74 in 2021 compared with 1,330 in Scotland, where the figures for 2022 are set to be published on Tuesday.
Portugal’s architect of decriminalisation, Dr João Goulão, argues that a similar policy could save lives in Scotland.
""We are dealing with a health condition, with a disease, and we do not criminalise other diseases,"" he tells BBC News.

Ukraine war: The men who don't want to fight,"Ukraine is struggling to meet its demand for soldiers. 
Volunteers aren't enough. The country constantly needs to replace the tens of thousands who've been killed or injured. Many more are just exhausted, after 18 months fighting off Russia's full-scale invasion. 
Some men though don't want to fight. Thousands have left the country, sometimes after bribing officials, and others are finding ways of dodging recruitment officers, who in turn have been accused of increasingly heavy-handed tactics. 
""The system is very outdated,"" says Yehor. He watched his father suffer from mental health issues after fighting with the Soviet Army in Afghanistan.  
It's why he doesn't want to fight. He's asked that we don't use his real name to protect his identity.  
Typically, before Russia's invasion, men who didn't want to do military service because of their religious beliefs would be offered an alternative - like working in farming or social services.
That choice disappeared with the start of martial law last year, but Yehor thinks it should still be available, regardless of peoples' reasons.
""Each situation is individual,"" argues Yehor. ""The fact it is written in the constitution that all male citizens must fight is, in my opinion, not in line with today's values.""
He was recently sent to a recruitment centre after being stopped by police in Kyiv, who accused him of avoiding the draft. He was eventually allowed to go home, after pleading that he had back problems, but next time he fears he won't be. 
There are exemptions from service, including having poor health, being a single parent, and caring for someone vulnerable. But those convicted of draft-dodging face fines, or even up to three years in prison. 
""Everyone should be allowed to contribute to this war if their situations are taken into account,"" says Yehor. ""I feel sorry for people who are on the front lines, yet I don't have a pacifist alternative."" 
The way Kyiv conscripts men has been accused of being corrupt at its core. 
President Volodymyr Zelensky has sacked every regional head of recruitment in Ukraine after widespread allegations against officers in the system, including bribe-taking and intimidation. 
The family of one military draft chief in Odesa were even accused recently of buying cars and property on Spain's southern coast costing millions of dollars. The officer reportedly denies any knowledge of this. 
Defence officials have told the BBC the alleged offences are ""shameful and unacceptable"". 
Mobilisation is why most men under 60 can't leave Ukraine. Thousands often try to sneak out of the country, mostly across the Carpathian mountains to Romania. 
For those who stay, mass group chats help them avoid being drafted. Telegram threads give tip-offs on where drafting officers are patrolling. There are chats for different regions and cities across the country, sometimes with more than 100,000 members each. 
The officers in these groups are known as Olives, because of the colour of their uniforms. People they encounter are typically handed notices ordering them to register at a recruitment centre, but there are reports of some being taken away on the spot, without a chance to return home. 
Ukraine's Defence Ministry urges people to keep their details updated on a national database, and says that if they are called up they'll be sent to a suitable posting. 
But there are claims of officers using harsh or intimidating tactics. There are also reports of conscripts finding themselves on the front line with just a month of training. 
The authorities do seem keen to restore confidence. 
""It's OK to be afraid,"" is the slogan of their latest information campaign. It's an attempt to draw parallels between childhood fears and the worries of today. 
In an abandoned summer camp in Kyiv, civilians are trained in resisting Russian soldiers, in case of need. They patrol the paths before an instructor shouts, ""Second group! Grenade!"" The men and women quickly fling themselves on the ground. 
Their rifles are not real, but there's a hope some participants will sign up for the real thing. Anton, a 22-year-old student, has already made up his mind. 
""When the war started, I wasn't ready to get drafted,"" he tells me during a break from rolling in the grass. 
""Now I have to get prepared to go to war in the future."" 
Anton doesn't think it's good that people avoid the draft, but he understands why someone wouldn't want to fight. 
I ask him if he's scared of the prospect. 
""Of course,"" he replies, almost cutting me off. ""Everyone is scared. But if the situation gets any worse, there's no way I'll be sitting here in Kyiv."" 
Ukraine has defied all expectations in its defence against Russia's full-scale invasion. 
Moscow's focus has been forced to shift from taking the whole country to trying to hang on to a fifth of it. 
But Ukraine is having to do its own recalibrations. 
Not just with its own counteroffensive, which is bringing progress slower than many hoped, but also with how it motivates its citizens to fight. 
There is an undeniable need, but also an uncomfortable truth, in the battlefield not being for everyone.

Storm Hilary: Flooding cuts off Palm Springs in California,"This video can not be played
Watch: Storm Hilary...the past 48 hours in 100 seconds
Hilary, the first tropical storm to hit southern California in 84 years, cut off the desert city of Palm Springs after dumping a year's worth of rain. 
Major roads in and out of Palm Springs were temporarily closed on Monday by flooding after it was drenched with 3.18in (8cm) of rain.
Rescuers had to save several people there from swollen rivers. 
Hilary, now a post-tropical cyclone, could still bring flooding to parts of Nevada, Oregon and Idaho. 
The storm made landfall in the northern part of Mexico's Baja California peninsula on Sunday morning. 
It quickly crossed the border into the US. Death Valley National Park received a full year's worth of rain in one day, and remains indefinitely closed. 
The storm broke single day rainfall for San Diego, Palm Springs and several other California cities, according to the National Weather Service. 
Emergency 911 lines went down in Palm Springs, which is about 110 miles (175km) east of Los Angeles, as well as in nearby Cathedral City and Indio, according to officials. 
""Right now we have flooding on all of our roads. There's no way in or out of Palm Springs and that's the case for the majority of the Coachella valley. We're all stuck,"" said Palm Springs Mayor Grace Garner in an interview with CNN on Monday. 
""This is a very extreme situation at the moment.""
Interstate 10 through Palm Springs - which had been closed in both directions - reopened later on Monday.
During the heaviest rains on Sunday, many Palm Springs residents spent hours sweeping water away from doorways to prevent their homes from flooding, resident Sean Heslin told the BBC.
Just outside of Palm Springs, in Cathedral City, 14 people were trapped in an old people's home as flooding and mud cut off exits. Firefighters rescued them by Monday afternoon. 
Fifty mobile homes were under water in the city and firefighters had to rescue four adults. 
Schools were closed on Monday, including in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the country, because of concerns about driving conditions. 
As Californians battened down the hatches for the storm another natural disaster - a magnitude 5.1 earthquake - hit north-west of Los Angeles on Sunday, though without causing major damage.
About 30,000 people in the state were without power as of Monday evening local time after the storm, according to poweroutage.us. 
No deaths, serious injuries or major damage have been reported in the US from Hilary.
But one man died in a car in a flash flood in Mexico on Sunday. The Baja California peninsula saw heavy rain and winds of 70mph on Sunday. 
The last time a tropical storm made landfall in Southern California was in Long Beach in 1939. 
Experts say recent abnormal weather events that have plagued the US - and several areas across the globe - have been influenced by human-caused climate change.

Biden tours 'overwhelming' Hawaii wildfire damage,"This video can not be played
Watch: 'We will rebuild the way people of Maui want to'
President Joe Biden has toured wildfire damage in Hawaii after scrutiny of his administration's response to the state's worst ever natural disaster.
He arrived in Maui on Monday, 13 days after the deadliest US wildfire in over a century, telling survivors the nation ""grieves with you"". 
Mr Biden and First Lady Jill Biden toured the charred ruins of the town of Lahaina and met first responders. 
At least 114 people have died and 850 people are still missing. 
Hawaii's governor has said many of the victims may be children. 
""For as long as it takes, we're going to be with you,"" said Mr Biden, who spoke for about 10 minutes amid the rubble. ""The whole country will be with you."" 
He added: ""The country grieves with you, stands with you and will do everything possible to help you recover.""
Mr Biden - who also took an aerial tour - described the wildfire devastation as ""overwhelming"".
The president and the federal agencies he oversees have come under fire from Hawaiians who say aid has been inadequate and poorly organised.
Republicans have led criticism of the Democratic president for having been on two holidays since the fire struck on 8 August. 
To visit Hawaii, Mr Biden paused his current vacation at Lake Tahoe in Nevada, where he is renting a home belonging to a Democratic donor, according to the White House.
This video can not be played
""There's a lack of response, it felt like""
When asked about the rising death toll on 13 August while he was at a Delaware beach, Mr Biden angered some Hawaiians by saying: ""No comment"".
The White House has said Mr Biden delayed his trip to the disaster zone so he wouldn't distract from recovery operations.
The president issued a major disaster declaration on 10 August to expedite federal funding and assistance to the area. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency says more than 1,000 federal responders are now on the ground in Hawaii.
Local officials have also faced criticism. Maui's emergency management chief resigned last week after the agency faced backlash for failing to activate its alarm system in the wake of the fire. 
To date, 27 of the deceased have been identified and 11 families had been notified, Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said earlier on Monday.

Details of who the victims are have begun to emerge in recent days - they include an avid musician, and loving grandmothers and fathers. 
Mr Bissen said that in some respects, the figure of 850 missing was ""positive news"" because it marked a decrease from the more than 2,000 unaccounted for in the immediate aftermath of the fires.
Family members of the missing have been asked to provide a DNA sample to assist in the recovery search. 
Experts have told the BBC both finding and identifying the victims could take months or even years given the magnitude of the destruction and the condition that many of the remains are likely to be found in.

Katty Kay: Why bad news is good news for Trump - for now,"America's election cycle is topsy-turvy. What would normally be down is up - at least as far as the two main candidates and their popularity goes. 
The number of criminal charges against Donald Trump keeps stacking up - but so do his poll numbers in the Republican primary and his pile of campaign money. The former president is defying gravity. The current president, Joe Biden, has the opposite problem - he can't seem to get lift-off. No matter how well the country is performing, he doesn't rise in the polls. 
Biden is presiding over an economy that is the envy of almost every country in the world. Inflation is coming down (at 3% it's less than half what it is in the EU or UK), unemployment is also low (3.5%) and fears of a recession are receding. Americans are still being squeezed by higher interest rates and the prices that remain above pre-Covid levels, but the president is travelling around the US this summer reminding people that key parts of his agenda, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act, have pumped trillions of government dollars into the US economy. 
But Biden doesn't seem to be getting much credit for the economic upswing. A recent Reuters poll shows 54% of Americans disapprove of the job Biden's doing - that's actually a couple of points worse than in March, when a recession looked more likely and inflation was higher. And it's significantly worse than the 32% who disapproved of his record when he was inaugurated in 2021. The economy picks up, his poll numbers head down. Good news isn't good news.  
Part of the problem is that many of Biden's big spending programmes are still in the approvals phase. Administration officials I've spoken to hope that as the money gets dispersed into projects around the country, the regular rules of politics will resume and people will start to see the benefits of what the president has done and reward him for it. That's why the White House dubbed his plan ""Bidenomics"". But there's a risk to that. If inflation goes back up and a recession re-emerges then Republicans will have been given a handy slogan for their negative campaign ads.  
Meanwhile, Donald Trump faces the opposite situation - bad news isn't bad news. 
""If the question before voters is should Trump be in the Jail House or the White House? Trump wins."" That was the text I received from a Trump associate the evening he was indicted in Georgia on charges of interfering in the state's 2020 election.
In normal times the question of jail time wouldn't seem to be great news for a presidential candidate. But here's the same associate's counterintuitive thinking:  ""I can actually sell that a lot easier than 'Biden sucks and doesn't deserve a 2nd term'."" To be clear, this is different from a ""he's innocent"" argument. 
It's pretty stunning that people in Trump's orbit even think this could be a positive thing for them. Stunning but, in this down-is-up world, not entirely surprising. Those strong primary polls, and the campaign donations flowing in suggest that Republican voters like Trump more despite, or perhaps even, because of his legal problems. 
Those on his campaign are betting that voters in decisive areas of the country, like the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, would be so appalled at the idea of sending a former US president to prison that they would vote to elect Trump back into the White House, possibly in the hope that he could get himself out of legal jeopardy.  
But it's too early to know yet if this is how voters will really see it come November 2024. 
Recent polls of the electorate as a whole show a majority of Americans think Trump committed a crime. The majority also says they won't vote for him. 
""I think his staff recognises the danger that he is in right now, but they want to hold sway over the Republican party,"" says Anthony Scaramucci, who was Trump's communications adviser for a brief period when he was president.  
""For this reason they are going to keep him in the campaign for as long as possible, but I do think he eventually drops out as a result of the combination of legal pressure and pressure from his family."" 
This is not the same as saying they are thrilled about Joe Biden. They aren't. Even Democrats question whether he's too old to be running for a second term. 
One thing that is sure about this campaign, is that it will continue to be extraordinary.

Brics summit: How China's and Russia's clout is growing in Africa,"The wealthiest square mile in Africa is hosting a big international summit this week with a mixture of pride, relief, and a hint of unease.
Sandton - a glitzy banking district on the outskirts of South Africa's increasingly dilapidated city of Johannesburg - is the venue for the latest meeting of the Brics group, an ambitious but amorphous bloc of countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), united by a desire to challenge perceived Western dominance in global affairs. Dozens of other nations are queuing up to join.
The current wave of relief felt here in South Africa in relation to Brics can be explained by President Vladimir Putin's recent decision to stay away from the summit. 
Had he insisted on coming, South Africa would have finally had to clarify its position on whether it would carry out its international obligation to arrest Russia's leader for alleged war crimes in Ukraine.
Spared that awkward challenge, South African officials are now revelling in their role as host - proudly filling journalists' inboxes with a flood of emails about Brics breakfast meetings, trade fairs, township dialogues and the like.
This unusual degree of official enthusiasm serves, to some observers, to underline quite how far and fast this country appears to be steering away from the West, not just towards a more multi-polar world, but firmly into China and, to a lesser extent, Russia's orbit.
At a recent pre-summit meeting of Brics foreign ministers in Cape Town, a Russian journalist leant over to me in a news conference and declared: ""You can keep your human rights paradise [in the West]. We are remaking the world.""
Brics may still be in its infancy, but it is generating - at least in some quarters - a genuine and disruptive sense of energy and excitement.
A colleague who attended a foreign policy workshop organised by South Africa's government told me of an overwhelming consensus there that China was the future, and the West was in decline.
Which is where South Africa's unease comes into the equation. 
The country's President Cyril Ramaphosa - a wealthy businessman - will be acutely aware of the fact that the local economy, hit hard by Covid and grappling with the world's highest levels of unemployment and inequality, desperately needs more foreign investment if it is to escape a spiralling crisis.
Russia is certainly not the answer. Its trading relationship with South Africa is almost non-existent. 
China is an increasingly important player but is, nonetheless, overshadowed here by longstanding trade with, and investment from, the European Union (EU) and the US. 
So why would South Africa jeopardise those key Western relationships - already strained - at a time of profound economic uncertainty? 
The answer, at least in part, appears to lie within the country's increasingly weary and erratic governing party.
After three decades in power, the African National Congress (ANC) is struggling to rid itself of infighting, corruption and administrative chaos. 
Confronted with the war in Ukraine, for instance, South Africa's government has offered a muddled grab-bag of responses - first condemning the invasion, then pointedly refusing to condemn it, then blaming Nato, praising Mr Putin, offering itself as a peace broker, hosting Russian naval exercises, rushing to explain itself to Washington, and casually repeating Kremlin talking points. 
Then there is the still lingering mystery of whether South Africa supplied arms to Russia last year - as alleged by the US.
There is little doubt that President Ramaphosa is deeply uneasy about Russia's invasion and anxious to portray himself as a wise and neutral advocate for a more multi-polar world. 
But many in his government and party routinely undermine that stance - often citing nostalgia for Moscow's support during the anti-apartheid struggle and a more general suspicion of US foreign policy. 
The haphazard messaging has managed to irritate all sides in the conflict and succeeded only in making South Africa appear weak and indecisive. 
Nelson Mandela's ""rainbow nation"" is certainly struggling right now - with some even warning that it could soon become a ""failed state"".
But this week's Brics summit will, by contrast, provide the Kremlin with a useful platform to showcase its own, far more strategic and effective diplomacy. 
Recent headlines from the continent may have been dominated by the coup in Niger, and the potential for Russia's thuggish, opportunistic, Wagner Group mercenaries to exploit the chaos for their own benefit, as they have already done in Mali and the Central African Republic (CAR).
But at least as significant is the success with which Moscow, through its hard-travelling Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and through canny media messaging, has managed to present itself - after decades with almost no presence on the continent - as a credible alternative to ""colonial"" Western influence in Africa. 
In countries wrestling with poverty, the impact of climate change, increasingly youthful populations, and growing unemployment, frustration with the status quo has left many people open to new alternatives.
Which begs the question - what have Western nations been doing to challenge Russia? 
It is, of course, dangerous to make generalisations about this continent, and both wrong and offensive to suggest African governments are merely pawns in a reviving Cold War. 
But where is the Western version of Brics? The UK has a ""minister for Africa"" - but almost no-one has ever bothered to stay in the job for more than a year. 
A preoccupation with development projects, strict conditions and cherry-picked foreign invitations for favoured African leaders, has fuelled the claim that France, the UK and other former colonial powers are still treating the continent as a tiresome crisis to be managed, rather than a partner to be supported.
This may be unfair. After all, Western nations have, for decades, devoted significant energy and cash towards supporting health services, businesses and governments across the continent. 
But the role of Western armies - French troops and American drones in particular - in places like Niger and Somalia, has provoked strong backlashes.
Which may help to explain why Brics's alternative vision is gaining traction on this continent, and why the bloc will be making its case, loudly and confidently, in the conference halls of Sandton this week.

Cork: Governing body did not sanction fatal triathlon,"Both men got into difficulty in the swim element of the half Ironman triathlon event at Claycastle beach
At a glance
The governing body for triathlon in Ireland has said it did not sanction a race in which two men died
The men who died were Ivan Chittenden, 64, from Toronto in Canada, and Brendan Wall, who was in his mid-40s and originally from County Meath
Both men got into difficulty in the swim element of the half Ironman triathlon event at Claycastle beach
The organiser of the event, Ironman Ireland, said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths
Triathlon Ireland has said it did not sanction an ironman event in County Cork in which two men died, after officials carried out out a water safety assessment. 
Post-mortem examinations have taken place after Ivan Chittenden and Brendan Wall died while participating in the swim element of the event in Youghal.
Triathlon Ireland, which is the governing body for triathlons in Ireland, said after the safety assessment it told race organisers Ironman Ireland that it could not sanction the race due to ""adverse conditions"".
Mr Chittenden, who was 64, was from Toronto in Canada. 
Mr Wall, who was in his mid-40s, was originally from County Meath and had been living in Solihull in England. 
Both men got into difficulty at Claycastle beach on Sunday.

Ironman Ireland said it was ""reeling"" from the news of the men's deaths.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Ivan’s and Brendan’s loved ones,"" a spokesperson said.
""The triathlon community is a very close community and this loss has had a devastating effect on all of us.""
""As there is an investigation ongoing, at this stage it would not be appropriate for us to make any further comment only to state that Triathlon Ireland will provide any assistance that the authorities require.""
Event organiser Ironman Ireland said it carried out standard checks on Sunday morning before the event and determined water conditions were safe for the race to take place as planned.
It added that because of the weather conditions the swim was shortened to allow ""water safety assets"" including kayaks, lifeguards and medical boats, to be concentrated in a smaller area.
It said the change also allowed swimmers the ability to swim with a more favourable current and incoming tide after the first 100m.
Ironman Ireland added that its ""utmost priority"" is with the safety of all its athletes and all others involved in its events. 
""We are providing ongoing assistance to their families and we will continue to offer them our support as they go through this very difficult time,"" the organisation said.
It said its thoughts were with the family and friends of the men who died.
Gardaí (Irish police) said both men were pronounced dead by medical personnel and they have ruled out any criminal investigation into the deaths.

Phil Harris says conditions were challenging
A triathlete from County Down who competed in the Ironman event said the conditions faced by the swimmers had been ""challenging”.
Phil Harris said the weather changed as the event began but added it was a well organised competition.
 “It was initially difficult once you first got into the water,"" Mr Harris told BBC News NI.
“It wasn’t so bad once you got through the waves and the current was taking you basically to the finish line. But I knew it was going to be challenging looking at it, standing wait to get in. 
“I felt the Ironman as a complete event is really, really well run. It’s a good event. This was my first Ironman so I just assumed this was normal, getting in [the water].""
The triathlon was originally due to take place on Saturday but the schedule was disrupted by severe weather over the weekend.
Storm Betty caused flooding and wind damage in several locations across the island of Ireland on Friday evening.
On Friday afternoon, the organisers said they intended to move Saturday's swim course ""further into Youghal Bay, where the water is more protected"".
However, they later had to postpone the triathlon because the bike course was affected by flooding and storm debris.
On Saturday afternoon, the organisers said the race would go ahead on Sunday after Cork County Council helped to clear the course of debris.
They added that due to ""improving weather conditions"" the swim course would ""revert back to the original course"".
Following the deaths of the two men, Cork County Council said it was currently offering ""every assistance required to the Ironman Group and all those impacted"".
""We wish to express our gratitude to the response agencies involved, including our dedicated fire and emergency personnel for their unwavering efforts during this difficult time,"" it added.
The triathlon event, which also features a full Ironman alongside the 70.3 event, continued on Sunday.
County Cork Mayor Frank O'Flynn said the deaths were a ""tragedy"". He said he was at the finish of the event on Sunday and that many of the athletes were not fully aware of what had happened.
He told Irish broadcaster RTÉ the decision to continue the event ""was a hard one to call"".
""I've no doubt there will be a full investigation and I look forward to the reports on that and that’s something that I ask that they would look at,"" he added.
""Afterwards, I suppose its easier to make the call, but it's a worldwide event, there's quite a lot of organisation that went into it. 
""But at the end of the day, safety is paramount and the fact that they did reduce the length of the swim - it was at that stage they thought that they would make it much safer, because they are very, very conscious of safety.""
Mr O'Flynn said the event is ""very, very well organised"" and he had never seen ""so many stewards"".
Judging the safety of sea conditions is not an exact science and it is clear there was a difference of opinion between officials in County Cork on Sunday.
There were also mixed opinions amongst those taking part. 
One swimmer described the water as “initially rough but ultimately manageable”. 
Another said it was like “being in a washing machine” and too dangerous. 
The deaths of two swimmers in the water has led to many questions, but few answers yet. 
A clearer picture may emerge once the results are released of the post mortem examinations.

"Sara Sharif was bubbly and confident, says school","A 10-year-old girl found dead at home was ""a bubbly girl"" with a beautiful smile, her school has said.
Sara Sharif's body was found at her family home in Woking, Surrey, early on 10 August, prompting a murder inquiry.
Jacquie Chambers, head of St Mary's C of E primary school in Byfleet, said Sara would be ""dearly missed"".
Three people who travelled to Pakistan before her body was found are believed to have gone to Islamabad and are wanted for questioning.
Ms Chambers said: ""She was a bubbly, confident little girl who had the most beautiful smile. She was full of ideas and was very passionate about the things she believed in.""
The head teacher said the pupil had been in Year 5 at the school, adding: ""Sara will be dearly missed and, as a school community, we are all deeply affected by this tragedy. 
""Our thoughts, prayers and sympathy are with those affected by this heart-breaking news.""
Ms Chambers said she could not make further comment due to the police inquiry, but said the school was ""fully supporting partner agencies with their investigations"".
She added: ""Our priority now is to support our school community as they grieve and recover.""
The three people who are wanted by the police are Sara's father, Urfan Sharif, 41, his partner, Beinash Batool, 29, and his brother, Faisal Malik, 28.
BBC News has been told two police teams in Jhelum, north Punjab in Pakistan, are looking for Mr Sharif.
Surrey Police have said Mr Sharif, 41, made a 999 call from Pakistan shortly after landing in Islamabad with his partner, his brother and five children, aged between one and 13.
The call led officers to the house in Woking where they found the body of Sara who had sustained ""multiple and extensive injuries"", likely to have been caused over a sustained period of time. 
There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Pakistan.
Surrey County Council have confirmed that Sara was known to the authorities and a multi-agency review is under way.
Police have also been searching the family's previous address in West Byfleet in Surrey.

Canada wildfires: Trudeau criticises Facebook over news ban amid crisis,"This video can not be played
Watch: Trudeau criticises Meta's decision to block news during wildfire emergency
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has accused Facebook of putting ""profits ahead of people's safety"" after it blocked news amid devastating wildfires in the country.
Facebook banned news on its platform in response to Canadian law forcing it to share profit with news outlets.
Wildfire evacuees have said the ban has impacted their ability to share critical news with each other. 
Meta, Facebook's parent company, calls the law ""fundamentally flawed"".
The prime minister, during a televised news conference on Monday, said the actions of Meta were ""inconceivable"".
The company has blocked news on Facebook and Instagram in Canada since 1 August, after the country's parliament passed an online news bill that requires platforms like Google and Meta to negotiate deals with news publishers for content.
Meta has faced significant criticism from Canadian officials since then. On Saturday, Canada's heritage minister, Pascale St-Onge, said in a post on social media that the company is blocking ""essential information"" for users.
She added that this is being done despite the law - dubbed Bill C-18 or the Online News Act- not going into effect yet. In an earlier post, she called Meta's decision ""reckless"".
Meta has called the law ""fundamentally flawed legislation that ignores the realities of how our platforms work"".
In a statement to the BBC, Meta said the law forces the company ""to end access to news content in order to comply with the legislation"".
It added that it has activated a ""Safety Check"" feature on its platform for people living in evacuated areas. 
This allows users to mark themselves safe and access ""reputable information, including content from official government agencies"", a spokesperson said. 
Evacuees in the Northwest Territories, where a wildfire continues to rage 15 kilometres (9 miles) away from its largest city Yellowknife, said the news ban has made it harder for them to spread life-saving information with their network. 
Delaney Poitras, who has had to evacuate twice in recent weeks from her home in Fort Smith, told the CBC that she has not been able to share things like news conferences from officials or news articles on evacuation updates. 
She adds that Facebook plays a huge role in connecting people in her community. ""It's how we all keep in touch,"" she said.
Data suggests that about 77% of Canadians use Facebook, and one in four of those users rely on it for news.

Jasprit Bumrah: Why the bowler is so important for the Indian cricket team,"Two players who made their international debut within a year of each other quickly became India's most exciting cricketers. 
With his fearless strokeplay, Rishabh Pant became the darling of spectators around the world. With his unorthodox action, pace and control, Jasprit Bumrah quickly became the spearhead of India's bowling attack. Now both are on the comeback trail.  
Pant, 25, was involved in a horrific car accident in December last year. His rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy - where he recently batted and kept wickets - is, according to those who have been monitoring him, ""ahead of the curve"".  
Bumrah, 29, whose back injury kept him out of cricket for nearly a year, returned as captain and spearhead in the series against Ireland. He seemed to extend his run-up slightly and bowled well within his limits, yet held out hope for a return to white ball cricket - which currently is the focus of the Indian team with the Asia Cup, to be followed by the World Cup in October.  
You can't rush these things. Former chairman of selectors Chetan Sharma in a moment of indiscretion revealed that Bumrah might have been played too early following his injury when he bowled in the T20 against Australia. It cost Sharma his job. But it also emphasised the need for proper rest and rehabilitation, and the importance of listening to your body. Often senior cricketers are allowed to ignore medical advice, and it can prove costly.
Bumrah's return against Ireland was dramatic, with two wickets in his first over. It began with a boundary to Andrew Balbirnie. Bumrah walked back with a wry smile, and then delivered one that seamed back in and knocked back the stumps. It clocked in at 129kmph (80mph), but when you can bowl with that kind of control, pace doesn't matter. The 140kmph mark was breached only rarely. 
When he had Lorcan Tucker caught behind, he had done enough to claim the Person of the Match award on his return. No one asked him, ""Who writes your scripts?"", but it was a question hanging in the air.
Bumrah's premature return against Australia which ruled him out of the T20 World Cup last year is fresh in everybody's mind. Top players often tend to be risk-takers because they would rather be playing than resting. Performances at less than optimum fitness make for some of the sport's most romantic stories. 
VVS Laxman's 281 was made despite him injuring his back days before the Kolkata Test of 2001. Sunil Gavaskar's double century in the West Indies was made while he suffered from a painful toothache. 
Bumrah, with his unorthodox bowling action which invites strain on the back, might have to compromise as his career progresses, cutting down his pace and working on his bag of tricks which is well stocked with yorkers, slower deliveries, seamers, cutters and the odd blinder. 
A wicket-taking Bumrah is probably more valuable to the Indian team - as bowlers tend to be - than a run-scoring batsman. India has a clutch of batsmen who can walk in to one another's shoes, but Bumrah is unique as a bowler. 
Given the background of his injury - and the encouraging signs in Ireland - Bumrah looks ready to trouble better batters. But there are some ifs and buts. He will need to be handled with care, both at the level of selection and by the captain on the field (even if he is captain himself). 
He cannot be expected to bowl full throttle over a long period (Indian captains have tended to overbowl their main bowlers), nor can he be forced to play too many matches in a row. Precious talents require sensitive handling. 
Bumrah's workload was gradually increased during rehab. It wasn't just a T20 game he was preparing for, but as he said: ""I was preparing to bowl 10 overs for the World Cup. I have been bowling 10, 12, even 15 overs. I've bowled more overs, so it becomes easier when you bowl fewer than is required.""   
Ahead of the Ireland game, Bumrah said: ""I don't want to carry any baggage or pressure of expectation."" This attitude probably led to his relaxed demeanour where his characteristic smile was never too far away. It is an attitude important both to the bowler and to Indian cricket.

Hawaii wildfires: The red Lahaina house that survived Maui fires,"Pictures have gone viral of a single red-roofed home that appears virtually unscathed as the neighbourhood around it has been reduced to piles of ash and rubble from the Maui fires. 
The 100-year-old wood house on Front Street is still standing as most of the town of Lahaina has been destroyed. 
Its owners have been left wondering what spared it.
From pictures, ""it looks like it was photoshopped in"", owner Trip Millikin told Honolulu Civil Beat. 
The search and recovery efforts are still ongoing in Maui, with 114 confirmed deaths so far. 
Officials say some 850 people are missing, but over 1,200 people who had been on the list have been found safe. 
The blazes destroyed most of the historic Maui town of Lahaina and the fires are now considered the worst natural disaster in Hawaii state history.
President Joe Biden arrived in Hawaii on Monday to see the devastation. 
The red-roofed home's owners were on a trip to Massachusetts when they heard news of the fire.
Mr Millikin and his wife learnt that the whole neighbourhood had been caught in the blaze and would likely burn down. But the next morning, aerial footage showed their house was intact. 
""We started crying,"" he told Honolulu Civil Beat. ""I felt guilty. We still feel guilty.""
Mr Millikin and his wife said they are unsure exactly what saved their home. Two years ago, the couple purchased the 100-year-old property that used to be a bookkeeper's house for employees of a sugar plantation. 
Mr Millikin and his wife said the house was in disrepair, so they sought to restore it. It may have been these renovations that saved the home, the pair told US media. 
They switched out the home's asphalt roof for one with heavy-gauge metal, surrounded the house with river stones and removed foliage around it. But none of these actions were meant to stop a blaze, they said. 
""It's a 100% wood house, so it's not like we fireproofed it or anything,"" Dora Atwater Millikin told the Los Angeles Times. 
She said as the fires blazed, large pieces of wood would hit people's roofs. ""If it was an asphalt roof, it would catch on fire. And otherwise, they would fall off the roof and then ignite the foliage around the house,"" she said. 
She added that the home's distance from its neighbours may have also served as a cushion. 
The couple say they hope to return to Lahaina when it's safe, and when they do, they plan to offer up their home for the many who have lost theirs. 
""Many people have died,"" said Ms Atwater Millikin. ""So many people have lost everything, and we need to look out for each other and rebuild. Everybody needs to help rebuild.""

Greece wildfires: Authorities on alert for new spate of blazes,"Several parts of Greece are on high alert as extreme temperatures and high winds threaten to spark more devastating wildfires.
Extreme fire risk warnings have been issued for several regions in southern Greece, including around Athens.
The capital has seen searing temperatures over summer - this week they will hover close to 40C (104F).
Dozens of fires broke out at the weekend, prompting thousands of residents to be evacuated.
One of the worst fire fronts is near the port city of Alexandroupolis, close to the north-eastern border with Turkey.
Fires there have been burning for several days, and 13 communities near the city were evacuated ""for the safety of the citizens"", Greece's fire service said in a statement.
There are also fires burning in the eastern Rhodope region and the northern city of Kavala.
France, Cyprus and Romania have sent reinforcements to help Greek firefighters.
At least one person is thought to have died so far as a result of these latest fires. 
According to local media, an 80-year-old man collapsed while trying to save his sheep from the flames in the central Boeotia region, north of Athens.
Summer wildfires are common in Greece but scientists have linked the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, to climate change. 
Just last month, thousands of people were forced to flee fires on the Greek island of Rhodes after wildfires broke out there and in other parts of the country. 
""Greece already had by far its worst July since 2008 in terms of wildfires,"" the EU's Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said on Monday. 
""The burnt area is bigger and the fires are more intense and more violent, burning more area than before.""
A spokesperson for the Greek fire service, Ioannis Artophios, said the country is faced with ""extreme phenomena"" and that everyone needed to ""adapt to this difficult situation.""
Greece is one of several European countries currently at extreme risk of wildfires, according to the EU's climate monitoring service, Copernicus.
Fire crews have been battling a blaze on the Spanish island of Tenerife for almost a week, but the authorities there believe the worst is now behind them. 
The fire has burned through thousands of acres of land and forced the evacuation of more than 12,000 people, according to the regional government. 
Parts of southern France, meanwhile, could experience record-breaking heat in the coming days. Temperatures of more than 40C are expected in places including the Rhone valley.

Israeli woman shot dead in attack on car in southern West Bank,"An Israeli woman has been killed and a man seriously wounded in a suspected Palestinian shooting attack on a car near Hebron in the occupied West Bank.
Two dozen bullets were reportedly fired from a passing vehicle on a highway close to the settlement of Beit Hagai.
The woman has been named as Batsheva Nigri. A girl who was also in the car, said to be her daughter, was unharmed.
The Israeli military said its soldiers were pursuing the suspects and that roadblocks had been set up in the area.
Palestinian media reported they had encircled Hebron and were questioning Palestinians trying to enter or leave the city.
Ms Nigri was a mother of three and nursery teacher who lived in Beit Hagai, according to Israeli media.
She and her 12-year-old daughter had hitched a ride to their home from the man driving the car, reports said. 
The Palestinian militant group Hamas praised the attack, calling it a ""natural response"" to Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank.
Later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the scene and said Israel was ""in the midst of a terror attack"" that was ""encouraged, guided, funded by Iran and its satellite states"".
Meanwhile, the Palestinian health ministry said six Palestinians were shot and wounded by Israeli forces in the village of Beita, in the northern West Bank. One person who was hit in the head was in a critical condition in hospital, it added.
A video circulated online appeared to show a man being shot in the back of the head while he runs away from Israeli troops.  
It comes amid another spike in violence in the West Bank. 
On Saturday, an Israeli man and his son were shot dead by a suspected Palestinian gunman at a car wash near the northern village of Hawara.  
On Friday, Israeli forces shot a 15-year-old Palestinian boy in the head in occupied East Jerusalem, leaving him seriously wounded. Police alleged he had tried to throw a petrol bomb during a raid in the Silwan area.  
Elsewhere that day, video showed an apparently unarmed Palestinian man said to suffer from mental health problems being shot in the leg by Israeli troops during a protest near Israel's separation barrier in Qalqilya. 
There have been dozens of Israeli army raids into Palestinian cities this year as well as violence by Israeli settlers targeting Palestinian homes and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.
Update 22 August 2023: This story has been updated to say that Batsheva Nigri's daughter was 12 years old and not six, as initial reports stated.

Spain country profile,"Spain's location at the crossroads of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, Europe and Africa, has made it a key political and cultural bridge across five continents.
Through exploration and conquest, Spain became a world power in the 16th Century, and maintained a vast overseas empire until the 19th Century.
Its modern history was marked by the bitter civil war of 1936-39, and the ensuing decades-long dictatorship of Francisco Franco.
Since General Franco's death in 1975, Spain has made the transition to democracy, and built a modern economy.
The country's 17 regions have their own directly-elected authorities, but separatism remains a live issue in wealthy Catalonia in the north-east. 
Head of state: King Felipe VI
King Felipe succeeded to the throne on the abdication of his father Juan Carlos in June 2014. 
Born in 1968 when his father was heir-apparent to the vacant throne during the Franco dictatorship, Prince Felipe was educated for his future royal role and undertook official engagements on behalf of the king from 1995.
Despite retaining considerable constitutional power as chief executive and commander-in-chief, King Felipe has pledged to continue his father's legacy of supporting the primacy of parliament.
Prime Minister: Pedro Sánchez
Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez took over as prime minister in June 2018, after his conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy lost a parliamentary vote of confidence.
This was triggered by a long-running corruption trial involving members of Mr Rajoy's Popular Party.
Snap elections in April and November 2019 boosted the Socialists, but they fell short of a majority, while Vox became first far-right party to win seats since the death of Francisco Franco in 1975.
In January 2020, Mr Sánchez formed a minority coalition government with the left-wing Podemos party after winning a narrow parliamentary vote of confidence.
Public broadcaster RTVE shares the market with major commercial operators. Regional TV networks are operated by their respective governments.
Freedom House NGO raises concerns about the concentration of media ownership and what it says is political interference in public media.
Some key dates in Spain's history: 
1492 - The Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon conquer the emirate of Granada, ending nearly 800 years of Muslim rule in the peninsula and founding modern Spain as a united state. 
1492 - Christopher Columbus arrives in the Americas, heralding the conquest of much of South and Central America. 
16th Century - Jews and later Muslims are expelled from Spain during the Inquisition.
16th-17th Centuries - Spanish Empire at its height, with Spain the predominant European power. The rise of Protestant states in northern Europe coupled with struggles with the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean see the country's gradual decline.
18th Century - The War of the Spanish Succession: Spain loses its European possessions outside the Iberian peninsula. 
The Bourbon dynasty, originally from France, centralises the Spanish state, shutting down many regional autonomous assemblies and modernising government and the military.
1807-1814 - Napoleon's France occupies Spain, which had been a French satellite since 1795. Fierce nationalist resistance and British intervention in the Peninsular War gradually forces French troops out.
19th Century - Napoleonic legacy of political division and economic dislocation leaves Spain weak and unstable, with frequent changes of government and a low-level insurgency by Carlist supporters of a rival branch of the royal family. 
All Latin American colonies win their independence, with Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines in Asia lost during a disastrous war with the United States in 1898.
1910s - Spain seeks compensation in conquering colonies in Africa, most significantly northern Morocco and the Spanish Sahara. 
1920s - The trade boom achieved by neutrality in World War One is squandered through fighting Moroccan rebels in the Rif War 1921-26 and the financial mismanagement of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship at home. 
1931 - The return of democratic government leads to an electoral backlash against the monarchy and its allies, and a republic is declared. Radical policies of land reform, labour rights, educational expansion and anti-Church legislation deepen the political divide.
1936 - After two years of right-wing government, a Popular Front coalition of left-wing and liberal parties narrowly wins parliamentary elections and seeks to reintroduce the radical policies of 1931. 
1936-39 - Spanish Civil War: A coup by right-wing military leaders captures only part of the country, leading to three years of bitter civil war. More than 350,000 Spaniards die in the fighting. Italy and Nazi Germany intervene on the side of the Nationalists. The USSR aids the Republicans. 
1939-45 - Spain remains neutral throughout World War Two, although the government is sympathetic to the Axis powers.
1946-50 - Francoist Spain is ostracised by UN and many countries sever diplomatic relations.
1950s - As the Cold War deepens the US gradually improves relations with Spain, extending loans in return for military bases. 
1955 - Spain joins the UN
1958 - Spain joins the World Bank. European countries open up to the Franco government. 
Late 1950s - El Milagro Español - the economic miracle sees manufacturing and tourism take off through liberalisation of state controls. 
1959 - The Eta armed separatist group is founded with the aim of fighting for an independent Basque homeland.
1973 - Eta kills Prime Minister Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco in retaliation for the government's execution of Basque fighters. 
1975 - Franco dies. Succeeded as head of state by King Juan Carlos. Spain makes transition from dictatorship to democracy and withdraws from the Spanish Sahara, ending its colonial empire.
1977 - First free elections in four decades.
1978 - New constitution confirms Spain as a parliamentary monarchy.
1981 - Right-wing coup attempt fails after King Juan Carlos makes a televised address demanding the plotters surrender.
1986 - Spain joins European Economic Community, later to become the European Union.
2002 - Spain adopts the euro.
2004 - 191 people are killed in bomb blasts on rush-hour trains in Madrid in near-simultaneous pre-election attacks by an Islamic group with links to al-Qaeda.
2005 - Parliament legalises gay marriage.
2012 - Eta says it is ready to disband, disarm and enter talks with the French and Spanish governments.
2014 - King Juan Carlos, abdicates in favour of his son, Felipe VI.
2017 - Madrid imposes direct rule in Catalonia after a referendum backs independence from Spain.
2018 - Basque separatist former armed group Eta announces it is ceasing all political activities. 
2019 - Franco's remains are exhumed from the Valley of the Fallen and reburied with his wife in a Madrid cemetery, as part of efforts to remove all public veneration of his dictatorship.

Catalonia media guide,"Catalan-language, locally-based media draw large audiences. TV3, operated by public Televisio de Catalunya, is the leading television station. Public Catalunya Radio tops the radio ratings.
The radio and TV networks of Spain's national public and private broadcasters are available across Catalonia.
Leading daily La Vanguardia introduced a Catalan-language edition in 2011, published in parallel with its established Spanish-language edition. The move led to a sharp rise in the overall number of newspaper readers.
Internet use is widespread and is said to be higher than the Spanish national average. Catalan has a significant online presence; the language is supported by Twitter, YouTube and other major platforms.
A Catalan top-level internet domain, .cat, became available in 2005. Administrators say it is aimed at the online ""Catalan linguistic and cultural community"". 
The independence question plays out across Catalonia's social media.

Several killed by floods on Moscow sewer tour,"At least four people have died after they were trapped underground by flood waters during a guided tour of Moscow's sewer system, local media reports.
City Mayor Sergei Sobyanin confirmed the deaths without saying how many had died, and said authorities were still searching for several missing people.
Sunday's floods, caused by heavy rain, were so rapid people could not escape.
Several companies offer tours of the city's sewers, some of which date from the 19th Century.
Russian media said the body of a teenage girl was found on Sunday evening in the Moskva river near the Zaryadye park in the centre of the city. The following morning, a man and a teenage boy were discovered in the same spot.
A fourth victim was found nearby later on Monday.
The group is said to have been exploring the underground Neglinka river, a tributary of the Moskva.
Originally more than 20 people signed up for the tour, the Ria news agency said, although most of them later withdrew because heavy rain was forecast.
Officials said eight people went ahead with the tour.
Divers are searching the Moskva river for more victims.
A criminal investigation has been launched amid allegations that safety standards were not adhered to.

Catalonia profile,"Proud of its own identity and language, Catalonia is one of Spain's richest and most highly industrialised regions, and also one of the most independent-minded.
Tourism is an important part of Catalonia's economy, but it is manufacturing that makes the region Spain's economic powerhouse, along with a growing service sector.
Many Catalans believe their affluent region pays more to Madrid than it gets back. A 2017 breakaway referendum prompted Spain's deepest political crisis for decades, with the Catalan regional parliament declaring independence and Madrid temporarily imposing direct. rule.
The use of Catalan - a language as close to regional languages of southern France like Occitan as it is to Castilian Spanish - has equal status with Castilian.
Catalan-language, locally-based media draw large audiences. TV3, operated by public Televisio de Catalunya, is the leading television station. Public Catalunya Radio tops the radio ratings.
Some key dates in Catalonia's history: 
11th Century - Region first emerges as a distinct entity with the rise of the County of Barcelona to pre-eminence.
12th Century - The county is brought under the same royal rule as the neighbouring kingdom of Aragon, going on to become a major medieval sea power.
15th Century - King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile marry and unite their realms, creating a united Spanish state, including Catalonia.
Initially retaining its own institutions, the Catalonia is ever more tightly integrated into the Spanish state.
19th Century - Emergence of a renewed sense of Catalan identity. 
1931 - When Spain becomes a republic, Catalonia is given broad autonomy. 
1936-39 - Spanish Civil War: Catalonia is a key Republican stronghold, and the fall of Barcelona to Gen Francisco Franco's right-wing forces in 1939 marks the beginning of the end of republican resistance.
Under Franco's ultra-conservative rule, autonomy is revoked, Catalan nationalism repressed, and use of the Catalan language restricted.
1975 onwards - The pendulum swings back with the emergence of a democratic Spain after Franco's death. 
Catalonia now has its own parliament and executive - together known as the ""Generalitat"" in Catalan - with extensive autonomy.
2010 - Separatist fervour soars after a ruling by Spain's constitutional court set limits on Catalan claims to nationhood. The region's then president Jose Montilla says the ruling ""attacked the dignity of Catalans"". 
2008 - Spain's painful economic crunch also fuels enthusiasm for sovereignty. Many Catalans blame the central government fo rthe country's debt crisis.
2014 - A regional government backed by the two main separatist parties holds a non-binding independence referendum, with 80% of those taking part voting ""yes"". 
2015 - The regional government calls another set of elections to reinforce its mandate
2017 - A further referendum that again backs independence by a large margin - prompts a deep political crisis in Spain. Madrid temporarily imposes direct rule over the region.
After Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and two ministerial colleagues flee, Spain jails nine other Catalan leaders for sedition.
2018 onwards - Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez declares improving the febrile atmosphere in Catalonia a priority.
2021 - Jailed Catalan leaders are pardoned.

Domino's Pizza signals closure of Russian business,"The franchise owner of Domino's in Russia has signalled it will close its branches there as it announced it will place the business into bankruptcy.
DP Eurasia said it would end attempts to sell the pizza chain's shops in the country due to an ""increasingly challenging environment"".
Many Western firms have cut ties with Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and introduction of economic sanctions.
But some, including Domino's, have faced criticism for not exiting.
DP Eurasia has 171 Domino's Pizza shops in Russia. It owns 68 of the sites, while 103 are franchised to local operators.
On Monday, DP Eurasia said in a London Stock Exchange announcement that it had decided its subsidiary in Russia, DP Russia, should file for bankruptcy, rather than seek a buyer.
""With the increasingly challenging environment, DP Russia's immediate holding company is now compelled to take this step, which will bring about the termination of the attempted sale process of DP Russia as a going concern and, inevitably, the group's presence in Russia,"" it said.
The firm previously said it was ""evaluating its presence"" in Russia following sanctions being imposed.
As well as owning Domino's franchises in Russia, DP Eurasia has master franchise rights for the brand in Turkey, Russia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
The Russian economy has been targeted by a raft of sanctions since the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022. 
Many companies that are household names decided to close their operations in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. Pressure was also mounted on big brands such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola to act. 
There has also been ongoing criticism for the ones which have continued business.
Unilever is one company that has defended its decision to keep operating in Russia, with the maker of Dove soap and Cornetto ice cream arguing that it is ""not straightforward"" as its operations would be taken over by the Russian state if it abandoned them.
The Moral Rating Agency, which campaigns for Western firms to leave Russia, has claimed the Unilever was contributing £579m to the Russian economy annually.
Domino's Pizza Inc, the American multi-national business and master franchisor, told the BBC that through its subsidiary companies, it stopped providing ""any support for the Russian market in early 2022"".

Botswana media guide,"State-run outlets dominate the broadcast media. Radio is an important medium and press circulation is mostly limited to urban areas. 
State media have been accused of acting as mouthpieces for the ruling party, says US-based Freedom House. It says some private outlets report critically on the government, but fear of reprisals can lead to self-censorship. 
There were 1.2 million internet users by December 2021, comprising 51% of the population (Internetworldstats.com).

Belgium media guide,"Belgium's media scene reflects the country's cultural make-up. The Flemish, French and German language communities are served by largely separate public and private operators.
So, unlike most other European countries, Belgium does not have a single public broadcasting organisation. 
Media ownership is very concentrated. Most newspapers, TV and radio outlets are owned by a small number of Belgian companies. De Persgroep is the largest private media group.
Cable TV is widely watched and stations in neighbouring countries, particularly France and the Netherlands, have large audiences.
Global media watchdogs give Belgium high ratings for press freedom. A law on journalists' rights to keep their contacts confidential is ""one of the most protective in the world"", says Reporters Without Borders.
There were 10.7 million internet users by July 2022, 92% of the population (Internetworldstats.com). Facebook is the leading social media platform.

Belgium country profile,"For such a small country, Belgium has been a major European battleground over the centuries.  
Occupied by Germany during both world wars, it experienced an economic boom in the post-war years to become a model Western European liberal democracy.
However, there has also been a growing divide between the mainly Dutch-speaking north and the mainly French-speaking south, as well as concerns about the growth of Islamic extremism among immigrant communities in the capital, Brussels.
Brussels is the headquarters of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), making it the polyglot home of an army of international diplomats and civil servants.
Head of state: King Philippe
King Philippe succeeded to the throne in July 2013 on the abdication of his father, Albert II, who stepped down on health grounds.
Respect for the monarchy is one of the few factors that crosses the communal divide in Belgium, and King Albert exercised his constitutional authority in advising political leaders on the formation of a government during the 2010-2011 parliamentary stalemate.
Prime minister: Alexander De Croo
Finance Minister De Croo took over in October 2020 from an interim government led by Sophie Wilmès, who later served as foreign minister.
Mr De Croo, a liberal Flemish politician, has been a deputy prime minister with various responsibilities since 2012. He heads a seven-party coalition of liberals, socialists, greens and Christian democrats.
Belgian broadcasting mirrors the unique political and linguistic nature of the country. The cultural communities, rather than the federal authorities, are responsible for regulating radio and TV.

Leftist leads Ecuador presidential poll count amid spike in violence,"Left-winger Luisa Gonzalez is leading in Ecuador's presidential election overshadowed by the assassination of one of the candidates.
With nearly 80% of the votes counted, electoral officials say she has 33%, while her closest rival Daniel Noboa, a businessman, is on 24%.
The top two candidates will now go into a run-off on 15 October. 
The poll was combined with a referendum, in which voters chose to end oil drilling in the Amazon.
The decision, supported by nearly 60% of those who voted, means the state-owned oil company will have to stop its operations in a block of Yasuní National Park, one of the world's largest biodiversity hotspots. 
The area is home to hundreds of species of birds, amphibians and reptiles as well as indigenous people like the Tagaeri and Taromenani - who live in self-isolation. 
The outcome is a significant blow to outgoing President Guillermo Lasso, who argued revenues from oil drilling were crucial for Ecuador's economy. 
Some 100,000 police and soldiers were deployed to protect Sunday's first round of voting.
The snap election was called after Mr Lasso - a conservative former banker - dissolved parliament to avoid impeachment. 
Sunday's voting was peaceful, much to the relief of Ecuadoreans fearful of the political violence that has taken hold of the country. 
However, there were several shooting incidents in the run-up to the vote.
The new president will take office on 26 October and will serve only 18 months - the remainder of Mr Lasso's term.
Ms Gonzalez, a 45-year-old protégé of leftist ex-President Rafael Correa, was seen as the firm favourite of the eight politicians vying for the presidency.
But the assassination of candidate Fernando Villavicencio on 9 August in the capital, Quito, made the election difficult to predict.
Ms Gonzalez's promises of a return of generous social programmes appeal to Ecuadoreans hit hard by an economic crisis. 
However, voters are divided politically.   
Mr Correa still looms large in the country: he cut poverty while in power, but was then mired in corruption scandals and is now in exile in Belgium. 
Those who want an end to his influence in Ecuador will back pro-business candidate Daniel Noboa, aged 35. 
The only thing that unites Ecuadoreans is their need for peace and security. Everyone is hoping for a peaceful campaign ahead of the run-off.
Mr Villavicencio, 59, was an outspoken journalist who had uncovered corruption and denounced links between organised crime and officials.
Six men have been arrested in connection with his assassination, all of them Colombian citizens.

Hundreds of migrants killed by Saudi border guards - report,"Saudi border guards are accused of the mass killing of migrants along the Yemeni border in a new report by Human Rights Watch.
The report says hundreds of people, many of them Ethiopians who cross war-torn Yemen to reach Saudi Arabia, have been shot dead.
Migrants have told the BBC they had limbs severed by gunfire and saw bodies left on the trails.
Saudi Arabia has previously rejected allegations of systematic killings.
The Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, titled They Fired On Us Like Rain, contains graphic testimony from migrants who say they were shot at and sometimes targeted with explosive weapons by Saudi police and soldiers on Yemen's rugged northern border with Saudi Arabia.
Migrants contacted separately by the BBC have spoken of terrifying night-time crossings during which large groups of Ethiopians, including many women and children, came under fire as they attempted to cross the border in search of work in the oil-rich kingdom.
""The shooting went on and on,"" 21-year-old Mustafa Soufia Mohammed told the BBC.
He said some in his group of 45 migrants were killed when they came under fire as they tried to sneak across the border in July last year.
""I didn't even notice I was shot,"" he said, ""but when I tried to get up and walk, part of my leg was not with me.""
It was a brutal, chaotic end to a three-month journey fraught with danger, starvation and violence at the hands of Yemeni and Ethiopian smugglers.
A video filmed hours later shows his left foot almost completely severed. Mustafa's leg was amputated below the knee and now, back with his parents in Ethiopia, he walks with crutches and an ill-fitting prosthetic limb.
""I went to Saudi Arabia because I wanted to improve my family's life,"" the father-of-two said, ""but what I hoped for didn't materialise. Now my parents do everything for me.""
Another Ethiopian migrant, who we are calling Ibsaa to protect his identity, said he was shot at the border by men wearing Saudi military uniforms.
""They beat us, killed some and took those who survived to the hospital. The bodies of those killed were left scattered on the ground,"" he told the BBC.
""I was shot between my thighs near my groin, and my legs are paralyzed now. I can't even walk. I thought I would die.""
Some survivors show signs of deep trauma.
In the Yemeni capital, Zahra can barely bring herself to speak about what happened.
She says she is 18, but looks younger. We are not using her real name to protect her identity.
Her journey, which had already cost around $2,500 (£1,950) in ransoms and bribes, ended in a hail of bullets at the border.
One bullet took all the fingers of one hand. Asked about her injury, she looks away and cannot answer.
According to the UN's International Organization for Migration, tens of thousands of people a year attempt a perilous journey, crossing by sea from the Horn of Africa to Yemen and then travelling on to Saudi Arabia.
Human rights organisations say many experience imprisonment and beatings along the way.
The sea crossing is dangerous enough. More than 24 migrants were reported missing last week after a shipwreck off the coast of Djibouti.
In Yemen, the main migrant routes are littered with the graves of people who have died along the way.
Dozens of migrants were killed two years ago when fire tore through a detention centre in the capital, Sanaa, run by the country's Houthi rebels who control most of northern Yemen.
But the abuses outlined in the latest HRW report are different in scale and nature.
""What we documented are essentially mass killings,"" the report's lead author, Nadia Hardman, told the BBC.
""People described sites that sound like killing fields - bodies strewn all over the hillside,"" she said.
The report, which covers the period from March 2022 to June this year, details 28 separate incidents involving explosive weapons and 14 of shootings at close range.
""I have seen hundreds of graphic images and videos sent to me by survivors. They depict pretty terrifying injuries and blast wounds.""
The remoteness of the border crossings and the difficulty of tracking down survivors make it impossible to know precisely how many people have been killed, say the authors.
""We say a minimum of 655, but it's likely to be thousands,"" Hardman said. ""We have factually demonstrated that the abuses are widespread and systematic and may amount to a crime against humanity,"" she said.
Reports of widespread killings perpetrated by Saudi security forces along the northern border first surfaced last October in a letter by UN experts to the government in Riyadh.
They highlighted ""what appears to be a systematic pattern of large-scale, indiscriminate cross-border killings, using artillery shelling and small arms fired by Saudi security forces against migrants.""
Despite the horrific nature of the allegations, the letter went largely unreported.
The Saudi government said it took the allegations seriously but strongly rejected the UN's characterisation that the killings were systematic or large-scale.
""Based on the limited information provided,"" the government replied, ""authorities within the Kingdom have discovered no information or evidence to confirm or substantiate the allegations.""
But last month, the Mixed Migration Centre, a global research network, published further allegations of killings along the border, based on its own interviews with survivors.
Its report contains graphic descriptions of rotting corpses scattered throughout the border area, captured migrants being asked by Saudi border guards which leg they want to be shot through, and machine guns and mortars being used to attack large groups of terrified people.
The report from Human Rights Watch is the most detailed yet, with multiple eyewitness reports and satellite imagery of the crossing points where many of the killings are said to have taken place, as well as makeshift burial sites.
The report also identifies a detention centre at Monabbih, just inside Yemen, where migrants are held before being escorted to the border by armed smugglers.
According to one migrant interviewed by HRW, Yemen's Houthi rebels are in charge of security at Monabbih and work alongside the smugglers.
A satellite photo shows bright orange tents packed closely together inside a fenced-off compound.
While the HRW report covers events up to June this year, the BBC has uncovered evidence that the killings are continuing.
In the northern city of Saada, footage seen by the BBC shows migrants injured at the border arriving in a hospital as late as Friday. In a nearby cemetery, burials were taking place.
The BBC has approached the Saudi government for comment about the allegations made by UN rapporteurs, the Mixed Migration Centre and Human Rights Watch, but has not received a response.
A Saudi government source told AFP news agency that the allegations were ""unfounded and not based on reliable sources"".
In a letter sent to HRW in response to the report, the Houthi-led government in Sanaa said it was aware of ""deliberate killings of immigrants and Yemenis"" by Saudi border guards. It also denied working with smugglers, saying it considered them to be criminals.

How does the Republican Party pick its presidential nominee?,"Donald Trump is running again to be US president. It's a long road to the White House and first he must win a race within his own Republican Party. The winner will likely face President Joe Biden in the 2024 election. Here's what you need to know. 
The liberal Democrats are currently in the White House and the conservative Republicans are in opposition. Democrats tend to believe in bigger government support and spending while Republicans typically call for lower spending and stripping back the state. 
Trump has been a leading figure in the Republican Party since 2016, when he won the presidency. However, he lost to Democrat Biden in the 2020 election. For the next presidential run-off in 2024, Republicans need to pick another candidate - a process called the primaries. Biden is not expected to face a serious challenge from another Democrat. 
Candidates begin putting themselves forward well over a year before the presidential election kicks off. Each state holds an election to vote on who they want as party nominee and the overall winner is officially crowned at the Republican National Convention (RNC) - a big political event in July 2024. 
Nearly all the states hold their primary elections in the same way - a secret ballot, like a general election. A small number of states have a caucus which is a head count or a show of hands. The states have different rules on who can vote - often only Republican Party members. Based on how many votes they win, the candidates get a certain number of delegates who represent them at the convention. 
After Iowa, there is the New Hampshire primary, and then elections take place in all 50 states plus other US territories. Super Tuesday in March is when lots of states hold elections on the same day. It may be clear then who will win, although voting continues until June 2024.  
The first debate is soon, 23 August. To get on stage you need a certain level of donations and support in national polls (surveys showing how people intend to vote). Debaters must promise to back whoever wins the primaries although Trump refused to do that and he has now pulled out of the first debate. Millions usually tune in to watch the presidential hopefuls discuss policy and trade insults. In 2015, Trump even sparred with host Megyn Kelly over his comments about women.
Trump remains the most popular candidate in Republican polls - despite facing criminal charges. He has been accused of illegally stashing secret documents, covering up payments to a porn star and attempting to overturn election results. He denies wrongdoing and says the charges are political. Even if he went to prison, he could still remain in the race for the White House. 
His Republican rivals include Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, his former vice-president Mike Pence and former US ambassador at the UN Nikki Haley. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie has been one of Trump's strongest critics while Vivek Ramaswamy, an Indian American businessman, has promised to take on the corporate world's ""wokeism"" on racism and climate.

"Ron Cephas Jones, This Is Us star, dies aged 66","US actor Ron Cephas Jones has died at the age of 66.
A veteran stage actor, he was best known for the series This Is Us - his role as a long-lost father who finds redemption earned him two Emmy Awards. 
Jones had a ""long-standing pulmonary issue"", his manager told US outlets. He had a double lung transplant in 2020, according to media reports.
His ""kindness and heart were felt by anyone who had the good fortune of knowing him"", his manager said. 
Jones's love for the stage ""was present throughout his entire career, including his recent Tony-nominated and Drama Desk Award-winning performance for his role in Clyde's on Broadway"", the statement added.
Academy Award-winning actress Octavia Spencer, who played alongside Jones in the series Truth Be Told, was among the co-stars remembering the late actor.
She wrote on Instagram that she was ""heartbroken"" by the news.
""Ron was an incredibly talented actor and, most importantly, a wonderfully kind human being,"" Spencer said. ""Every day on set with Ron was a good day.""
In This Is Us, Jones played William ""Shakespeare"" Hill, a father who abandoned his child at birth before connecting with his son's adoptive family in later life.
Sterling K Brown, who plays Hill's son, Randall Pearson, paid tribute to Jones on Instagram: ""Life imitated art today, and one of the most wonderful people the world has ever seen is no longer with us.""
New Jersey-born Jones, a jazz aficionado, once worked as a California bus driver before returning to New York in the mid-1980s where he pursued his acting career.
Speaking about his celebrated role with content platform Build Series, Jones said: ""I knew William, I grew up with men like him. A large part of him is inside me already, so it was more about reaching inside and remembering the men I grew up with like him.""
Jones won the Emmy for best guest actor in a drama series for the role in 2018 and 2020.
US actress Mandy Moore, who played Rebecca Pearson on the show, said getting to know and work with him was the ""greatest gift"".
""He was pure magic as a human and an artist... I will treasure all of the moments forever,"" she wrote on Instagram.
The show's creator Dan Fogelman described Jones as ""the best of the best - on screen, on stage, and in real life"".
""A massive loss... The coolest,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The easiest hang and laugh. And my God: what an actor.""
Jones spent most of his career in the theatre before and after This is Us. He worked with Oscar-winning director Sir Sam Mendes on productions of As You Like It and The Tempest.
Sir Sam told the PA news agency he was ""beyond sad"" at the news of his death. 
""An absolutely wonderful actor, and the gentlest, wisest, most soulful man,"" he said.

Donald Trump confirms he will skip Republican presidential debate,"Donald Trump has confirmed that he will not take part in the upcoming Republican presidential debate with his rivals in the race for the White House.
The ex-president said one latest poll showed he had ""legendary"" numbers ahead of other hopefuls to be the party's nominee for the 2024 election.
It is not immediately clear if Mr Trump will be skipping all the debates for the Republican primaries. 
The first Republican presidential primary debate will be on 23 August.
Voting begins in the state of Iowa on 15 January 2024.
Recent polls have consistently shown that Mr Trump - who faces a number of criminal charges - is currently the front-runner for the Republican nomination.
In a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Mr Trump confirmed he would not attend the debate, and pointed to the latest poll indicating he was leading the Republican field. 
""The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,"" Mr Trump said. ""I will therefore not be doing the debates.""
A poll from the BBC's US partner CBS News suggests his closest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, is lagging well behind. 
In recent months, Mr Trump had repeatedly suggested that he would not join the Republican debates. 
The former president plans to sit for a pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that may run during the first debate in Milwaukee on Wednesday, sources familiar with the planning have told CBS. 
Mr Trump's suggestion that he would skip this week's debate sparked criticism from at least one of his Republican rivals, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. 
""If he believes he should be the nominee, if he believes that he's got such a great record, if he believes he's the best person to go against Joe Biden, then show up on Wednesday night and stop being such a coward,"" Mr Christie said last week. 
Republican presidential hopefuls must meet several qualifications to attend the debate, including receiving donations from at least 40,000 individuals and obtaining at least 1% in high-quality polling.
So far, former Vice-President Mike Pence, Mr DeSantis, Mr Christie, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott are all confirmed to have qualified.
The first Republican debate comes the same week that Mr Trump has to voluntarily surrender in Fulton County, Georgia. 
He must appear by 25 August in the state to face charges of trying to overturn the result of the 2020 election in the state.
Donald Trump is facing dozens of criminal charges and will go on trial several times in the next 18 months, even as he campaigns to become president again in the 2024 US election.
Aside from Mr Trump's most recent Georgia charges, he has been charged in Florida with illegally hoarding classified files at his estate there, Mar-a-Lago, and refusing to hand them back when asked.
His third indictment was unveiled this month in Washington DC, where prosecutors accuse him of repeatedly airing the false claim he had won the last presidential election.
He has repeatedly described the various charges against him as a political ""witch hunt"".

Bahrain media guide,"The government owns all national broadcast media outlets, and the private owners of Bahrain's main newspapers have close ties to the state - they all follow a pro-government editorial line. 
A rare critical voice, Al-Wasat newspaper, was shut down in 2017. An opposition satellite station, Lualua TV, operates from London.
Self-censorship is encouraged by vaguely worded laws allowing the state to imprison journalists for criticizing the king or Islam or for threatening national security, says the NGP Freedom House.
Reporters Without Borders has said that Bahrain is ""notorious"" for jailing journalists and that reporters working for international media have faced problems renewing their accreditation. 
There is an advanced telecommunication sector. Bahrain has one of the highest internet penetration rates in the Arab world. There were 1.8 million internet users by July 2022, so more than 100% of the population (Internetworldstats.com).
The authorities closely monitor online activity. Dozens of bloggers and social media activists have been detained or jailed for their internet activities. Freedom House has said the government blocks access to hundreds of websites. 
BBC World Service is on FM in Manama (101.0 in English; 103.8 in Arabic).

Bahrain country profile,"Bahrain was one of the first states in the Gulf to discover oil and to build a refinery. It never reached the levels of production enjoyed by Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, and so has had to diversify its economy.
The country is ruled by a Sunni king, whose family holds the main political and military posts. The divide between the Shia majority and the Sunni rulers has led to long-running tension, which has sporadically boiled over into civil disobedience. 
Bahrain was once viewed as a promising model for political reform and democratic transition, but since crushing a popular prodemocracy protest movement in 2011, the monarchy has systematically eliminated a broad range of political rights and civil liberties.
King: Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah
Sheikh Hamad, who has led the country since 1999, changed his title from emir to king when Bahrain became a kingdom in 2002.
Born in 1950, he was educated at a public school in Cambridge and went on to study at Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot in the UK and at the US Army Command and Staff College at Fort Leavenworth.
Under his leadership, the country has faced protests and civil unrest from the Shia majority, with demonstrators saying the ruling Sunni minority shuts them out of housing, healthcare and government jobs.
The media are under tight official control. The main TV and radio networks are state-run and newspapers follow a pro-government editorial line.
Media watchdog Freedom House says legislation is used to detain or jail critical journalists and online activists.
Bahrain has one of the highest rates of internet penetration in the Arab world. 
Some key dates in Bahrain's history:
1602-1783 - Persian rule. 
1783 - Rule by sheikhs of the Khalifah family.
1861 - Britain assumes responsibility for the Bahrain's defence and foreign relations.
1913 - Britain and the Ottoman government sign a treaty recognising the independence of Bahrain but the country remains under British administration.
1931 - The Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco), a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California (Socal), discovers oil at Jabal al-Dukhan and production begins the following year.
1967 - Britain moves its main regional naval base from Aden to Bahrain, a year before deciding to close all its bases east of Suez by 1971. 
1970 - Iran under the shah renounces claims to Bahrain, but the successor Islamic Republic of Iran does not recognise this renunciation.
1971 - Bahrain declares independence and signs a new treaty of friendship with Britain. Sheikh Isa becomes the first emir and the council of state becomes a cabinet.
1981 - Bahrain joins the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which also includes Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 
1986 - Opening of the King Fahd causeway which links Bahrain to the mainland of Saudi Arabia. 
1991 - Bahrain signs a defence cooperation agreement with the United States, providing for port facilities and joint military exercises. 
2001 - Referendum on political reform; Bahrainis overwhelmingly back proposals under which Bahrain would become constitutional monarchy with elected lower chamber of parliament and independent judiciary.
2011 - Protesters gather in Manama, inspired by popular revolts that toppled rulers in Tunisia and Egypt. Saudi troops take part in a crackdown. 
2018 - Bahrain reports discovery of the kingdom's largest oilfield in more than 80 years.
Opposition leader Sheikh Ali Salman of the banned Al-Wefaq party is sentenced to life in jail on charges of spying for Bahrain's rival, Qatar. Rights organisations criticise the trial as politically-motivated.

Dublin branded 'unsafe' following latest assault ,"At a glance
Fianna Fáil TD Jim O'Callaghan said that parts of Dublin were unsafe
He was speaking following an assault in the city on Sunday 
The Department of Justice condemned the attack and said Minister Helen McEntee was committed to ensuring people are safe and feel safe in Dublin
Parts of Ireland's capital have been described as unsafe following another assault in the city. 
Fianna Fáil Justice spokesman and TD for Dublin Bay south Jim O'Callaghan has raised concerns about the levels of ""open criminal activity"" in Dublin.
Mr O'Callaghan was speaking on  RTÉ's Morning Ireland following a stabbing on Grafton Street on Sunday. 
The Department of Justice said Minister Helen McEntee was ""committed to ensuring Dubliners working and living in our capital, and those who visit the city, are safe and feel safe"".
In the latest attack a man in his 30s was taken to St James's Hospital to be treated for non-life threatening injuries. 
The incident is the latest in a serious of high-profile attacks in the city, including a recent assault on an American tourist that left him in a coma, and another assault in June in which a man in his 40s was killed.
""Parts of Dublin are unsafe at certain times during the day and night and I think that's a problem,"" Mr O'Callaghan said.
Justice Minister Helen McEntee says she is committed to ensuring people feel safe and are safe in Dublin 
Richard Guiney, CEO of Dublin Town, which represents businesses in the city, also raised concerns about safety in Dublin. 
""There are clearly issues that need to be addressed, people don’t feel as safe in the city as they should.
""There are clearly issues in terms of how we deal with our social difficulties and vulnerable people,"" he said. 
Both Mr O'Callaghan and Mr Guiney said there were not enough police on Dublin's streets. 
The department of justice highlighted the recently announced additional €10m in overtime for An Garda Síochána (Irish Police) as well as progress that puts Ireland  ""on track to have between 700 and 800 new recruits"" to its police force in 2023.
Mr Guiney said that while those announcements were welcome ""we’d like to see more"".
Mr O'Callaghan argued ""you don’t see the same level of visibility of policing in Dublin as you do in other international cities"". 
Although both men conceded that more police did not represent a ""complete solution"".

Gas prices rise on fears of strikes in Australia,"The prospect of a possible strike at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Australia has pushed wholesale gas prices up in Europe.
The Offshore Alliance union warned that a strike at the North West Shelf facility could start as early as 2 September if no deal on pay is reached.
Benchmark gas prices for the EU and UK rose around 10% on Monday, according to Bloomberg.
Prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine but have since fallen.
There are fears that strike action at Woodside Energy Group's North West Shelf facility could cause disruption to shipments of LNG from Australia, which is a key global supplier.
Workers at two other offshore LNG facilities, Gorgon and Wheatstone, operated by Chevron, are also voting on strike action, with results expected on Thursday.
Together the three plants make up about 10% of the world's supply of LNG.
Ben McWilliams, an affiliate fellow at the think tank Bruegel, warned the strikes might impact the prices globally of LNG.
Speaking to the BBC's Newsday programme earlier this month, Mr McWilliams said: ""Australia typically supplies Asia, but if these strikes were to go ahead, and Australian gas were cut to Asian consumers, we would see Asian consumers turning around and looking, for example, to Qatar and competing with European buyers there.""
Mr McWilliams said that if that were to happen there would be a ""knock-on effect on prices"".
Following the start of the war in Ukraine, Russia slashed supplies of natural gas to Europe, which led countries to seek out alternative sources of energy.
Many countries are relying on LNG to fill the gap.
Australia is one of the world's largest exporters of LNG. The others are Qatar and the US.
Last week, Cornwall Insight predicted that higher gas prices resulting from the Australian uncertainty would contribute to a significant rise in the Ofgem price cap in January. 
It forecast a cap of £2,082.56 for a typical annual household bill for the first quarter of 2024, a rise from its £1,925.71 forecast for the fourth quarter of 2023.

Guatemala country profile,"Guatemala is still trying to come to terms with a 36-year-long civil war. 
The conflict, which ended in 1996, pitted leftist, mostly Mayan insurgents against the state, which - backed by the US - waged a vicious campaign to eliminate the guerrillas.
More than 200,000 people - most of them civilians - were killed or disappeared.
A peace accord negotiated by the United Nations has resulted in continued economic growth and successful democratic elections, although corruption, poverty, crime, drug trafficking and civil instability remain major issues.
It is a country of striking features and a strong indigenous culture. It is mountainous, forested and dotted with Mayan ruins, lakes, volcanoes and orchids.
The indigenous Maya make up about half of the population but rights campaigners say they face extreme inequality. The country is a major corridor for smuggling drugs.
President-elect: Bernardo Arevalo
Anti-corruption candidate Bernardo Arevalo swept to a shock win in Guatemala's August 2023 presidential election, a victory seen as a repudiation of the political elite in the Central American nation, long the target of corruption allegations.
The 64-year old former diplomat led his rival, former first lady Sandra Torres, with 58% to 37% in the second round of voting. ""The people of Guatemala have spoken forcefully,"" Mr Arevalo told reporters after his win. ""Enough with so much corruption.""
The son of former president Juan José Arévalo, his campaign pulled off a massive upset, defying opinion polls, legal challenges and attempts to disqualify his Movimiento Semilla, or Seed Movement, party.
Mr Arevalo replaces unpopular right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei, who is constitutionally barred from re-election. Mr Giammattei's rule saw several anti-graft prosecutors arrested or forced into exile. He has also cracked down on critical journalists.
Mr Arevalo will be sworn in on 14 January 2024 as corruption, poverty and gang violence push thousands to emigrate in search of better lives, many to the US.
Journalists who expose corruption among politicians and officials face threats and violence, say press freedom watchdogs. 
Privately-owned outlets dominate the media. Ownership is highly concentrated, especially in the TV industry.

Brics summit: What does South Africa get out of Brics?,"This video can not be played
The five Brics countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - are holding their 15th annual summit in Johannesburg. However, one of the nations leaders, Vladimir Putin, will not be there.
The G7 nations have been very critical of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the Brics
nations, including South Africa, less so. 
The BBC's Kim Chakanetsa takes a look at why that is.

China cuts key interest rate as recovery falters,"China's central bank has cut one of its key interest rates for the second time in three months as the world's second-largest economy struggles to bounce back from the pandemic.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered its one-year loan prime rate to 3.45% from 3.55%.
The country's post-Covid recovery has been hit by a property crisis, falling exports and weak consumer spending.
In contrast, other major economies have raised rates to tackle high inflation.
The PBOC last cut its one-year rate - on which most of China's household and business loans are based - in June.
Jun Bei Liu from Tribeca Investment Partners told the BBC that the move is unlikely to have a major impact but does indicate the Chinese government's commitment to reviving the economy.
""We will need bigger stimulus package to boost confidence and in turn drive up consumption and growth. Without it, the economy is risking faltering into deflation which will be harder to revive,"" she added.
Economists had also expected the bank to lower its five-year loan prime rate, which the country's mortgages are pegged to. However, it was unchanged at 4.2%.
In a surprise move last week, short and medium-term rates were also cut.
""More rate cuts could be announced in conjunction with government spending, as well as targeted measures to help the property market,"" Catherine Yeung, investment director at Fidelity International said.
While Beijing is trying to restore confidence, officials will also be mindful of the long-term implications of the policies, she added.
China's economy has struggled to overcome several major issues in the wake of the pandemic, which saw much of the world shut down.
Last week, the serious problems in its property market were highlighted when crisis-hit real estate giant Evergrande filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.
The heavily-indebted company is still working on a multi-billion dollar deal with creditors.
Earlier this month, another of the country's biggest property developers, Country Garden, warned that it could see a loss of up to $7.6bn (£6bn) for the first six months of the year.
In the same week, official figures showed China had slipped into deflation for the first time in more than two years.
That was as the official consumer price index, a measure of inflation, fell by 0.3% last month from a year earlier.
Meanwhile, official figures showed China's imports and exports fell sharply in July as weaker global demand threatened the country's recovery prospects.
Beijing has also stopped releasing youth unemployment figures, which were seen by some as a key indication of the country's slowdown.
In June, China's jobless rate for 16 to 24-year-olds in urban areas hit a record high of more than 20%.
Andy Jie, an independent analyst in Shanghai, told the BBC that young people in China needed to adjust their expectations on the types of jobs available to them. 
""Around 70% of young people in China now go to university and so expect to get a white-collar job afterwards. They want desk jobs, staring at computers. But that's not possible.""
However, George Godber, a fund manager at Polar Capital in London, said it was not an issue the Chinese government could avoid.
""Youth unemployment tends to drive government policy ahead of most things because nobody wants a disaffected group of young workers.""

Storm Hilary hits California after lashing Mexico,"Tropical Storm Hilary hit the US state of California on Sunday night, bringing fierce winds and flooding to the Pacific coast. 
Now headed north to Nevada, the storm passed over Southern California, with record rainfall and flash flooding predicted in the Death Valley National Park. 
It moved across the border from Mexico, where the Baja California peninsula saw winds of 70 mph (119km/h). 
In Mexico, a man died in a flash flood. 
A number of houses are now submerged in the town of Santa Rosalia, Mexico, while some residents in California have been forced to evacuate. 
Schools have also had to close for Monday, including Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the country. 
The last time a tropical storm made landfall in Southern California was in Long Beach in 1939. 
Hilary is set to weaken as it moves north, but forecasters warn it could still bring dangerous and catastrophic flooding to the state. 
""Areas that normally do not experience flash flooding will flood,"" the National Weather Service said. ""Lives and property are in great danger through Monday.""
Experts say recent abnormal weather events that have plagued the US - and several areas across the globe - have been influenced by human-caused climate change.
The storm made landfall in the northern part of Mexico's Baja California peninsula at 11:00 local time (18:00 GMT) on Sunday, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
In Mexico, 18,000 soldiers were placed on standby earlier to assist in rescue efforts.
The man who died in the state of Baja California Sur was in a car with his wife and children, local officials said - his family survived.
In Santa Rosalia, on the state's eastern coast, dramatic videos have emerged showing powerful torrents of muddy water cascading down the main street. 
Across California, residents have been putting out sandbags, including in Long Beach and Palm Springs. About 57,000 people in the state are without power, according to poweroutage.us. 
Eugenie Adler, a resident of Long Beach, told Reuters: ""Flooding where people lose some property is one thing, but flooding where people die is another. And I'm afraid people might die.""
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called it ""an unprecedented weather event"".
""But Los Angeles has deep experience responding to crises whether it be wildfire or earthquakes,"" she said. ""The city is prepared.""
Nearly 26 million people in the south-western US are under flood watch.
Hilary was downgraded to a Category 1 storm after weakening on Saturday, but officials kept up their warnings. 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km) from its centre, according to the NHC.
Nancy Ward, director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, said Hilary could be one of the worst storms to hit the state in more than a decade.
""Make no mistake,"" she told a news conference on Saturday. ""This is a very, very dangerous and significant storm.""
Up to 10 in (25cm) of rain is expected in parts of Mexico, California and Nevada, according to the NHC. On Sunday, rain began to fall in Southern California deserts.
As the storm approached, Major League Baseball rescheduled three games in southern California, while SpaceX postponed the launch of a rocket from its base on the central California coast until at least Monday.
The National Park Service also closed Joshua Tree National Park and Mojave National Preserve, both in California, to prevent visitors from being stranded in the event of flooding.
Extreme weather has recently caused chaos across North America.
In the wake of the hottest month on record, July 2023, according to Nasa, the deadliest wildfire in modern US history spread across Hawaii on 8 August, killing at least 111 people. 
The damage was escalated by hurricane winds passing through the area.
And in Canada, hundreds of wildfires are raging in the province of British Columbia, scorching homes and forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate.

Three guilty over Swiss museum £2m stolen Ming vase sale plot,"Three men have been convicted in London in connection with the theft of a £2m vase from a Swiss museum.
The vase, which dates from the Chinese Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), was stolen from the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva in June 2019.
The Met, in co-operation with Swiss law enforcement, carried out an undercover operation targeting those trying to sell the item. 
The vase was recovered in October 2021 and returned to the museum.
At Southwark Crown Court on Friday, Mbaki Nkhwa, 47, of The Heights, Charlton, and Kaine Wright, 26, of Heavitree Road, Woolwich, were each found guilty of one count of conspiracy to convert criminal property.
David Lamming, 31, of Belmont Park Close, Lewisham, admitted the same offence at an earlier hearing on 23 March 2023.
In July 2020, police received call from an auction house saying that an unknown person who knew of the vase's whereabouts had emailed to seek a valuation. 
The Met traced the IP address for the email account to Lamming's home. 
Officers posed as prospective buyers when the vase went up for sale, agreeing a price of £450,000, a Met spokesperson said. 
This led to a meeting in a central London hotel where Nkhwa handed over the vase to officers.
He was then arrested at the scene. Phone data showed he and Lamming had been in regular contact with Kane, who had driven to the hotel for the exchange.
Det Ch Insp Matt Webb, from the Met's Specialist Crime Command, said: ""These convictions are the result of four years' work crossing international boundaries and involving collaboration between many internal and external partners.
""The organised crime group involved in this offending believed they could commit significant offences internationally and that there would be no comeback. They were mistaken.""
He added that the vase - actually a bottle of the Yongle period - had ""an interesting tale over its hundreds of years and this is another chapter"". 
All three will be sentenced on 13 October. Nkhwa and Wright have been remanded in custody while Lamming has been bailed.
Three items with a total estimated worth of £3.5m were stolen from the museum, the Met said. 
A bowl valued at £80,000 was sold at an auction house in Hong Kong in 2019 but subsequently returned to the museum.
Police are offering a £10,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of a Ming Dynasty cup, the third item stolen.
Stewart and Louis Ahearne, two brothers from Woolwich, are awaiting trial in Switzerland over the museum thefts following their extradition late last year.

Bernardo Arevalo: Anti-corruption leader wins Guatemala election,"An anti-corruption candidate has swept to a shock win in Guatemala's presidential election.
Bernardo Arevalo's victory is seen as a repudiation of the political elite in the Central American nation, long the target of corruption allegations.
The 64-year old former diplomat led his rival, former first lady Sandra Torres, 58% to 37% with all votes counted.
""The people of Guatemala have spoken forcefully,"" Mr Arevalo told reporters. ""Enough with so much corruption.""
Guatemala ranks 150th out of 180 in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2022, tied with Afghanistan and the Central African Republic.
Mr Arevalo's supporters celebrated his victory on the streets of the capital Guatemala City on Sunday night, waving flags and lighting fireworks.
""This triumph represents the defeat of a corrupt system,"" said one of his supporters, sociologist Jorge Mendoza.
The son of former president Juan José Arévalo, his campaign pulled off a massive upset, defying opinion polls, legal challenges and attempts to disqualify his Movimiento Semilla, or Seed Movement, party.
In the first round of voting last 25 June, Mr Arevalo placed a surprise second to Ms Torres, who has the support of the political elite.
Mr Arevalo will replace unpopular right-wing President Alejandro Giammattei, who is constitutionally barred from re-election. The outgoing leader congratulated Mr Arevalo on X, formerly known as Twitter, and invited him to work on an orderly transition.
Mr Giammattei's rule saw several anti-graft prosecutors arrested or forced into exile. He has also cracked down on critical journalists.
Mr Arevalo will be sworn in on 14 January 2024 as corruption, poverty and gang violence disillusion the nation of 17 million people, pushing thousands to emigrate in search of better lives, many to the US. 
""You can no longer live anywhere, because there is so much crime,"" 66-year-old housewife Maria Rac, an Indigenous Mayan, told AFP news agency.
Mr Arevalo has received congratulatory messages from the ambassadors of the US and the EU and the presidents of neighbouring Mexico and El Salvador.
His victory ""means a defeat of the old politics"" and marks a new era for Guatemala, independent analyst Miguel Angel Sandoval told AFP.
However, attacks against Arevalo will likely continue, says Risa Grais-Targow, an analyst at political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group.
""The ruling pact will likely continue to target electoral officials and Arevalo's Semilla party with investigations ahead of January's change in government,"" she said.
Mr Arevalo will be leading a nation that is in a ""very complicated"" state, said Ana María Méndez, director for Central America at think tank Washington Office On Latin America.
""I see it more as a transition government, to restore the democratic values that have been broken in Guatemala,"" she said.

Cuban priest's fight to claim asylum in UK,"Father Juan hopes to set up a church for Ukrainian refugees in Worcestershire
At a glance
Father Juan Carballosa and his family came to the UK from Cuba in October  
He said he had faced persecution after supporting anti-government protests 
A support group said his experience of struggling to find a lawyer to help in his case was ""all too common""
The Home Office said all asylum seekers were entitled to legal representation and that it was investing heavily to speed up the processing of applications
A Cuban priest seeking asylum in the UK says he has been unable to find a solicitor to help his case despite efforts over the past 10 months.
Father Juan Carballosa and his family left Cuba in October 2022. 
He said they had faced threats after he spoke in solidarity with anti-government protesters. 
While the Home Office said all asylum seekers were entitled to legal representation, the Law Society said it was ""very difficult"" for them to secure a lawyer.
""If I go back to Cuba... I'll go to jail,"" Father Juan Carballosa said. 
An orthodox priest, when thousands joined anti-government protests in country in 2021, he said he felt he could not stay silent. 
The protests, the largest in decades, led to a security crackdown that saw hundreds of people jailed.
Since arriving in the UK in October 2022, Father Juan's family have been living in Evesham 
""From this moment I continue to speak for freedom, because I see the real face of the Cuban government,"" he said.
At the time, the ruling Communist party banned the protests, which it said were a US-backed attempt at overthrowing the government. 
Father Juan said he was detained and questioned by police over the following year.
At times, he said his house and his family were surrounded by paramilitaries carrying knives and machetes. 
Father Juan said armed men waited outside his home in Cuba in November 2021 
The Carballosa family travelled to the UK in October 2022. 
But since initial screening interviews at Birmingham Airport, Father Juan said they had heard nothing about their case.
With his documentary evidence in Spanish, he said his family needed specialist legal help and translation. But has struggled to find a solicitor.
""Most of the time the answer is the same,"" he said. ""'We are very busy we cannot take any new cases at this moment.'""
Reverend David Haslam, from Evesham Vale Welcomes Refugees, has been trying to help find a solicitor
""It's all too common I'm afraid,"" said Reverend David Haslam, from the Evesham Vale Welcomes Refugees support group.
""We've got people who've been here since February last year. 
""Some of them have been sent questionnaires [from the Home Office] to answer, but they need legal help for that.""
A spokesperson for the Home Office said all asylum seekers were entitled to legal representation - including with translation - through legal aid. 
The department added it was investing heavily in a bid to speed up the processing of applications.
Richard Miller, head of Justice at the Law Society, said the number of solicitors providing immigration work had dropped significantly in recent years.
""The position has been made a lot worse because the rates the government pays for this work have not been increased since the 1990s,"" he said.

Chandrayaan-3: India's lunar lander Vikram searches for safe Moon landing spot,"India's space agency has released images of the far side of the Moon as its third lunar mission attempts to locate a safe landing spot near the little-explored south pole.
The pictures have been taken by Vikram, Chandrayaan-3's lander, which began the last phase of its mission on Thursday.
Vikram, which carries a rover in its belly, is due to land on 23 August.
The photos come a day after Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft crashed into the Moon after spinning out of control.
The craft - Russia's first Moon mission in nearly 50 years - was due to be the first ever to land on the south pole, but failed after encountering problems as it moved into its pre-landing orbit.
On Monday morning, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said the lander from Chandrayaan-3, which is due to touch down on Wednesday at 18:04 India time (12:34 GMT), has been mapping the landing area and taking images with its ""hazard detection and avoidance"" camera. 
Isro added that the black-and-white images sent by this camera will assist them ""in locating a safe landing area - without boulders or deep trenches"".
The lunar far side is the side that faces away from the Earth and is sometimes also called ""the dark side of the Moon"" because so little is known about it. Scientists say landing there can be a tricky affair.
But there's a lot of interest in this part of the Moon which scientists think could hold frozen water and precious elements. 
Isro said on Sunday that the lander module had been successfully lowered into an orbit closer to the Moon (of 25km by 134km) and is now waiting for the lunar Sun-rise to land. 
If Chandrayaan-3 is successful, India will be first to land near the lunar south pole. It will also be only the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.
The third in India's programme of lunar exploration, Chandrayaan-3 is expected to build on the success of its earlier Moon missions.
It comes 15 years after the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime.
Chandrayaan-2 - which also comprised an orbiter, a lander and a rover - was launched in July 2019 but it was only partially successful. Its orbiter continues to circle and study the Moon even today, but the lander-rover failed to make a soft landing and crashed during touchdown.
Isro chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath has said that the space agency had carefully studied the data from its crash and carried out simulation exercises to fix the glitches in Chandrayaan-3, which weighs 3,900kg and cost 6.1bn rupees ($75m; £58m). The lander module weighs about 1,500kg, including the 26kg-rover Pragyaan. 
The south pole of the Moon is still largely unexplored - the surface area that remains in shadow there is huge, and scientists say it means there is a possibility of water in areas that are permanently shadowed.
One of the major goals of Chandrayaan-3 is to hunt for water ice, which scientists say could support human habitation on the Moon in future. It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations.

Ecuador divided after bloody election campaign,"The assassination of Fernando Villavicencio upended the final week of campaigning in Ecuador. 
All eight candidates talked about the need for peace and security - and after an often bloody campaign, that was a message that Ecuadoreans very much wanted to hear.
After Mr Villavicencio's death, a local politician was killed in the northern Esmeraldas province and many feared more was to come. 
Thankfully, Sunday's elections passed off without incident, but no candidate had enough support to avoid a run-off. 
That brings yet more uncertainty as campaigning ramps up again ahead of October.
Leftist candidate Luisa Gonzalez took 33% of the votes, pledging generous social welfare programmes. 
Her victory didn't come as a surprise - she was always the frontrunner.
But the second-place candidate was less expected. Young businessman Daniel Noboa won 24% of the votes after a good performance in the last debate.
As Ecuadoreans cast their vote on Sunday, security was top of the agenda.
""Things are very complicated,"" says 33-year-old personal trainer Priscila Jaramillo. ""After the death of Villavicencio, I think that we need to unite.""
Experts agree that the brutal campaign has changed the views of many people here.
""Violence is a feeling for the voter,"" says political analyst Pedro Donoso. ""The reality of living in a country where authorities are murdered, a candidate has been assassinated - that could have been an important factor in deciding who to vote for.""
Fernando Villavicencio's daughters, Tamia and Amanda, went to the polls on Sunday dressed in white. It was a message to those who killed their father that they will honour his legacy of campaigning for peaceful change in the country.
A thick dark blue line was painted across Tamia's face, made with ink from the huito fruit - a traditional face-painting among indigenous communities in Ecuador.
""It's used for celebrations and battles, and today we're standing strong and coming to exercise a right that has been abused because they took away one of our presidential candidates,"" says Tamia. 
""For me, this is a battle. We are fighting with our pen in our hand.""
Her sister Amanda says the death of her father, whom she considered a best friend, has been a wake-up call for many Ecuadoreans.
""He was beautiful, powerful, kind - a giant,"" she says. 
""We're living a powerful historic moment here in Ecuador. So many of my friends, people of my age who used to spoil their votes, people who didn't care about politics are upset - and they're thinking, if I don't do something for my country, for myself, then nothing will change, the mafia will come and dominate us,"" adds Amanda.
Beyond violence, though, there's another powerful force at play here in Ecuador - ""correismo"".
The political movement started with leftist populist president Rafael Correa - a politician who spent on education and health programme. He later got caught up in corruption scandals and is now exiled in Belgium. 
But he remains a huge political force in Ecuador.
Luisa González is the protégé of Mr Correa - she is the vote for ""correismo"". 
Meanwhile, Daniel Noboa will get the vote from those who want to draw a line under Mr Correa and who blame the former president for much of Ecuador's woes.
""Ecuador remains divided between two axes,"" says Sebastian Mantilla Baca, executive director of the Latin American Centre of Political Studies in Quito. 
""It's likely that the vote of the other candidates will go towards Noboa as an alternative to 'correismo'. But if he doesn't manage to get solid support in the National Assembly, then that will create obstacles from the opposition.""
This country is divided politically, but the search for peace and security unites Ecuadoreans - and that will be at the heart of campaigning as the country heads to a second round.

Pakistan president denies approving laws giving military more power,"Pakistan's President Arif Alvi denied approving two controversial bills which further enhance the military's powers. 
In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Sunday, he said he returned the bills unsigned but his staff ""undermined my will"".
The two laws make it an offence to reveal the identities of military intelligence officers and also propose jail terms for defaming the army. 
Mr Alvi's statement could call the legality of the two laws into question. 
However, Pakistan's interim law minister Ahmed Irfan Aslam told reporters that under the constitution, the president had the option of either giving assent to the bills, or referring them to parliament with ""specific observations"".
Instead, Dr Alvi ""purposely delayed the assent"", and returned the bills with neither assent nor observations, he said.
Mr Aslam added that since the signed bills were not received from the president even after 10 days, they automatically became law. 
A gazette from the Senate Secretariat stated that they were ""deemed to have been assented to by the president"".
The disputed bills were sent to President Alvi before parliament was dissolved on 9 August, with the aim of holding elections in November. 
However, the polls have been postponed until February as the electoral commission says electoral boundaries must be redrawn to reflect fresh census data, a months-long process, before polls can be held.
The country is currently under a caretaker government. 
Earlier this month, the Of­­ficial Secrets (Amend­m­ent) Bill and the Pakistan Army (Amend­ment) Bill provoked bitter debate in the National Assembly. 
The former bill recommends a three-year jail term and a fine of up to 10 million rupees (£27,000 ; $34,000) for anyone who discloses the identity of an intelligence official, informant or source, while the latter imposes a jail term of up to five years on anyone who discloses sensitive information relating to national security. 
Both the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the coalition partners of the the ruling Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) called the government out for passing ""draconian laws in haste"" and without discussion.
The laws have already been used to arrest some opposition members. PTI vice chair Shah Mehmood Qureshi was arrested over the weekend under the Official Secrets Act. 
The PTI claimed that Mr Qureshi was detained for holding a press conference where he challenged the postponement of the election. Authorities accuse him of leaking the contents of a secret diplomatic cable for political gain. 
The Pakistani intelligence services are regularly accused of illegally detaining opposition members, politicians, activists and journalists, with human rights organisations noting the increasing number of enforced disappearances every month.
The PTI has also said that it will take the disputed bills to the Supreme Court, and declared its ""complete support"" for the president.
Mr Alvi is a founding member of the PTI, led by former prime minister Imran Khan. Mr Khan's arrest in May saw violent protests that also targeted military cantonments. Since then, the party has been systematically targeted, with many key leaders, including Mr Khan, given jail sentences over a variety of charges.

Ghana's Paa Kwesi Asare wins 2023 BBC News Komla Dumor Award,"Ghanaian TV presenter and journalist Paa Kwesi Asare has won the 2023 BBC News Komla Dumor Award.  
The 36-year-old is the eighth recipient of the award and the first to come from Ghana, like the late Komla Dumor.
Asare is currently the head of business news at Ghana's private TV3 channel, where he has worked for seven years as one of its main news anchors.
The award was created to honour Dumor, a presenter for BBC World News, who died suddenly aged 41 in 2014.
He had worked tirelessly to bring a more nuanced African narrative to the world, representing a confident, savvy and entrepreneurial side of Africa.
The judges were impressed by Asare's strong journalism and his ability to explain complex topics compellingly and clearly.
""This for me is a watershed moment in my career and an opportunity I'll grab with both hands,"" said Asare, who will spend three months working with BBC News teams in London across TV, radio and online. 
The Ghanaian broadcaster will also receive training and be mentored by leading BBC journalists. 
As part of the placement, he will travel to a country in Africa to report on a story that will be broadcast to the BBC's global audiences. 
""I feel very elated to have won the BBC News Komla Dumor Award,"" Asare said.
""This is arguably the most prestigious award for any African journalist. Komla's talent is one that I greatly admired and to be found worthy of walking in his shoes is not only a joy but also a great privilege.""
Previous award recipients are Dingindaba Jonah Buyoya, Victoria Rubadiri, Solomon Serwanjja, Waihiga Mwaura, Amina Yuguda, Didi Akinyelure and Nancy Kacungira, the inaugural winner. 
Last year, Buyoya travelled to the Seychelles to report on how the country's ocean plants can help tackle climate change.

This page was edited by me, Brandon Livesay and George Bowden. It was written by Barbara Tasch, Brandon Drenon, Heather Sharp, Ece Goksedef, Jacqueline Howard and Malu Cursino.
You can read more about the flooding caused by Storm Hilary in our latest story here.
The first tropical storm to hit southern California since 1939 came and went on Monday, carving a path of destruction as it tracked north-northwest through Nevada. 
Post-Tropical Cyclone Hilary is now predicted to head toward Idaho, Oregon and Montana where flood watches are in effect until Tuesday morning. 
Here are a few key moments from today: 
These aerial photos give a sense of the scale of the damage caused by the sudden heavy rains in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs, in California.
Mud and floodwaters have completely engulfed part of the Interstate 10 highway.
The wettest August day on record in California used to be 46 years ago, way back in 1977... until Storm Hilary arrived. 
Now, the wettest day is 20 August 2023.
On Sunday, eight cities in the Golden State received record-breaking August rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.
Palm Springs had 3.18in (8.07cm), surpassing the previous record of 2.03in (5.16cm). 
And in Cuyamaca, 4.11in (10.43cm) of rain fell, well above its previous August record of 2.61in (6.63cm).
Flooding over the typically dry and barren landscape has caused mudflows, trapped cars and closed several roads.
The worst of the storm is over for Los Angeles, yet the city is still urging residents to stay home and stay safe. 
Flooding and strong winds downed trees and powerlines and caused a few road closures, some of which have yet to re-open.
Los Angeles Police Department responded to 125 car crashes, according to the latest city update, though no fatal or ""significant injuries"" were reported. 
All public schools in Los Angeles school district were closed on Monday. The city has announced more than a dozen ""grab-and-go"" meal distribution sites for families with students. 
Los Angeles officials said the city has also opened the most emergency temporary shelters for its homeless population ""since at least 2020"".
Thunderbird Country Club in Rancho Mirage, California, has been severely hit by the storm.
Mud and debris have covered parts of the greens and cut off passage across a bridge, and tree branches and pieces of wood litter the area. 
Several roads and businesses remain closed today after Storm Hilary drenched the area with record rainfall overnight. 
At the peak of the storm, residents living in Palm Springs who tried to call 911 - the emergency services line in the US - could not get through. 
They were directed to text 911 or call non-emergency lines, Palm Springs mayor Grace Garner said this morning at 04:00 local time.After hours without having the ability to dial 911 for help amid the historic storm, officials have notified residents that emergency calls are now being directed to the Palm Springs Police Department call centre. 
The 911 phone lines in the area are back up and running.
Cities and towns in the path of Storm Hilary are ""quite vulnerable"" and have soil that ""cannot handle"" heavy rain, according to Jamie Rhome - who oversees the National Hurricane Centre's Storm Surge Unit.
Rhome says the rain has hit areas that were previously scorched by wildfires, which meant the soil was virtually like a slick ""pavement"".
You can hear more from Rhome in the video below.
Climate change is in large parts responsible for this storm, says prof Kathleen Treseder, from the University of California, Irvine's Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department.
It increases the frequency and intensity of the El Niño weather phenomenon, which leads to warmer waters in the Pacific Ocean and ultimately generates suitable conditions for these storms.
""This is a 100 year storm and we're getting a lot of 100 year events here,"" Treseder says, adding that more events of this scope are to be expected in coming years. 
""Whenever we have an extreme event like this now I tell myself this is not gonna be a one-off, likely we are gonna have more and it may even be worse,"" she says.
The National Weather Service has issued advisories this morning for three more tropical storms which are developing across the Atlantic and heading towards the US.
Tropical Storm Franklin is currently located over the eastern Caribbean sea.
Several hundred miles further to the east is Tropical Storm Gert.
According to the NWS, signs of showers and thunderstorms have already begun over the Gulf of Mexico.
""Tropical storm warnings or watches are likely to be issued later today,"" the NWS has said.
The third event, Tropical Storm Emily, is roughly 1,100 (1700km) miles west off Africa's Cabo Verde islands. 
As it moves west, it may form into a storm that reaches US shores ""later this week"", the NWS says. 
Officials warn another storm could potentially develop south of Mexico in the Pacific over the next few days and move north towards the US. 
We're now seeing more of the damage caused by Storm Hilary.
These pictures show a large eucalyptus tree which fell over last night in Sun Valley, California.
Parts of the tree crashed on to two cars parked in front of a house and damaged a metal fence.
Several trees and power lines were toppled as winds swept across the region over the last few hours.
A number of roads also remain closed and flooding continues after the storm brought record-breaking rainfall overnight.
Isabelle Gerretsen
BBC Future Planet journalist
US states, including Vermont, have been restoring flood plains and wetlands to
increase their resistance to flooding.
Vermont has also been purchasing
flood-prone properties in a bid to move homeowners to
higher ground. 
Texas, meanwhile, has launched
a state-wide plan to assess its vulnerability to
flooding and review which projects could prevent damage. 
In Houston, climate-resilient
homes are protecting residents from extreme flooding caused by hurricanes
and storm water run-off.
Other towns, such as Valmeyer, in Illinois, have
opted to relocate and rebuild in the wake of devastating floods.  
We've just heard from Sean Heslin, who lives in Palm
Springs.
Here's what Sean had to say:
Tropical Storm Hilary was slow to arrive in Palm Springs but
when she got here, she came with a bang.
In fewer than 12 hours, Hilary brought the greater Palm Springs
area between 3-4 inches of rain, nearly one third of our annual expected rainfall.
Many local roads flooded within the first hour. All our phones were buzzing
with flash flood alerts throughout the day and well into the night.
During the heaviest rains yesterday, many residents spent hours sweeping water
away from doorways to prevent their homes from flooding. 
Another concern for many residents were pools overflowing. Many
folks used large buckets to try and displace pool water.
Waking up at 06:15 this morning, I saw typical bright sunshine
and some beautiful cloud formations, but also multiple emails and texts from
Palm Springs Police Department. 
Every major road in and out of Palm Springs,
including the I-10 freeway, has been shut down for 30 miles surrounding.
Local police are still recommending we all stay home and off the roads.
Regan Morris
Reporting from Los Angeles, California
The rain has now stopped in Hollywood and damage has been
limited to some power outages and a few downed trees.
LA fires chief, Kristin
Crowley, said there were no significant reports of damage in Los Angeles and no loss of life. 
The 5 freeway is gridlocked with traffic due to flooding, but in the Hollywood Hills, the situation was normal. 
A handful of tourists
were hiking to get a glimpse of the famous Hollywood sign, which was no longer
shrouded in clouds. 
Hilary was previously a category four hurricane with wind speeds hitting 145mph (233km/h).
Since arriving on US shores, it has gone from a tropical storm to a post-tropical cyclone. 
But what is a post-tropical cyclone?
Well, it's a ""cyclone that no longer possesses sufficient tropical characteristics"", according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which, among other things, means that its core temperature has dropped. 
However, this does not mean that the storm has lost strength. 
In 2012, Hurricane Sandy was a post-tropical storm by the time it reached New Jersey but still had 80mph (128km/h) winds and brought several inches of rain.
Normally hot and dry, the desert town of Palm Springs was one of the areas hardest hit by Tropical Storm Hilary.
Footage shows flooding and mudflows covering the streets as abandoned cars floated in flood water. 
Roads were closed and downed powerlines left thousands without electricity. 
""Our 911 lines are down at the moment,"" Palm Springs mayor Grace Garner told NBC on this morning, adding ""it's a huge concern.""
The previous single-day record for rainfall in Palm Springs, recorded in 1930, was 2.03in (5.15cm).
On Sunday, 3.18in of rain fell across the dusty landscape. 
Peter Bowes
Reporting from Santa Clarita, California
After a night of epic rain and little sleep, the storm
has finally gone. 
We were pummelled by a relentless downpour in Santa
Clarita, 32 miles (50km) north of Los Angeles, which saw record levels for a 24-hour
period.
But, for the most part, the view outside is remarkably normal. It's
like, ""did that really happen?"" 
There is some flooding and road closures, but
the summer heat is drying the streets quickly. 
With such a vast amount of rain
in what is usually the year's driest month, the events of the past few hours
have created an interesting paradigm for the traditionally parched countryside. 
The sun and searing heat will be back very soon. 
It remains to be seen how this
extraordinary event impacts the enduring wildfire season.  
The weeds will
grow but nothing is going to burn, at least for a short while. 
The eye of the storm has now moved into Nevada. 
Several areas in the state are under flood watch warnings until Monday evening, including Las Vegas. 
Flash flooding also remains a risk for the area, the National Weather Service said.
Nevada Governor Joe Lombardo declared a state of emergency on Sunday.
Throughout the day the storm is expected to continue moving north, where forecasters predict moderate
to heavy rain may also create flooding.
Currently under flood watch are parts of south-east California, Arizona, Utah, Oregon and Idaho.
""Virtually all"" daily rainfall records in Los Angeles have been broken, the National Weather Service says.
The highest rainfall total was recorded in Lewis Ranch, in the mountainous region, with a total of 7 inches (nearly 18 cm) in the last 48 hours.
The highest wind gusts were 87mph (140km/h) in the area of the Western San Gabriel Mountains, recorded about 3am Monday.

Kelso Cochrane: Trying to unlock the secrets of a 64-year-old racist murder,"The family of a black man murdered in 1959 is demanding access to the police file on his unsolved killing.
Kelso Cochrane was stabbed to death on a west London street, in what's believed to have been a racist attack. Nobody was ever charged with the crime.
The Metropolitan Police says the file is not available to the public because the case is still open.
The family lawyer says this secrecy is not justified, and the family is ready to take legal action if necessary.
The murder is arguably one of the most significant events in black British history.
At the time of his death, the 32-year-old was living in London, working as a carpenter and planning to study law. 
Kelso Cochrane had been born in Antigua, and had arrived in England five years before his death, following a spell in the US. He had been married there, but the relationship had broken down.  
Listen to the radio documentary, The Murder of Kelso Cochrane, on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Monday 21 August, or 11:00 BST on Wednesday 23 August, or afterwards on BBC Sounds
He had also left two young daughters in the US, to whom he still sent toys - dolls, tea sets, and skipping ropes. One of them, Josephine, says that these ""little things"" gave her ""the impression that he was a loving father and that he cared"". 
Like many other members of the Windrush generation, Cochrane was living in the west London area of Notting Hill. It was one of the few parts of the city where new immigrants from the Caribbean could find housing, although it was often expensive, overcrowded and in poor condition. The area was also home to a well-established white working class population.
On the evening of 16 May 1959, Cochrane paid a visit to his local hospital, Paddington General. His thumb was painful after an injury at work.
On his way back home, he was attacked by a group of five or six white youths. Witnesses said they saw them encircling him, kicking, hitting. One jumped on his back.
Two Jamaican men walking past saw the incident and ran to help. Cochrane was able to stand, so they got him into a taxi and took him to St Charles' Hospital in nearby North Kensington. 
Cochrane didn't seem to be bleeding heavily, but he'd been stabbed in the heart with a thin blade. By the time they arrived at the hospital, he was in severe shock. He died there, just before 01:00.
By 04:00 news of the death had made the newspapers. A late edition of the Sunday Express that morning carried a flash headline: ""Murder in Notting Hill"".
Notting Hill had already become identified with racial tension. In the previous summer of 1958, riots lasting several days had broken out in the neighbourhood.
The riots ended in early September, but for black residents the undercurrent of violence persisted.
Far-right groups had become active in the area, including the Union Movement of Sir Oswald Mosley. In spring 1959, another group, the White Defence League, had set up an office in the heart of Notting Hill, saying it would ""campaign for white interests"".
But for all the tension, nobody had been killed in a racist attack - until Kelso Cochrane.
The police inquiry was led by Det Supt Ian Forbes-Leith. He had a team of 20 officers at his disposal.
The investigation quickly focused on a party, which had been taking place close to where Cochrane was attacked on Southam Street. 
Several guests were brought in for questioning. Two were held for more than 48 hours - Patrick Digby, a 20-year-old merchant seaman, and John ""Shoggy"" Breagan who was 24. They were later released without charge.
The police were quick to dismiss the idea that racism was the motive. Det Supt Forbes-Leith told the press that the stabbing had ""absolutely nothing to do with racial conflict"". He suggested the motive could have been robbery.
That wasn't what it looked like to many in Notting Hill's black community. John Prince, a friend of Cochrane, told the BBC in 2006 that it had been frightening: ""Suddenly now you're faced with the possibility of being murdered just because of who you were as a person.""
On 6 June 1959 hundreds of people - black and white - gathered for Cochrane's funeral, lining the streets of Notting Hill, following his coffin to nearby Kensal Green Cemetery.

Footage of Kelso Cochrane's funeral in June 1959
In the wake of the murder, the activist Claudia Jones and others set up the Inter Racial Friendship Co-ordinating Council, which paid Cochrane's funeral costs, organised silent protests in Whitehall, and pushed for laws against racial hatred.
Over time, the police inquiry was wound down. 
Decades later in 2006, Cochrane's older brother Stanley came to England for the first time. He wanted to find out who killed his brother. A BBC documentary team followed him. 
The investigative journalist Mark Olden tracked down Patrick Digby and John Breagan but neither were willing to meet Stanley. Both denied involvement in the murder. Stanley asked to see the police file but was only allowed to see an abridged version.
Among those who saw the programme was Pat Digby's step-daughter, Susie Read. She contacted Olden, and told him she remembered Digby's friends baiting him with an odd name - ""Oslo"" or ""Kelso"".
She has now told us that once during an argument, she had challenged Digby about the accusation: ""He said, 'Well, if I did, you could never prove it.' I said, 'Did you kill him? He said, 'Yeah'.""
Digby died in 2007.
Olden kept digging. He spoke to a guest at the Southam Street party, who told him Digby had come back after the attack, and confessed to people there.
He spoke again to John Breagan, who said that he and Digby had left the party together before the murder. When first asked why by the police, one of them said it was to look for girls, the other said it was to have a fight. But when detained in the police station, they were held in adjacent cells. Breagan told Olden that this had allowed them to ""straighten"" their stories. Breagan died in 2019.
In 2011 Olden published a book, Murder in Notting Hill, which prompted Kelso Cochrane's daughter Josephine to contact him. Growing up in New York, she knew her father had died, but until then hadn't realised he'd been murdered.
Josephine is now at the centre of the family's efforts to get the police files opened. She told us that as she hadn't known her father growing up she wanted to know ""everything"" about his murder and the investigation ""before I die"".
The investigation file into Kelso Cochrane's murder has been transferred to the National Archives in Kew, but it will remain closed from public view until 2054 - after Josephine's 100th birthday.
It's not uncommon for unsolved murder cases to be restricted for up to 100 years - this is so they only become public after all those involved have died.
But some unsolved murder files from London in the same period are open, such as that of Freda Knowles, murdered in 1964, or Ernest Isaacs, shot dead at his home in 1966.
Crime historian Dr Mark Roodhouse, of the University of York, uses police files from the mid-20th Century for his research. He says he's surprised that the Kelso Cochrane file is still restricted.
In spring 2020, I made my own Freedom of Information request for the Cochrane file to be opened early, on public interest grounds. 
I've succeeded in getting other files opened early, notably dozens of files on institutional child sex abuse just after the Jimmy Savile scandal.
On this occasion, however, my request was turned down.
The Met Police said then the Cochrane case was considered open, and that ""new scientific techniques"" meant that ""cases hitherto considered unsolvable, are being examined afresh"".
I was also told that releasing the files would cause the family ""immediate mental distress"". However, it is Cochrane's family who now wants the file released. 
What's more, the main suspects are dead and it is difficult to point to any evidence that could be subject to ""cold case"" techniques. The BBC documentary team was told in 2006 that Kelso Cochrane's clothes had been destroyed in the late 1960s.
We went back to the Metropolitan Police this summer, asking them to explain why the Cochrane family was unable to access the file. They told us that ""as with all unsolved murders this case is not closed and any evidence that comes to light will be assessed and investigated accordingly"".
They said that officers from the Special Casework Team had made efforts to engage with Mr Cochrane's family, via their legal representatives, with a view to discussing details of this murder investigation - but that these efforts had so far been unsuccessful. 
Daniel Machover, the lawyer acting for the Cochrane family, says the family will pursue a formal route to obtain the file - challenging the reasons previously given to withhold it. 
He has obtained multiple statements to support the request, from Kelso Cochrane's immediate and extended family, and from journalists who have tried to obtain the file over many years, including myself.
Machover has also provided the death certificates of the key suspects, and others who are likely to have been significant witnesses in the case.
He says it's too late for criminal justice, but the family hopes there will be something in the file that ""at least gives them a picture, a flavour, an idea of what was done to try to secure a criminal charge and a criminal prosecution"".
Machover has represented many black families in dispute with the Met Police. He believes there is a need to acknowledge the events of the past to deal with mistrust today.
Comparisons have been drawn with the murder of the south London teenager, Stephen Lawrence, in 1993 - in both cases, there was a reluctance by the Met Police to name racism as the motive, and an initial failure to charge anyone for the crimes. 
Less than a mile from where he was attacked, a street has been named after Kelso Cochrane, as well as a new block of social housing. 
Members of the Cochrane family are grateful for the recognition but they still want something more. 
Millicent Christian, the daughter of Cochrane's cousin, says that Stephen Lawrence's mother Doreen eventually achieved ""some kind"" of justice. ""We're looking for that same kind of justice for our Kelso.""

Maiden Pharmaceuticals: Fury in The Gambia over India cough syrup deaths,"In September last year, Ebrima Sajnia watched helplessly as his young son slowly died in front of his eyes.
Mr Sajnia, who works as a taxi driver in The Gambia, says three-year-old Lamin was set to start attending nursery school in a few weeks when he got a fever. A doctor at a local clinic prescribed medicines, including a cough syrup, but the feverish child refused to take them.
""I forced Lamin to drink the syrup,"" recalls Mr Sajnia, sitting at his home in Banjul, capital of The Gambia.
Over the next few days, Lamin's condition deteriorated as he struggled to eat and even urinate. He was admitted to a hospital, where doctors detected kidney issues. Within seven days, Lamin was dead.
He was among around 70 children - younger than five - who died in The Gambia of acute kidney injuries between July and October last year after consuming one of four cough syrups made by an Indian company called Maiden Pharmaceuticals. 
In October, the World Health Organization (WHO) linked the deaths to the syrups, saying it had found ""unacceptable"" levels of toxins in the medicines.
A Gambian parliamentary panel also concluded after investigations that the deaths were the result of the children ingesting the syrups. 
Both Maiden Pharmaceuticals and the Indian government have denied this - India said in December that the syrups complied with quality standards when tested domestically.
It's an assessment that Amadou Camara, chairperson of the Gambian panel that investigated the deaths, strongly disagrees with.
""We have evidence. We tested these drugs. [They] contained unacceptable amounts of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, and these were directly imported from India, manufactured by Maiden,"" he says. Ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol are toxic to humans and could be fatal if consumed.
It's a difficult situation for The Gambia, one of Africa's smallest countries, which imports most of its medicines from India. Some bereaved parents say they don't trust Indian-made drugs anymore.
""When I read that a medicine is from India, I barely touch it,"" said Lamin Danso, who lost his nine-month-old son.
But the reliance on Indian drugs is unlikely to change anytime soon.
""Most pharmacists are still bringing in drugs from India - it's far cheaper than importing drugs from America or Europe,"" says journalist Mustapha Darboe.
India is the world's largest exporter of generic drugs, meeting much of the medical needs of developing countries. But allegations that its drugs have caused tragedies like the one in The Gambia - and in other countries such as Uzbekistan and the US - have raised questions about manufacturing practices and quality standards. 
""If you see the tragedy, and the kind of alerts declared by WHO, so many countries are thinking twice. They are regularly enquiring. It's not very comfortable. I call it an aberration. It's a costly aberration,"" says Udaya Bhaskar, director general of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India.
He says while incidents like the one in The Gambia and Uzbekistan have ""made a dent"" on the Indian pharmaceutical industry's image, it hasn't impacted exports.
India exported medicines worth $25.4bn (£20bn) in the financial year ending in March 2023 - of these, $3.6bn was to countries in Africa. Mr Bhaskar points out that the country has already exported drugs worth more than $6bn in the first quarter of the current financial year.
But India has announced steps such as making it compulsory for companies to get cough syrup samples tested at government-approved laboratories before exporting. The Gambia, which does not have drug testing laboratories, has also made this mandatory for medicines exported from India since July.
India has also set deadlines for its pharma companies to adopt WHO-standard good manufacturing practices.
But some Indian activists allege that the country has had a ""two-tier manufacturing system"" for a long time.
""What we export to the US and Europe, we try and use much more stringent standards compared to drugs made for local consumption and exported to less regulated markets,"" alleges Dinesh Thakur, a public health activist.
Mr Bhaskar disagrees, saying that several countries in Africa - India's third-largest export destination - have ""robust"" regulatory mechanisms.
A recent Gambian government report on the tragedy has recommended the establishment of a quality control laboratory and two drug regulators have been dismissed.
""We know the anger in the society. We know the anger among the victims,"" says Billay G Tunkara, the majority leader of the Gambian National Assembly and head of government business.
But devastated parents say nothing has changed in the country's health sector over the past year - the medical system struggled to cope with the influx of fever cases and some parents were forced to raise funds to send their children to neighbouring Senegal.
Momodou Dambelleh, who sells wood for a living, was one of them. He last saw Aminata, his 22-month-old daughter, on a video call as she lay unresponsive on a hospital bed.
""I could only see her head moving. I was trying to let her know it was me, her papa,"" he says. That was shortly before she died.
""Those who committed the crime, including the health minister, should face the full force of the law,"" says Ebrima EF Saidy, spokesperson for a group representing the parents of the victims. 
Dr Ahmadou Lamin Samateh, health minister of the Gambia, did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview.
A year on, many of the parents say they are determined to make sure that others in The Gambia don't have to experience such pain again.
The families of 19 children have sued local health officials and Maiden Pharmaceuticals in the Gambian high court. They say they won't hesitate to approach Indian and international courts as well if needed.
""The government's negligence made the children die,"" says Mr Sagnia, who is part of the group.
This is the first in a two-part series.

Zimbabwe election: Chicken and chips put a taste for democracy to the test,"Free fried chicken and an endorsement from an unbeaten former world boxing champion have formed part of the intriguing choreography of election campaigning in Zimbabwe.
Nonetheless, finger-licking crowds and cheers for US boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr have not distracted from fundamental concerns about the polls themselves and fears of vote rigging in the first election since the death of Robert Mugabe, the man who dominated Zimbabwean politics for decades before being ousted by his deputy, Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, in 2017.
Wednesday's vote will see President Mnangagwa, the candidate of the ruling Zanu-PF party, being challenged by Nelson Chamisa of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) and nine other contenders.
A small online civic society group says it is gearing up to do what it can to protect the vote, which sees 6.62 million registered voters also choosing MPs and local councillors.  
Team Pachedu will be using an app called Mandla, meaning strength, to help monitor ""hotspots"" it feels Zanu-PF ""takes advantage of"" - a reference to a belief that the ruling party's long stay in power has been the result of rigging. 
""It is a strategy to track election results data as they come out of the polling stations, to see if they will tally with official results,"" Team Pachedu's co-ordinator Tafadzwa Sambiri told the BBC. The group is mostly made up of Zimbabwean activists based outside the country. 
Zanu-PF has persistently dismissed allegations that it steals elections.
""We as government have an obligation to be seen to be clean about this election,"" party spokesman Chris Mutsvangwa told the media recently. ""The president is working hard… reaching out for each vote."" 
Mr Mnangagwa is anxious to get an international stamp of approval so Zimbabwe's foreign debt can be restructured and potentially open up fresh lines of credit frozen more than 20 years ago.  
The ruling party itself has deep pockets. This was on display during the campaign, with the party dishing out fried chicken and chip meals from a popular fast food outlet and loaves of bread in packaging printed with ""VoteED"" - a reference to the president's initials.
Tens of thousands have flocked to the meetings lining up alongside trucks to receive the food. 
Zanu-PF, which has been in power since independence in 1980, denies that it is trying to buy votes, maintaining it is showing ""respect for people"" who have travelled from afar on buses by giving them food and water.  
Last month, Mayweather flew into the country aboard a private jet and at the behest of prominent gold dealer Scott Sakupwanya, an aspiring Zanu-PF MP for Mabvuku - an opposition stronghold in the capital, Harare.
After conducting some boxing drills in the constituency, Mayweather hosted a business dinner and then met Mr Mnangagwa at State House, where the two, in matching scarfs in the colours of the Zimbabwean flag, swapped presents, and he urged voters to back the president.
But behind such razzmatazz, human rights groups report that threats, intimidation and violence are on the rise.  
Zimbabwe Peace Project recorded 84 violations in the first two weeks of August, including the death of an opposition CCC supporter during an ambush by alleged ruling party activists.
Director Jestina Mukoko told the BBC that the main incidents had been arson, assaults, kidnapping threats and intimidation - all related to the elections and mainly perpetrated by Zanu-PF. 
State institutions had been complicit, with police violently breaking up and banning rallies, she said.
The police blame the opposition for conducting rallies outside agreed times and changing their routes - and say those linked to the death of the CCC supporter have been arrested.
Zanu-PF distanced itself from the violence, with Mr Mutsvangwa saying: ""A criminal who breaks law and order does not belong to a party. He is a criminal.""  
Mr Chamisa has decided to take part in the election despite reservations about its fairness.
He points out that promised reforms have not been implemented, including an audited voters' roll checked and signed off by all parties and equal access to state media. The Media Monitoring Project reports that Zanu-PF has had 62% of coverage, compared to 16% for CCC.
Monitors describe this as one of Zimbabwe's most litigious elections with more than 100 court cases related to the disqualification of mainly opposition candidates.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Douglas Mwonzora has urged the other opposition leaders to follow his lead and boycott the ""sham"" polls, decrying a predestined outcome. 
The party is still taking part in the parliamentary vote, although 87 of its candidates have been disqualified from running following a payment dispute with Zec.
Mr Mwonzora also accuses the electoral body of recently amending the law relating to postal voting, and changing boundaries at the last minute, meaning voters may not know their assigned polling station have changed.
Freeman Chari, co-ordinator of an activist monitoring group CredibleVote, says research has revealed glaring anomalies in the voters' roll with ""millions of people shifted from their traditional voting areas in opposition strongholds"".  
He told the BBC that in previous elections certain polling stations had reported dubious results, especially in Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central and Masvingo.
He gave Kanyemba, in rural Mashonaland Central Province, as an example, saying several areas there had recorded 100% voter registration and turnout rates - with more people casting their ballots than in other more densely populated areas.
Zec rejects the accusations as malicious. With 83% of those eligible to vote registered, chairperson Priscilla Chigumba says the commission is ready to conduct free and fair elections within the law. 
Team Pachedu is working with partners, observers and political parties to send volunteer agents to polling stations.
Its app is now live and available for agents to download. The group appealed for more volunteers to step up to protect the vote, especially in rural areas where the ruling party is dominant.  
""We also have image access [of certified voting return forms]. We don't want a situation as in 2018 when people went to the street and lives were lost, demanding to know the results,"" Mr Sambiri said.
It is the high cost of living and a lack of opportunities that have dominated the campaign.
Mr Chamisa's manifesto - A New Great Zimbabwe - pledges to restore opportunities and hope, as the country battles resurgent economic problems.
He plans to scrap the volatile local currency, tackle corruption and provide free education. 
President Mnangagwa did not produce a manifesto, saying his work speaks for itself.
While there is a boom in mining and agriculture and heavy investment in roads, dams and energy, the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans have barely changed. 
Inflation, which was in the single digits in late 2017 when he took over after Mr Mugabe was ousted, now stands at more than 100%.
He is also criticised by human rights groups for introducing repressive legislation and jailing critics.  
Several journalists, including from South African media, Al-Jazeera and Voice of America, have been refused accreditation in the last week, which has sparked condemnation.
But Mr Mnangagwa has urged observers to come ""with an open mind"" and without ""foregone conclusions"". 
""I want to make this clear; no-one is qualified to teach us democracy. We were never given our democracy on a silver platter,"" he said over the weekend.
""We fought for it. We acquired it ourselves.""

"Canada wildfires: At least 30,000 households in British Columbia told to evacuate","About 30,000 households have been ordered to evacuate in Canada's British Columbia province, where nearly 400 wildfires are raging.
Two huge fires in the Shuswap region merged overnight, destroying blocks of houses and other buildings.
To the south, travel to the waterside city of Kelowna has been restricted, and smoke from nearby fires hangs over Lake Okanagan.
Fires have charred homes in West Kelowna, a nearby city of 36,000.
The travel restriction around Kelowna is designed to ensure enough accommodation for evacuees and emergency workers. It also applies to the towns of Kamloops, Oliver, Penticton and Vernon and Osoyoos.
Hundreds of miles north, a huge fire continues to edge towards the city of Yellowknife.
An official deadline to evacuate the city - the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories - lapsed on Friday. A local official said later that day that nearly all residents had left, either by car or plane.
About 19,000 of the city's 20,000 inhabitants had evacuated. Authorities said 39 patients were moved out of a hospital to alternative facilities on Friday evening, making them the last people to be evacuated from the city. 
Environment and communities minister Shane Thompson said some people had chosen ""to shelter in place"", but urged locals to leave.
In British Columbia, evacuation orders grew from covering 15,000 homes on Friday to at least 30,000 by Saturday evening. Another 36,000 homes are under evacuation alert.
The province's emergency management minister said officials ""cannot stress strongly enough how critical it is to follow evacuation orders"". 
Bowinn Ma added: ""They are a matter of life and death not only for the people in those properties, but also for the first responders who will often go back to try to implore people to leave."" 
Premier of the province, David Eby, put the total number of people ordered to leave at 35,000, with 30,000 told to be prepared to evacuate. 
Canada is having its worst wildfire season on record, with at least 1,000 fires burning across the country, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
Experts say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
Extreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground - which can provide fuel for fires that can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.
Although no deaths have been reported in the latest fires, at least four firefighters have lost their lives during this record-breaking season.

Two men die swimming during County Cork triathlon,"At a glance
Two men die while taking part in an Ironman triathlon event in County Cork
The men - one aged in his 60s and the other in his 40s - got into difficulty during the swimming section
The organisers of the event, Ironman Ireland, says it is ""deeply saddened""
Two men have died while taking part of an Ironman triathlon event in Youghal, County Cork.
The men, one aged in his 60s and the other in his 40s, were participating in the swimming section when they got into difficulty in separate incidents.
They were removed from the water by the emergency services.
It is understood one of the men was Irish, but had been living in the UK, while the other was from Canada, Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported.
The men were taking part in an Ironman 70.3 event, also known as a half ironman. 
It typically involves a 1.2 mile (1.9km) swim, 56 mile (90.1km) cycle and a 13.1 mile (21.1km) run.
Gardaí (Irish police) said both men were pronounced dead by medical personnel and the local coroner has been notified. 
The organisers of the event, Ironman Ireland, said they were ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths.
""During the swim portion of Sunday's race, safety personnel provided immediate medical attention upon recognising the athletes were in need of assistance,"" it said.

""We share our greatest sympathies with the families and friends of the athletes and will continue to offer them our support as they go through this very difficult time.""
The triathlon was originally due to take place on Saturday but the schedule was disrupted by severe weather this weekend.
Storm Betty caused flooding and wind damage in several locations across the island of Ireland on Friday evening.
On Friday afternoon the organisers said they intended to move Saturday's swim course ""further into Youghal Bay, where the water is more protected"".
However, they later had to postpone the triathlon because the bike course was affected by flooding and storm debris.
On Saturday afternoon, the organisers said the race would go ahead on Sunday after Cork County Council helped to clear the course of debris.
They added that due to ""improving weather conditions"" the swim course would ""revert back to the original couse"".
Emergency response
Following the deaths, Cork County Council said it was currently offering ""every assistance required to the Ironman Group and all those impacted"".
""We wish to express our gratitude to the response agencies involved, including our dedicated fire and emergency personnel for their unwavering efforts during this difficult time,"" it added.
The triathlon event, which also features a full Ironman alongside the 70.3 event, continued on Sunday.

Niger coup leader Gen Tchiani promises to handover power in three years,"Niger's coup leader has promised to return the West African nation to civilian rule within three years.
Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani made the announcement after meeting mediators from the West African regional bloc Ecowas in the capital, Niamey.
Ecowas has threatened military action to reverse last month's overthrow of President Mohamed Bazoum if talks fail.
The junta head said that Niger did not want a war but would defend itself against any foreign intervention.
""If an attack were to be undertaken against us, it will not be the walk in the park some people seem to think,"" he warned in his televised address on Saturday evening.
Gen Tchiani also reiterated criticism of what he called the ""illegal and inhumane"" sanctions imposed by Ecowas on the landlocked country.
This has included cutting electricity, resulting in blackouts in Niamey and other major cities, as well as blocking crucial imports. 
Lorry drivers have been stuck for weeks waiting to bring in supplies, forcing up food prices.
""Sanctions are not conceived with the aim of finding a solution but to bring us to our knees and humiliate us,"" Gen Tchiani said.
Thousands of men came to a stadium in Niamey on Saturday to register for a volunteer force in case of invasion - although overcrowding prevented the registration process starting, the Reuters news agency reports.
Ecowas rejected the three-year timeframe after talks on Sunday.
""Ecowas is not accepting any prolonged transition again in the region. They just have to get ready to hand over in the shortest possible time,"" Abdel-Fatau Musah, the bloc's commissioner for political affairs, peace and security, told the BBC. 
He said the ""military aspect is very much on"". 
He added: ""The earlier they give power back to civilians and concentrate on their primary responsibility that is defending the territorial integrity of Niger, the better for them.""
Regional efforts to reverse the coup have been backed by the US and France, which both have military bases in Niger. These bases are part of efforts to tackle jihadist groups in the wider Sahel region.
The junta leader, who headed the presidential guard before seizing power on 26 July, said military intervention could worsen the Islamist insurgencies linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group.
""They seem ignorant to the fact that it is in large part thanks to the professionalism and valour of the defence and security forces of Niger that Niger has remained a barrier preventing terrorist hordes from destabilising the whole region,"" he said.
The coup mirrors similar recent takeovers in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali. 
And the influence of Russia in the wider Sahel region is also growing through its mercenary group Wagner.
Gen Tchiani did not give details about the handover of power, but said the principles for the transition would be decided within 30 days at a ""dialogue"" hosted by the coup leaders.
Their delegation was led by former Nigerian military leader Gen Abdulsalami Abubakar and also included Nigeria's most senior Muslim leader, the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa'adu Abubakar III.
He wields huge influence in Niger, part of which used to be in the Sokoto Caliphate, a powerful kingdom before colonial rule. 
Saturday's meeting was the first between leaders of the junta and Ecowas.

Baghdad advertising boards turned off over porn screening,"Iraqi officials have ordered all electronic advertising screens to be shut down in Baghdad after a hacker used one to show a pornographic film.
It happened at a major road junction in the Iraqi capital. Videos have been shared widely on social media.
A man has been arrested in connection with the incident, police say.
A statement said the suspect was a technician who had financial issues with the company that runs the advertising screens.
He was said to have acted in retaliation.
The hacker ""showed a pornographic film for several minutes before we cut the power cable"" on Saturday, a security source who requested anonymity told the AFP news agency.
These ""immoral scenes"" prompted the authorities to ""turn off all advertising screens in Baghdad"" while they review security measures, the same official explained. 
Screens in the capital - which are generally used to advertise products or politicians - were switched off on Sunday morning.

"Sara Sharif murder inquiry: Girl known to authorities, council says","A 10-year-old girl who was found dead in Surrey was known to the authorities, the county council has confirmed.
Sara Sharif's body was found at her family home in Woking early on 10 August, prompting a murder inquiry.
Surrey Police confirmed they wanted to speak to Sara's father Urfan Sharif, and his partner and brother who flew to Pakistan the day before she was found. 
Surrey County Council said it would ""work tirelessly"" to gain a ""full understanding"" of the situation.
Council leader Tim Oliver said previously the National Child Safeguarding Panel had been notified and a multi-agency review was under way.
""This Rapid Review will determine whether a Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review is to be undertaken by the Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership,"" Mr Oliver said.  
He explained: ""A Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review is a statutory process, bringing together partners including the police, health, social care and education to review practice of all agencies involved, organisational structures and learning.""
BBC News has been told two police teams in Jhelum, north Punjab in Pakistan, are looking for Mr Sharif.
District police officer Nasir Mehmood Bajwa, in Jhelum, told the BBC that after police find Mr Sharif they are likely to take him into custody after receiving the go-ahead from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in Islamabad.
Pakistan's foreign ministry and the FIA have not confirmed or shared any verbal or written orders on this case.
Mr Sharif, his partner Beinash Batool and his brother Faisal Malik all left the UK for Pakistan on 9 August, a day before Sara's body was discovered.
Surrey Police have said Mr Sharif, 41, made a 999 call from Pakistan shortly after landing in Islamabad with his partner, his brother and five children, aged between one and 13.
The call led officers to the house in Woking where they found the body of Sara who had sustained ""multiple and extensive injuries"", likely to have been caused over a sustained period of time. 
There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Pakistan.

Women's World Cup: Fans rejoice in Madrid as Spain makes football history,"""Girl power!"" exclaimed one woman as the final whistle blew and the fan zone erupted into screams and tears of joy.
There were so many children and young people in the crowd, their faces painted in the red and yellow of the Spanish flag.
This, presumably, was a moment many will remember for the rest of their lives.  
""We are especially happy to have had this experience with our baby daughter,"" one man said as he held his little girl who was wearing her very own Spain shirt. 
""They play as well as the men and they have to make the same effort. I think we have to give them more support and more sponsorship by the big companies.""
After all, he said, ""they give us the same joy"". 
Spain's victory is all the more remarkable for two reasons. 
First, the national side has been plagued by reports of a difficult relationship between some of the players and the coach, Jorge Vilda, a months-long feud that overshadowed preparations for the tournament. 
It was notable that every time Mr Vilda appeared in shot, there were audible boos and jeering from the watching fans.
And second, the Spanish team does not enjoy the same level of support as the men's side. 
This may be a football-mad country, but it was striking that there were few, if any, signs of support for the women in the bars, shops and restaurants that surround the fan zone. 
That, many felt here, might now change significantly in the wake of such a victory. 
""It's a beginning,"" said one young man. ""It's very important for me because my sister plays football.""
The Reds do enjoy the support of Spain's Queen Letizia, who was in Australia to watch the match with her football-playing daughter Sofia. 
There is much excitement in the Spanish media, after the Queen joined the players on the pitch, jumping together in celebration. And acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez tweeted that the team had ""made history"". 
Few here dared to dream. 
One woman said: ""I thought it was going to be England, actually.""

Ukraine war: Cumbrian man 'humbled' by messages from front line,"An air worker who moved to Ukraine has told of how front-line soldiers sent him video messages of thanks for the parcels they received.
Steve Hodgson, from Tebay, Cumbria, left the UK to join his fiancée Natasha and work for a charity in Ukraine.
He sent parcels to soldiers fighting in Bakhmut and said he received ""the most unbelievably amazing response.""
""These guys are doing the fighting and dying, and I'm just a delivery driver who goes nowhere near,"" he said.
Mr Hodgson has spent the last year delivering aid from the UK, including medical supplies for hospitals and nurseries.
He has since sold-up, quit his job as a tree surgeon and joined his fiancée in Odessa, in the south of the country.
Mr Hodgson, who has now travelled to Uzhhorod in Western Ukraine, has also recorded an audio diary for BBC Radio Cumbria.
The 52-year-old described the messages from the soldiers as ""very emotional and humbling to watch"".  
""[It was] short, nothing fancy, just a simple video from these guys, being bombed by Russia, as they speak to me, saying thank you for the boots, thank you for the clothes, thank you for the medicines. 
""It's incredibly emotional and incredibly hard to sometimes process.
""I will keep helping where I can and do everything I can - these guys are doing the fighting and dying. That makes every single little problem I encounter irrelevant.""

West Bank: Two Israelis killed in suspected Palestinian shooting near Hawara,"An Israeli father and son have been killed in a suspected Palestinian shooting attack in the occupied West Bank.
It happened near the village of Hawara - which has been the scene of previous deadly attacks on Israelis and rampages by Jewish settlers in retribution.  
The shooting took place at a carwash.  
The gunman is said to have approached on foot and opened fire with a handgun.  
The Israeli ambulance service said the two men aged 28 and 60 were pronounced dead at the scene. Both are said to have been civilians from Ashdod in southern Israel.
Israeli media reported that they had come to the West Bank to fix their car and spent several hours in Hawara.
They say that the attacker spoke to them briefly - maybe to check if they were Jewish Israelis - before shooting them at point blank range.  
The weapon was apparently found in a nearby field, and the suspect is still thought to be in the area.
The Israeli military has set up blockades nearby and is hunting for the gunman. It is also said to be on alert for reprisal attacks.
The Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad praised the deadly shooting.
Hawara has long been a flashpoint in the West Bank. It is located on a main road south of Nablus, which is mostly used by Palestinians and Israeli settlers.  
In the past, Israelis would sometimes shop there and come for services, which are often cheaper in Palestinian areas of the West Bank. But that has become uncommon after a recent surge in violence.
This year, the village has seen several shooting attacks in which Israeli settlers and soldiers have been targeted - including the killing of two brothers in February.  
That triggered a deadly rampage by a large crowd of settlers in one of the worst such acts in years. There have also been other instances of settler violence.

Ukraine war: Russia says drone injures five at Kursk railway station,"This video can not be played
Watch: A fire resulting from an alleged drone strike on a railway station in Kursk, Russia
Russia says that a Ukrainian drone has struck a railway station in the Kursk region, injuring five people.
Another drone is said to have landed in the Rostov region - which shares a border with Ukraine, like Kursk - but no injuries were reported.
Russia also said it stopped a drone that was heading for Moscow, which then crashed in an unpopulated area. 
Allegations of drone strikes inside Russia have become increasingly common in recent months. 
Although Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility for specific drone strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"".
Footage verified by the BBC shows smashed windows and a fire burning at the railway station in Kursk, which is about 150 km (93 miles) from the Ukrainian border.
Five people were injured by glass fragments, Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reported. The roof, exterior, and platform of the station were damaged. 
The Russian foreign ministry said it ""strongly condemns"" the drone attack in Kursk. 
""Ukrainian nationalists literally dealt a blow to our common history,"" ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement.
In its own statement, Russia's defence ministry said it had ""thwarted"" an ""attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack by drone on infrastructure in Moscow"" around 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT).
The Moscow-bound drone was destroyed by ""electronic warfare"" before losing control and crashing in an unpopulated area, the ministry added.
Russia's aviation agency Rosaviatsia said flights to the Domodedovo and Vnukovo international airports were ""temporarily limited"" as a result. 
It comes after seven people, including a six-year-old girl, were killed when a Russian missile struck a theatre in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Saturday.
Fifteen children were among 148 people wounded, officials said. 
President Zelensky vowed to ""respond to Russia for this terrorist attack - a tangible answer"".

Russia's Luna-25 spacecraft crashes into Moon,"Russia's unmanned Luna-25 spacecraft has crashed into the Moon after spinning out of control, officials say. 
It was Russia's first Moon mission in almost 50 years.
The craft was due to be the first ever to land on the Moon's south pole, but failed after encountering problems as it moved into its pre-landing orbit.
It was set to explore a part of the Moon which scientists think could hold frozen water and precious elements.
Roscosmos, Russia's state space corporation, said on Sunday morning that it had lost contact with the Luna-25 shortly after 14:57pm (11:57 GMT) on Saturday. 
Preliminary findings showed that the 800kg lander had ""ceased to exist as a result of a collision with the surface of the Moon"", it said in a statement.
It said a special commission would look into why the mission failed.
The loss of Luna-25 is a blow to Roscosmos. Russia's civilian space programme has been in decline for several years, as state funding is increasingly directed towards the military.
Russia was racing to the Moon's south pole against India, whose Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft is scheduled to land there in the coming days and send a rover to explore the rocks and craters, gathering data and images to send back to Earth.
Parts of the Moon's south pole remain permanently in shadow, which makes finding water a possibility.
A spokesperson for the Indian space agency Isro described the Luna-25 crash as ""unfortunate"".
""Every space mission is very risky and highly technical. It's unfortunate that Luna-25 has crashed,"" they told the BBC.
Roscosmos had acknowledged that the Luna-25 mission was risky and could fail. The craft launched from Vostochny Cosmodrome in the far eastern Amur region of Russia on 11 August, and then successfully entered the moon's orbit on Wednesday of this week.
It was expected to make history by making a soft landing on Monday or Tuesday, just days before the Indian touchdown.
No country has ever landed on the Moon's south pole before, although the US, Soviet Union and China have landed softly on the Moon's surface. 
Luna-25 was Russia's first Moon mission since 1976, when it was part of the Soviet Union. That mission, Luna-24, landed successfully.

Hurricane Hilary weakens but could still be deadly - US,"Hurricane Hilary has weakened as it heads towards Mexico's Pacific coast and California but could still cause ""life-threatening"" flooding, US meteorologists warn.
With winds of 85 mph (140 km/h), it has been downgraded to a Category 1 storm.
Heavy rain lashed parts of Mexico's Baja California peninsula and the south-western US overnight.
One man died after being swept away while crossing a stream in Baja California, an official said.
The man had been travelling in a car with his three children and a woman. The others all survived, local media reported.
Hilary is expected to weaken further to a tropical storm before it reaches southern California. Even still, it would be the first tropical storm to hit the US state in more than 80 years.
In its latest update at 06:00 GMT on Sunday, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Hilary was roughly 90 miles (145km) south of Baja California's westernmost point of Punta Eugenia.
Its centre will ""move close to the west-central coast of the Baja California peninsula"" on Sunday morning and will then move across southern California on Sunday afternoon, the NHC said. 
""Hilary appears to be weakening quickly,"" John Cangialosi, a senior hurricane specialist at the NHC, told the Associated Press news agency on Saturday.
""The eye is filling and the cloud tops in the eyewall and rainbands have been warming during the past several hours,"" he added.
Hilary was earlier a powerful Category 4 storm with winds up to 130mph.
Rainfall could reach 10in (25cm) in some areas of southern California and southern Nevada, the NHC said it Sunday morning's update. ""Dangerous to catastrophic flooding is expected.""
In San Diego, the National Weather Service (NWS) earlier issued a warning for the ""high potential"" of flash flooding. Nearly 26 million people in the south-western US were under flood watch.
On Friday, US President Joe Biden said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had ""pre-positioned personnel and supplies in the region"".
""I urge everyone in the path of the storm to take precautions and listen to the guidance from state and local officials,"" he said.
Parts of Mexico are under a tropical storm watch and its government has placed 18,000 soldiers on standby to assist in rescue efforts.
As the storm approached, Major League Baseball rescheduled three games in southern California, while SpaceX delayed the launch of a rocket from its base on the central California coast until at least Monday.
The National Park Service also closed Joshua Tree National Park and Mojave National Preserve, both in California, to prevent visitors from being stranded in the event of flooding.
Local officials in cities across the region, including in Arizona, have offered sandbags to residents seeking to safeguard their properties against potential floodwaters.
Hurricanes and tropical storms are reasonably common in Mexico. But the last time a tropical storm made landfall in southern California was in Long Beach in 1939. 
Experts say the abnormal weather events plaguing the US - and several areas across the globe - are being influenced by human-caused climate change.
In the wake July 2023 - the hottest month on record according to Nasa - the deadliest wildfire in modern US history spread across Hawaii on 8 August, killing at least 111 people. 
The damage was escalated by hurricane winds passing through the area.

Bristol's Dr Meaker heads Maasai water well fundraiser album,"A drum and bass producer has teamed up with musicians to raise money for a well in a Tanzanian Maasai village.
Bristol artist Dr Meaker has made a track called One Drop, which will lead the release of the fundraising album, Junglist Breaks vs Human Mistakes.
The project, managed by artist Marque Gilmore, aims to raise £5,870 for water supply in the Maasai village of Msaje.
Dr Meaker said he is really excited the project has brought artists together for an ""important cause"". 
""I wanted to do something good and do something to help others. I normally do one charity project a year and chose to take part in this,"" he said.
""It inspired me to be creative. For the track 'One Drop', I worked with Bristol singer Celestine and artist Guy and created a whole song sampling the sound of a drop of water.
""I hope we raise enough money to help the community in Tanzania get access to the water they need.""
The Water Changes Everything fundraiser that the proceeds will go towards was started by musician Giulia Lolli.
Ms Loli said the money will help the community buy ""desperately needed"" machinery to pump the water from a well.
""Creating this fund was a by-product of the boots on the ground privilege of living with the Maasai, deep in remote North East Tanzania.""
She has been in Msaje teaching art and music to orphans and reading writing to adults since 2022.
Mr Gilmore said he is humbled to be able to help Ms Luli and the Maasai community, and hopes this will be the first of many charitable album projects to come.
""There's no reason why drum and bass heads and junglists can't periodically apply what they do to a specific cause to create the awareness in their fanbase, who won't necessarily be talking about concepts such as climate change or water scarcity at a rave,"" he said.
""This album feels purposeful. My friend Guilia is living with the tribe doing amazing awareness-raising. It feels imperative to do something to help. 
""We need more projects like this. I think it makes people listen.""
The compilation album will be released near the end of October, and all of the money raised will go towards the Maasai water fundraiser.

Paintings of refugees given to 'show hosts' generosity',"A Ukrainian artist who paints family portraits for refugees to give to UK hosts is ""immortalising"" Britons' generosity, she says. 
Olha Son, who went to Cornwall when she arrived in the UK, was asked for paintings to thank people's hosts. 
The 35-year-old's art shows Britons sheltering Ukrainian refugees with a Union flag-decorated umbrella. 
She also said she felt she was ""doing something important"", partly showing the impact of the war in Ukraine.
Ms Son said she started painting five years ago when she was diagnosed with depression and initially painted still-life images, before receiving a message from a fellow Ukrainian refugee asking for a gift for their host family. 
She brainstormed ideas for the painting, which was ""easy"" because she ""was in an identical situation as my customer and I knew what it feels like to feel what they feel"". 
Since then, she has had commissions from other refugees who wanted to thank their hosts.
She said: ""It's like immortalising this phenomena of a British family who made a decision to open their doors to strangers from a different country, a different culture, in order to help in such a devastating situation as the war.""
One couple who received a painting from the Ukrainian family living with them for some months was Kevin Kennedy Ryan, 33, and Jessica Ryan Smith 32, from Sheffield. 
The couple gave them a painting showing their two families, painted by Ms Son, which Mr Kennedy Ryan said left them ""speechless"" and ""drove home some of the reality of the situation"". 
The British couple offered their home to refugees before Russia invaded Ukraine and said: ""It's not necessarily about refugees from Ukraine or any one particular area. 
""We all have this humanity that we share together.""

"Chernihiv: Russian missile strike kills seven and injures 144, Ukraine says","This video can not be played
Watch: At the scene of missile strike on Ukrainian theatre
Seven people, including a six-year-old girl, were killed when a Russian missile struck a theatre in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Saturday morning, officials have said.
Fifteen children were among 144 people wounded, the police said. At least 25 people were in hospital.
Among the victims were people who had been celebrating an Orthodox Christian holiday at church.
A main square and a university building were also damaged in the attack.
The UN called it ""heinous"", while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed a firm response by Ukrainian soldiers to a ""terrorist attack"". 
Chernihiv is located about 50km (31 miles) south of Ukraine's border with Belarus. It was besieged by Russian troops in the first few months of President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion launched in February 2022.
The city's imposing theatre was hit directly. Tiles were blown off the roofs of neighbouring buildings with one catching fire 100 metres away.
The theatre was hosting a gathering of drone manufacturers, the acting mayor of Chernihiv told the BBC.
""I understand that their aim was a military event taking place in the building of the drama theatre and that it was their target,"" Oleksandr Lomako said. 
""But it is clear that the Russians launching those missiles and those giving them orders in the middle of the day to the civilian city realised that the victims will be primarily civilians.
""There is no other way to interpret it than a war crime against civilians, yet another Russian war crime,"" he added.
Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later said all those inside the theatre had managed to reach shelter in time. 
He said that ""most of the victims were in their vehicles or crossing the road at the time of the rocket strike, as well as returning from a church"".
The city centre of Chernihiv is a popular area for people to stroll around, especially on the weekend, locals told the BBC.
Anna Zahreba, the manager of a Crimean Tatar restaurant just across the street from the theatre, said her staff were getting ready for a busy day when the missile hit. 
""I ran outside to see what was going on,"" she said. ""There were two 12-year-old girls here and a lot of blood. One had her leg badly wounded. Another girl was screaming.
""We applied a tourniquet and waited for an ambulance. It was taking a long time to get here, but some man stopped his car and we took a girl to a hospital."" 
Anna says staff rushed to help injured people with medical kit and blankets. 
""There are always many people walking around here, with children and baby strollers. Many restaurants and cafes in the area,"" she tells us. 
""We did not expect a day like this."" 
In his video address late on Saturday, President Zelensky said the child killed in the Russian strike was a girl named Sofia. 
Earlier, he said that Russia had turned an ""ordinary Saturday"" into ""a day of pain and loss"".

The UN said it was ""extremely disturbed"" by the attack.
""It is heinous to attack the main square of a large city, in the morning, while people are out walking, some going to the church to celebrate a religious day for many Ukrainians,"" Denise Brown, the current head of the UN in Ukraine, said in a statement.
""Attacks directed against civilians or civilian objects are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law,"" she said. ""It must stop.""
Three days of mourning have been announced in the city. 
Moscow is yet to comment.
Elsewhere, Russia has claimed that a Ukrainian drone hit a military airfield in the northwest Novgorod region, causing a fire that was quickly put out.
One plane was damaged but no casualties have been reported, it added. 
Ukraine has not commented on the alleged drone attack. 
Meanwhile, Kyiv's air force said the Ukrainian military had shot down 15 out of 17 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Moscow in an overnight strike.

Sudan conflict: Black market AK-47s flood Sudan's capital,"The price of an AK-47 assault rifle, one of the most-recognisable weapons of war, has fallen over the last few months by 50% on the black market in Sudan's capital, Khartoum - now costing only around $830 (£650).
A long-time arms dealer attributed the sharp drop in price to the fact that the black market has become saturated with the Russian-invented Kalashnikov - colloquially known as ""the Clash"" - after Sudan plunged into a civil war in April.
Battles between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) rage daily on the streets of Khartoum and the two other cities - Bahri and Omdurman - that make up the greater capital.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the man - who buys and sells weapons as a full-time business of sorts - said that although some of his suppliers are retired army officers, most are from the ranks of the RSF.
Supply outstripped demand, especially after what locals refer to as the Battle of Bahri, fought in mid-July, around three months into the conflict that has devastated Sudan.
Corpses of soldiers lay strewn on the streets of Bahri, with government forces having suffered heavy losses at the hands of the paramilitaries, who are in control of much of the city - as well as Khartoum and Omdurman. 
""Many soldiers got captured and many more were killed, so our suppliers have plenty of arms,"" said the dealer.
This means that he no longer has to rely on ""the Clash"" being smuggled in via the Sahara Desert from Libya, which he describes as an ""open arms market"" - a sign of the extent to which lawlessness and instability has engulfed the North African state since the overthrow and killing of long-serving ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
In the past the smuggled weapons used to be sold mainly to rebels and militiamen involved in long-running conflicts in Sudan, or neighbouring states like Chad.
But now fighters pick up the weapons of killed or captured enemies from the battlefields of greater Khartoum, and sell them via intermediaries to dealers who, in turn, have found a new group of buyers - some residents of the capital worried about the war, lawlessness and dangers on their doorsteps.
Having learned of dealers though word of mouth, residents call them up to place an order. The dealers deliver the AK-47 rifle to their homes, and give them a quick demonstration of how to use a weapon they had never imagined they would own.  
Ammunition is sold separately - by dealers hanging around Omdurman's main market called Souq Omdurman.
A 55-year-old father of six said he bought an AK-47 rifle because of rising crime, and ""potential attacks from other people in Khartoum"".
""They might just attack you, for whatever reason. It might turn into an ethnic war. You never know. That is our main fear,"" he added.
Sudan descended into a civil war in mid-April after a fall out between the army chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as Hemedti. 
The two staged a coup in October 2021, but then got involved in a power struggle that saw their men take up arms against each other in a war that shows no sign of ending.
The arms dealer said that in far greater demand than AK-47 rifles are pistols, which are easier to use and to carry. 
Residents are snapping them up because the collapse of government - including the police force, prison service and judiciary - has led to crime getting out of control.
Hardened criminals are now on the streets, following a mass break-out from Khartoum's biggest prison early in the war. 
Crime has also soared because the conflict has forced many businesses to shut, having a knock-on effect on unemployment, while the cost of living has risen because of the scarcity of basic food items.
Though people are struggling financially, a significant number of residents are buying weapons as  safety is of paramount importance - especially as homes are being looted and women are being raped. 
The arms dealer said he has dropped the price of pistols four-fold, from 800,000 Sudanese pounds ($1,330) to 200,000 Sudanese pounds. 
""What used to make them [pistols] expensive was the licence. Now you don't need to get one. You just buy it and use it,"" the dealer said, adding that he made a good profit because sales were higher than ever before.
While owners of AK-47 rifles keep the weapon at home, pistol-owners carry it with them when they go out - whether it is to the fuel station or market.
The threat posed by criminals is highlighted by the plight of a 24-year-old man who got married just a few years ago, and has a one-year-old child.
As he walked to a market in Omdurman, he was confronted by a gang, which robbed him of his cash and shot him in the spine. With the only functioning hospital in the city unable to treat him, he was taken on a dangerous road journey to a hospital in River Nile State, about 200km (124 miles) away.
The bullet was removed, but the shooting left him paralysed - a painful reminder of a war that has ruined the lives of millions of people.

"Miyu Pranoto: Dance prodigy, 9, blazes trail for girls","Whenever nine-year-old Miyu Ananthamaya Pranoto stomps her white sneakers on the dance floor, crowds jostle for the best view of her freestyle and breakdance moves.
The diminutive dance prodigy from East Jakarta has gained a massive following for her effortless mastery of moves that are bread and butter for dancers twice or even thrice her age - and height.
Sporting baggy clothes and with her hair tied in a tight bun, Miyu is charting a rare path for girls in conservative Indonesia, where the dance scene is well behind other Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan.
And her parents are fully supportive. ""Miyu's dream is our dream. Whatever her goal is, it is also our goal in life,"" says her mother Rizky Mellissa.
At a recent international contest in Vietnam, one of Miyu's performances went viral on YouTube with 45 million views.
After that breakout appearance at the Summer Jam Dance Camp in Da Nang, her Instagram followers doubled overnight to 217,000.
Semmy Blank, Miyu's dance mentor, said her talent and passion makes it easy for Miyu to learn difficult moves by heart. ""It's not hard for me to teach a person like Miyu. Compared to adults, I think she really can top them as a freestyler and her skills improve really fast in terms of foundation, technique and musicality."" 
At a recent dance class in East Jakarta, Miyu took centre stage.
With Kid Ink's You Remind Me and Duckwrth's Power Power blaring from Bluetooth speakers, Miyu stomped and glided across the dance floor. Even when other dancers were out of breath, she kept going, repeating each step over and over until she got it right.
Always eager to learn, Miyu asked a classmate for pointers on a difficult breakdance move - spinning on the floor before hopping back up on her legs.
The class ended with Miyu's classmates swarming her for selfies. She politely obliged.
Miyu says that it was Korean boy band BTS - her favourite BTS member is Jimin and her favourite choreography from the group is for their hit song Idol - that got her into pop music, and then into dance. 
K-pop also introduced her to dance competitions like Street Woman Fighter and dance channels like 1Million. ""It surprised me, I didn't think there were kids who could dance so well,"" says Miyu, who started dancing just two years ago.
Freestyle is her favoured genre - she won an award in that category during her first competition: ""It's more free than choreography too so it's not so much thinking exactly, it's just like freedom.""
Miyu's father Haris Pranoto said dance classes keep his daughter in top form as she competes across Indonesia almost every month, from Jakarta to Bali to South Sumatra. ""Miyu has trained more for dance battles actually. So mentally, she has the courage for a dance battle.""
When she is not dancing, Miyu divides her time between school and taking piano and voice lessons. She has also taken up drawing as a hobby.
""After school, straight to piano lessons,"" says Ms Mellissa. ""Tomorrow, she has singing lessons and then dance practice with her crew. Our job as parents is to find a balance so she doesn't get burnt out.""
Miyu says she wants to take her passion for dance to the next level: ""I want to be a professional dancer and maybe a teacher, not just for students, but for dance idols"".

"Drew Findling: Trump's new lawyer once called him 'racist, cruel'","Ex-clients describe him as ""the biggest lawyer in the game"" and a ""Robin Hood with Jesus swag"". Now he's defending the most high-profile client of all.
Drew Findling was hired last year to represent Donald Trump in the criminal investigation into election interference in the state of Georgia in the 2020 election.
The veteran lawyer has previously criticised Mr Trump and donated to Fani Willis, the woman now prosecuting him.
He's also a revered figure in Atlanta, or as he calls it ""Hip Hop Hollywood"".
A self-identified liberal, the 64-year-old has attacked the former president on several occasions.
In 2017, he tweeted that President Trump's firing of the federal prosecutor in Manhattan was ""a sign of FEAR that [the prosecutor] would aggressively investigate the stench hovering"" over him. 
Two months later, he again took issue with the then-president over his stance on the Central Park Five, a group of teenagers wrongfully convicted in the rape of a white jogger in New York's Central Park in 1989.
Mr Trump had forcefully advocated for the death penalty and did not retract his comments after the verdicts were overturned, which Mr Findling said was ""racist, cruel, sick, unforgivable, and un-American"".
And in 2018, Mr Findling inserted himself into a feud between Mr Trump and basketball star LeBron James, using a social media post to call the former president ""pathetic"" and ""the racist architect of fraudulent Trump University"".
Asked why he is now defending the ex-president, Mr Findling likened his decision to John Adams - the second US president who, in his earlier career as a lawyer, had defied anti-British sentiments and defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the Boston Massacre of 1770.
""I do not believe that we choose our client or clients based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, political belief or the substantive issues involved in the crime,"" he told the New York Times last year.
""We have our personal lives and we have our personal politics, and I don't apologise for my personal politics.""
In addition to his anti-Trump past, Mr Findling also donated $1,440 (£1,130) in July 2020 to Democrat Fani Willis's successful bid for the top prosecutor post in Georgia's most populous county.
As Fulton County district attorney, Ms Willis on Monday indicted Mr Trump and 18 associates over their alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state, narrowly won by Joe Biden on his way to the White House.
The former president's legal team has indicated it will lean heavily on a free speech defence to contest the charges in this case and a separate election subversion case brought by the federal government.
""When it comes to political speech, you can not only advocate for a position, but you can take action, you can petition, you can ask even your vice-president to pause the vote,"" attorney John Lauro, who is leading the defence in the government's case, told CNN earlier this month.
""Asking is aspirational. Asking is not action. It's core free speech.""
Such a defence may give insight into the hiring of an Atlanta-based trial lawyer with more than three decades of experience.
Beginning his career as a public defender, a taxpayer-paid attorney assigned to low-income clients, Mr Findling and the law firm he founded in 1987 have represented an entire rolodex of high-profile figures.
They include athletes Shaquille O'Neal and Dennis Rodman, comedians Katt Williams and Mike Epps, and stars of the reality show Love & Hip Hop.
But most prominently, he is the go-to lawyer for Atlanta rappers. ""If there's a hip hop artist in trouble, I'll get a phone call,"" he told MIC in a 2018 interview.
When he first defended a rapper, Mr Findling confessed to the Times, he'd ""never listened to a rap song"".
The case saw his client - Demetrius Flenory, known in rap circles as Big Meech - acquitted of murder in 2003.
Mr Findling has spoken of how that outcome, and other clients since, have opened his eyes to how the racial backgrounds and biographies of some can make them more vulnerable to criminal prosecution.
His name was trumpeted through the streets after he helped negotiate a plea deal on gun charges for hitmaker Gucci Mane, as well as an early release from prison that led to the rapper's career resurgence.
Mr Findling has gone on to counsel several more big names in the mecca of black entertainment, including Cardi B, Waka Flocka Flame and all three members of the rap trio Migos.
In 2017, the late Memphis rapper Young Dolph christened him ""the Billion Dollar Lawyer"" - a nickname he still touts on his Instagram bio.
Mr Findling's rap-heavy clientele has also made him keenly aware of how free speech in the hip hop world is interpreted - often wrongly - as evidence of criminal conduct or intent.
""Somebody listens to a rap song that lasts for four minutes and 11 seconds, and pulls one verse out, and tries to conjure up some type of criminal case out of it,"" he told the Times.
Before Ms Willis indicted Mr Trump, her last major probe resulted in charges against Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug and 27 associates at his YSL music label last year.
Each set of defendants in both cases is being prosecuted under the state's racketeering laws, as co-conspirators in a criminal racket.  
In addition to defending Mr Trump, Mr Findling also currently represents a YSL defendant - YFN Lucci, real name Rashawn Bennett.
In June, he rejected a plea deal offered to Mr Bennett, accused prosecutors of intentionally delaying the trial and said his team stands ""ready and prepared to defend these false allegations"".
But the powerhouse lawyer has his work cut out for him with Mr Trump, a notoriously difficult client who often ignores legal advice and will likely seek to postpone the case as long as he can amid his third presidential campaign and other court dates.
And, instead of arguing over the intent of lyrics to a rap song, Mr Findling will have to argue that the actions taken by an American president were simply aspirational.

Jews in the German Army: Different generations reflect on changing attitudes,"""Captain, I would rather you didn't speak to me like that.""
Choosing to stand up to your commanding officer as a new recruit is never a decision to be taken lightly. Even more so when you're the only Jewish member of the German Army, working alongside soldiers who fought under the Nazis in World War II.
Although decades have passed since Michael Fürst was on the receiving end of antisemitic comments, the sting is fresh in his memory, he tells BBC World Service's Heart and Soul programme. 
""I had never heard anything like this before, never!"" he exclaims.  
Now 76, Michael is a lawyer and president of the Association of Jewish Communities of Lower Saxony. His office is lined with books that reflect these twin pillars of his life, along with medals and photographs.  
Michael signed up to the German armed forces - the Bundeswehr - in 1966. He believes he was the first Jew to do so after World War Two. At the time, anyone in West Germany whose family had been persecuted by the Nazis was exempt from military service. 
Two of Michael's grandparents perished in the concentration camps, but Michael was brought up with a sense of pride in his identity as both a German and a Jew. Joining the military was something that all his friends were doing on leaving school - and Michael saw no reason why he should not do the same.
""I was 19 years old, I was very sporty, and I didn't know what to do with my life,"" he remembers. ""So there was only one decision: I would join the army like all the others.""
Other Jews outside Michael's immediate circle found his choice hard to accept. ""They called me the schmuck from Hanover,"" he laughs. ""A stupid boy. And friends in the USA for example said: 'How can you go the army? How can you live in Germany?' 
""It was a big thing to decide, whether you were more German or more Jewish. So I decided to be German and Jew.""
During his two years in the Bundeswehr, Michael says he did not experience any antisemitism, apart from the remarks made on that sole occasion by his commanding officer. Clearly unsettled by the comments, Michael arranged a meeting with his captain the following day and asked to be moved to a different group.
""I'm glad you've come to see me, Fürst,"" said the captain. ""I wanted to speak to you. I am an antisemite. My parents were sent during the Nazi time to the east of Germany, to make their new life there. And all the problems we had in that period came from the worldwide Jews."" 
Michael recalls, with a wry smile, his captain's attempt to win him over: ""But I have no problem with you, Fürst. We can be good friends.""
""Anyone who spoke like that today would be thrown out of the military immediately,"" says Michael. ""But he returned to his old battalion. I reported it to the chief sergeant, who asked him: 'Is this true?' The captain nodded, the sergeant's eyes widened and his face turned pale. The next day I changed group.""
Michael remembers serving alongside soldiers who still displayed their wartime medals with pride, including those with the infamous hooked cross. Today the use of such symbols is banned in anything other than very limited contexts, and punishable with a jail term. 
""These soldiers would say that they struggled for Germany, they got this medal and they would never agree to put it away,"" he says. ""I had no problem with them, and they had no problem with me as a Jew. But we had no discussion about Jews. It was not the time to discuss anti-Semitism. That came later, much later.""
Michael Fürst and a number of Jews of a similar age have blazed a trail for others to join the Bundeswehr. 
This new generation has also found themselves having to defend their career choice in the military.
Anne, 36, converted to Judaism as a teenager, and attended a Jewish high school in Germany which had strong links to Israel. We are not publishing her surname because of rules about identifying serving soldiers.
Her decision to become a soldier at the age of 15 was met with incredulity by her classmates and teachers.
""Why do you want to go to those who killed six million of us?"" they asked her. The school principal suggested she work for the Red Cross. ""I told her I don't want to go to a deployment and stand there without a weapon to defend myself and defend others,"" she says. ""It didn't feel like that was my path.""
So determined was Anne to join the German military that she researched the founding principles of the Bundeswehr to be in a better position to counter any challenge. ""The Bundeswehr is an armed force that exists to defend values that we share as a society - protecting human rights, protecting the constitution, based on a free and democratic order,"" she says.
""When you understand how those values were violated by the Nazis, you can see that their armed forces were built on a completely different foundation. I was so thankful to live in a society based on the principles of the modern German constitution, and I wanted to protect that.""
Johannes, a 24 year-old technician in the German air force, goes further. ""There's a lot of cross-over between Jewish teachings and the values of the Bundeswehr,"" he argues. 
""For example, in Jewish ethics, everyone has the right to self-defence. Defending our values, defending the German constitution, that is self-defence. So for me, being Jewish is very compatible with being a soldier.""  
It is perhaps a reflection of how younger Germans feel about the country's military past that Johannes did not even consider that joining the armed forces could be seen as an unusual choice for a Jew. 
Today it is estimated there are around 300 Jewish serving personnel, many of whose families came to Germany following the break-up of the Soviet Union. 
And as of two years ago, Jewish serving personnel have had the same access to religious pastoral care as Christian soldiers.
It follows a historic agreement in 2019 between Germany's Central Council of Jews and the Ministry of Defence. Within the Bundeswehr there is now a Jewish chaplaincy with military rabbis who advocate for Jewish serving personnel and take care of their religious and spiritual needs. 
The German military had Jewish chaplains in the past, but the tradition died out after World War I and was not revived. Today's military rabbis also offer voluntary classes to other members of the Bundeswehr to learn about Judaism.  
Zsolt Balla, a Hungarian-born Jew, was installed in 2021 as the spiritual lead of the chaplaincy. He believes that the timing of his appointment and the creation of the military rabbinate reflects a shift in German attitudes towards Jews - a symbol, perhaps, of Germany's reckoning with its abhorrent past.
""I was born in Hungary in 1979, and I still remember what it meant to grow up in a Communist country in the 1980s,"" he explains. 
""I won't say that history was overwritten exactly, but I saw how people never really managed to confront the wrongdoings and the terrible tendencies of WW2 and the Shoah [the Holocaust] in the way that Germany has.  
""Maybe, just maybe, the reason why the agreement was made between the Jewish communities and the German Ministry of Defence is that we now reach the historical distance that enables us not to be paralysed by the past.""
The ghosts of the past can still be sensed in many places however, and the spectre of antisemitism has not been banished from the German military altogether. Nazi memorabilia has been found in barracks in the past six years, and in 2020 online private networks were discovered sharing antisemitic language among soldiers.
""I'm asked very often about antisemitism,"" says Zsolt Balla, with a weary smile, ""and my answer is that what we have to understand is that in any single armed force - not just in Germany - where people come voluntarily in, it drives people from the right side of the political spectrum. By definition. 
""But for me, as long as the system says: we have a problem and we have to do something about it, I'm on board,"" he says.
""My job is about building bridges. Creating a Jewish chaplaincy is a really positive development. As Jews in the military, now we have an address. Now we know who to turn to if we have questions regarding Judaism. Many people in the Bundeswehr had never met a Jew in Germany, but now they can say they have. That's wonderful."" 
Michael Fürst is sceptical that the Bundeswehr needs quite so many military rabbis, given the relatively small number of Jewish soldiers - the aim is eventually to recruit 10 Jewish chaplains. But he acknowledges that the creation of the chaplaincy is a step in the right direction. 
""Sure it's progress, and not only for Jews - for other religions too,"" he says. 
""After I left the army, I worked hard to build a strong connection between Jews and the Bundeswehr. I was only a lieutenant, but I think I was the general of the Jews.""

Vietnam War: The pastor who survived 17 years in forgotten jungle army,"Pastor Y Hin Nie, 75, preaches the gospel from the comfort of his church in the US state of North Carolina. But as a young man he survived nearly two decades in the jungle, giving sermons to his comrades fighting Vietnamese troops long after the war had ended - his AK-47 never far from his side.
On the run and cut off from the world, Hin Nie and his unit of insurgents foraged for food and hunted for tiger skins to pay the Khmer Rouge. His ""forgotten army"" did not give up arms until 1992, after Hin Nie negotiated their freedom.
The first time Y Hin Nie nearly died was on the night of 30 January 1968, when the Vietcong, fighting for the Communist North in Vietnam, launched a massive attack, firing barrages of rockets on US-held areas under the cover of Tet - or New Year - celebrations. 
Hin Nie, who grew up in Vietnam, was living with American Christian missionaries in Buon Ma Thuot, the largest city in Vietnam's Central Highlands. His own mother and father had left him with the missionaries when he was eight because they were poor and wanted him to have a better life, he says. 
His adopted ""godmother"", Carolyn Griswold, was sleeping when the rockets hit. Separate reports from missionaries say Communist troops also detonated explosives inside the home.
Carolyn's father, Leon, died immediately. Hin Nie - who happened to be staying at a friend's that night - rushed home and helped to dig Carolyn out of the rubble. She died soon after.
""My godmother died with suffering,"" he says. ""God saved my life.""
Many other missionaries were killed and captured while Hin Nie hid in a bunker.
Despite his losses he picked himself up and carried on, throwing himself into Bible school and working at a church. 
He did not join the war until a decisive battle in March 1975, when the US-backed South's troops were destroyed and forced to retreat from Buon Ma Thuot.
As bombs rained down, Hin Nie and 32 bible school students escaped, walking for miles.
This was when Hin Nie was approached by fighters of the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (Fulro), an armed insurgent movement that advocated autonomy for ethnic minorities called Montagnards. These highland people have long faced persecution in Vietnam for reasons including their Christian faith. 
They hoped Hin Nie's close links with American missionaries and his spoken English could help reconnect them with US troops, who had recruited tens of thousands of highlanders as frontline fighters before withdrawing from the war in 1973.
Hin Nie said he felt drawn to join the fighters, who were devout Christians like him. ""I had no choice, it touched my heart.""
On 10 March 1975, he fled into the jungle with them.  
For the first four years, they stayed within Vietnam, constantly on the run, hiding from the army. 
""Shoot and run, shoot and run. We didn't have strong weapons,"" Hin Nie says, adding that he wasn't involved in direct combat himself, but carried an AK-47 for self-defence and hunting.
By 1979, Vietnamese troops were expanding their operations searching for Fulro, so the group fled into Cambodia, to Vietnam's west.
""We couldn't stay, so we crossed the border - it was too dangerous,"" he says.
But leaving Vietnam brought new perils. Guerrillas of Pol Pot's genocidal Khmer Rouge controlled pockets on Cambodia's eastern border.
Remnants of the regime - responsible for an estimated 1.7 million deaths during four years of terror in Cambodia - had fled there after being overthrown by Vietnam-backed forces.
Fulro needed permission from the Khmer Rouge to stay so Hin Nie met their local commanders in the jungles of Mondulkiri province.
""I said, 'We have the same enemy' - it was the only thing we agreed on. If the communists come from Vietnam to this side, then we could tell them,"" he says. 
The Khmer Rouge allowed Hin Nie and his battalion to stay. But they demanded monthly ""taxes"" by way of large amounts of tiger and python skin, and deer horn.
Hin Nie says his unit caught tigers in traps. While the fear of tigers was real - tigers killed three people in the camp - the fear of the Khmer Rouge was even greater.
""They were very angry, they counted everything,"" he recalls. ""Many times they threatened us: 'If you don't pay tax you have to go back.'""
Fulro would still carry out patrols and there were occasional skirmishes with Vietnamese forces as the unit moved from one jungle clearing to another, never settling for longer than a month.
Hin Nie remembers a ""wild life"" - the Fulro fighters roamed like animals, eating whatever they could find, including leaves from trees, he says.
""We walked and walked and walked… we'd shoot elephants, anything we could see.""
Around this time he married his wife H Biuh, who was part of the group. They had three children in the jungle, but one died.
Religion was a constant in the camp.
The first thing Hin Nie would do when they arrived at a new spot was erect a cross. He would then hold sermons for the soldiers, women and children.
Christmas was never missed. One celebration stands out for him.
In 1982, they were singing carols one night, which some local Khmer Rouge heard from a distance. A handful of them walked over.
""A general asked if they could join us because the songs were very beautiful, and they stayed with us in the camp,"" Hin Nie recalls. ""We sang and I preached in two languages - Khmer and Bunong.""
Vietnamese communists also heard the singing and approached, he says, but Fulro and the Khmer Rouge chased them away.
Along with being the Fulro pastor, Hin Nie was also its chief liaison officer. This meant dealing with local Khmer Rouge, but also tuning in to shortwave radio each morning, including the BBC, Voice of America and Vietnamese radio, to try to follow what was happening in a world that had forgotten them - and which, with the Cold War over, had changed beyond recognition.
By 1991, Cambodian forces under then-Prime Minister Hun Sen - who only handed over the reins to his son earlier this month after 38 years in power - had become a new threat for Hin Nie to negotiate. 
But apart from a few local Khmer Rouge and Cambodian soldiers, hardly anyone was aware the Fulro fighters were still in the jungle. Their former comrades had no idea if they were still alive, far less where they were - and neither did the international community.
So it was a great surprise when, in 1992, Hin Nie started negotiations with UN officials. They had arrived in the wake of the genocide to administer the Cambodian national election as part of a peacekeeping mission.
Hin Nie says he met a local UN official and wrote on a piece of paper in French: ""We are Fulro - waiting for freedom and waiting for your help.""
Two months later, a group of UN officials came to meet Hin Nie. ""They kept interrogating me for one week to make sure why I lived in the jungle,"" he says. They wanted to know if he was Khmer Rouge. He told them he wasn't.
Another UN meeting followed, where Hin Nie requested more weapons ""to fight the communists"" but was told that was not possible.
""You only have 400 [fighters] - there are millions of soldiers in Vietnam. We don't want you to die,"" was the response, he says.
Then in August 1992, American journalist Nate Thayer visited the camp and the story of the last Fulro fighters became known to the outside world.
Thayer reported in the Phnom Penh Post that the group were still waiting for instructions from their leader who, unknown to them, had been executed by the Khmer Rouge 17 years earlier.
""Please, can you help us find our president, Y Bham Enuol?"" Fulro Commander-in-Chief Y Peng Ayun asked. ""We have been waiting for contact and orders from our president since 1975. Do you know where he is?""
Some of the group wept when they were told he had died. News of the Fulro president's death had never reached Hin Nie on his shortwave radio set. 
He and his comrades had heard the war was over but there was still an unrealistic hope the US might get back in contact and provide support. Although they were trapped on the border, the Fulro fighters were loath to give up the struggle for their homeland and become refugees.
Hin Nie was asked how he felt towards the US. ""I am not angry, but very sad that the Americans forgot us. The Americans are like our elder brother, so it is very sad when your brother forgets you,"" he told Thayer.
Upon learning that their leader was gone, the Fulro fighters agreed to put down their weapons and sought asylum in the US.
The group bypassed normal refugee channels and were on planes within months. Thayer, who Fulro veterans credited with telling their story to the world, joined them every step of the way (he died in January - Hin Nie presided over the memorial and veterans attended).
Landing in the US back in November 1992, Hin Nie was greeted by a banner welcoming the ""forgotten army"". He and H Biuh moved to Greensboro with their surviving children, who remain in the US.
Soon Hin Nie started speaking out against the persecution of his people, testifying to the US Congress. Because of his preaching, he remains a target in Vietnamese state media to this day.  
The Vietnamese government claims Fulro still exists, and accuses exiled former members like Hin Nie of trying to wage insurrection in Vietnam. In 2021, the VOV news agency said he was behind a ""reactionary organisation disguised as a religious sect based in the Central Highlands, which aimed to incite local people to sabotage the united Vietnamese state"".
Hin Nie says this is nonsense.
Under Communist rule, the Montagnards still face widespread intimidation, arbitrary detention and ill-treatment in Vietnam.
Vietnam's government did not respond to a request for comment.
At Hin Nie's United Montagnard Christian Church in Greensboro there are hundreds in the congregation. He preaches to them in English, Vietnamese and Rade, and sometimes sings songs in other languages of the Central Highlands.
""They still put propaganda against me but Fulro has died. Everyone has died,"" he says. 
""The Vietnamese try to shut the mouths of people in Vietnam - but I am here.""

"Canada wildfires: British Columbia declares emergency as 15,000 homes told to evacuate","This video can not be played
WATCH: Canada wildfires: The past 48 hours in 75 seconds
About 15,000 households have been ordered to evacuate in Canada's British Columbia, as firefighters battle raging wildfires that have set homes ablaze.
Officials said a ""significant"" number of buildings caught fire in West Kelowna, a city of 36,000 people, and more than 2,400 homes were evacuated. 
A state of emergency has been declared for the entire province, where hundreds of separate fires are burning.
Hundreds of miles north, a huge fire edges towards the city of Yellowknife.
An official deadline to evacuate the city - the capital of Canada's Northwest Territories - lapsed on Friday. A local official said later that day that nearly all residents had left, either by car or plane.
About 19,000 of the city's 20,000 inhabitants had evacuated, the territories' environment and communities minister Shane Thompson told reporters. 
""Some are choosing to shelter in place. If you are still in Yellowknife and you are not essential to the emergency response, please evacuate,"" Mr Thompson said.
He warned that the highways and airport could be impacted by the wildfires. 
In British Columbia, evacuation orders grew from covering 4,000 homes on Friday afternoon to about 15,000 in the space of an hour. Another 20,000 homes are under alert. 
Premier of the province, David Eby, said that evening that the situation had ""evolved rapidly"" and officials were braced for ""an extremely challenging situation in the days ahead"".
""This year, we're facing the worst #BCWildfire season ever,"" Mr Eby wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""Given these fast-moving conditions, we are declaring a provincial state of emergency.""
The premier said this would ensure ""that we're in a position to rapidly access any tools we need to support communities"".
He said that more and more people were being evacuated, warning that ""emergency orders could include travel restrictions to specific areas if people do not respect our calls to avoid non-essential travel"".
Canada is having its worst wildfire season on record, with at least 1,000 fires burning across the country, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).
Experts say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.
Extreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground - which can provide fuel for fires that can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong.
Earlier, West Kelowna fire chief Jason Brolund described the wildfire as ""devastating"". 
""We fought hard last night to protect our community. We fought 100 years worth of fires all in one night,"" he added.
Local officials have already reported ""significant structural loss"" in the area, including in Trader's Cove, just north of West Kelowna. 
No deaths have been reported so far.
Juliana Loewen lives in Kelowna - a larger twin city of West Kelowna on the eastern shore of Okanagan Lake. She told the BBC how locals had watched a plume of smoke coming over the mountainside like an ""ominous cloud of destruction"" and how some on the Trader's Cove side jumped into the lake as the fire spread and exit routes were blocked.
Her brother and grandmother fled to her house after ""the fire jumped very quickly from one tree to an entire area, threatening an entire residential community"".
Local residents are used to the fires because of a ""California-style climate"" in the area - but the heat, dryness and wind seen in recent days had created the ""perfect conditions for a firestorm"", Ms Loewen added.
The airspace around Kelowna International Airport has now been closed to everything other than aerial firefighters.

New shooting mars election campaign in Ecuador,"A candidate in Sunday's presidential election in violence-hit Ecuador has called for an investigation after shooting erupted near a restaurant where he was having breakfast.
Otto Sonnenholzner, a conservative politician, was with his family and supporters when shots rang out.
He is not believed to have been the target. But the campaign has been marred by a surge in gang attacks.
Candidate Fernando Villavicencio was assassinated in the capital last week.
The incident involving Mr Sonnenholzner, 40, occurred on Saturday in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city.
A video posted on social media shows the former-vice president talking to supporters in the restaurant before shots are heard, sowing panic. Local journalists said there was robbery in the vicinity.
Afterwards, Mr Sonnenholzner tweeted: ""Thank God we are all fine but we demand an investigation into what happened... We can't go on like this.""
While no other presidential candidate has been directly targeted since Mr Villavicencio's murder in Quito, shootouts like this serve to demonstrate just how dangerous Ecuador has become. 
They are, sadly, part of everyday life, especially in cities like Guayaquil which has been overrun by drug-traffickers. 
Earlier this week, a similar thing happened during the campaign event of fellow candidate Daniel Noboa. And a local politician was shot dead in northern Esmeraldas province.
Candidates are eager to highlight these dangers ahead of the vote.
The shooting of Fernando Villavicencio upended campaigning, with candidates now very much focusing on peace and security - because that is what every Ecuadorean wants to be reassured about.
Bulletproof vests are also making more of an appearance on the campaign trail - and many candidates dialled down their closing campaign events, with many Ecuadoreans exercising a huge amount of caution ahead of the elections. 
There is real fear of more violence to come as people get ready to vote. 
Mr Villavicencio was an outspoken journalist who had uncovered corruption and denounced links between organised crime and officials. 
Six men have been arrested in connection with his assassination, all of them Colombian citizens. 
In another development on Saturday, the mayor of the coastal town of La Libertad said he had been the target of an assassination attempt. 
Mayor Francisco Tamariz said gunmen had fired 30 shots at his vehicle on Friday night, but he escaped unharmed.

Sara Sharif murder inquiry: Searches continue for father of 10-year-old,"Police in Pakistan say they are continuing to search for the father of a 10-year-old girl who was found dead in a house in Surrey.
Sara Sharif's body was found at her family home in Woking, in the early hours of 10 August.
Surrey Police have confirmed they want to speak to Urfan Sharif, along with his partner and brother.
BBC News has been told two police teams in Jhelum, north Punjab in Pakistan, are looking for Mr Sharif.
Mr Nasir Mehmood Bajwa, in Jhelum, told the BBC that after police find Mr Sharif they are likely to take him into custody after receiving the go-ahead from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in Islamabad.
Pakistan's foreign ministry and the FIA have not confirmed or shared any verbal or written orders on this case.  
Mr Sharif, his partner Beinash Batool and his brother Faisal Malik all left the UK for Pakistan on 9 August, a day before Sara's body was discovered.
Surrey Police have said Mr Sharif, 41, made a 999 call from Pakistan shortly after landing in Islamabad with his partner, his brother and five children, aged between one and 13.
The call led officers to the house in Woking where they found the body of Sara who had sustained ""multiple and extensive injuries"", likely to have been caused over a sustained period of time. 
BBC News spoke to a Woking travel agent who said he was contacted by Mr Sharif at about 22:00 BST on Tuesday 8 August, saying he wanted to book tickets to Pakistan as soon as possible.
He confirmed that eight one-way tickets - for Mr Sharif, his brother, his wife and five children - were used on a flight on 9 August that landed in Islamabad at about 05:30 local time, on Thursday 10 August.
When police discovered Sara's body at the house in Woking no-one else was there, detectives confirmed.
Det Supt Mark Chapman, from Surrey Police and Sussex Police Major Crime Team, said: ""While the post-mortem has not provided us with an established cause of death at this time, the fact that we now know that Sara had suffered multiple and extensive injuries over a sustained and extended period has significantly changed the nature of our investigation, and we have widened the timescale of the focus of our inquiry.""
Police are working with the Crown Prosecution Service, Interpol, the National Crime Agency and the Foreign Office to carry out their investigation and in liaising with Pakistani authorities.
There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Pakistan.

Britney Spears on Sam Asghari divorce: 'I couldn't take the pain anymore',"Britney Spears has spoken for the first time since her husband Sam Asghari announced their split, saying she ""couldn't take the pain anymore"".
Mr Asghari, 29, cited ""irreconcilable differences"" in a divorce petition filed in Los Angeles on Wednesday. 
He asks that spousal support and payment of legal fees be paid by Ms Spears, the documents state.
Ms Spears, 41, said she was ""a little shocked"" that her six-year relationship with Mr Asghari had come to an end. 
Discussing their breakup in an Instagram post, the singer wrote: ""I'm not here to explain why because it's honestly nobody's business.""
""I've been playing it strong for way too long and my Instagram may seem perfect but it's far from reality and I think we all know that,"" she added. 
""I would love to show my emotions and tears on how I really feel but for some reason I've always had to hide my weaknesses."" 
Ms Spears said she would be ""as strong as I can"" and she was ""actually doing pretty damn good"". 
Mr Asghari, an Iranian-American actor, model and fitness trainer, met Ms Spears while she was shooting the video for her song Slumber Party in 2016.
He was a vocal supporter of her efforts to end her father Jamie's conservatorship; a fight she won just months before their marriage.
The couple got engaged in September 2021 and were married in a small ceremony last June. 
Rumours of their marital struggles were reported in US tabloids this year. The two had recently been seen without their wedding rings in public.
In his own post on Instagram, Mr Asghari said: ""After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together.
""We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always.""
He added: ""Asking for privacy seems rediculous [sic] so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.""

Taiwan detects 42 warplanes in Chinese military drills,"More than 40 Chinese warplanes flew over Taiwan's air defence zone on Saturday, as part of military drills that Taiwan called ""irrational and provocative"".
About 26 Chinese aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's ministry of defence said. 
It said Beijing was trying to influence Taiwan's upcoming election.
China said the drills would test its forces' ability to fight in ""combat conditions"", state media reported.
The People's Liberation Army ""launched joint air and sea patrols and military exercises of the navy and air force around the island of Taiwan"" on Saturday, military spokesperson Shi Yi is quoted by Xinhua as saying.
The exercises would serve as a ""stern warning to the collusion of 'Taiwan independence' separatists with foreign elements and their provocations"", he added.
It follows Chinese anger at a recent stopover by Taiwan's vice president, William Lai, in the United States. China previously launched major military exercises after Nancy Pelosi, then US House speaker, visited Taiwan last year and again when President Tsai Ing-wen met with US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California.
Mr Lai, a frontrunner in Taiwan's upcoming presidential election in January, was visiting the US on a trip to Paraguay.
China said Mr Lai was a ""troublemaker"" and that it would take ""resolute measures"" to ""safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity"".
Despite China's claim to sovereignty over the island, Taiwan governs itself. It described China's military exercise as ""irrational and provocative behaviour"". 
Taiwan said it would dispatch ""appropriate forces"" to respond ""with practical actions"" - adding that the national army was using reconnaissance methods to ""strictly control"" the situation.
""Conducting a military exercise this time under a pretext not only does not help the peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, but also highlights (China's) militaristic mentality and confirms the hegemonic nature of its military expansion,"" Taiwan's defence ministry said.
Taiwan's foreign minister said China's military drills were intended to influence Taiwan's elections.
""The PRC has made it clear it wants to shape Taiwan's coming national election,"" Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on X, formerly known as Twitter. 
""Well, it's up to our citizens to decide, not the bully next door,"" he added. 
In Taiwan's capital Taipei, residents said they were not overly concerned by China's activities.
""I think it (the drill) is more like a show, it would be quite impossible (for China) to launch a real attack. Although it is still possible but it should be quite difficult for it to happen, "" Huang Chung-en told the BBC. 
Chou-Yu-Hsuan said she was ""unafraid"" as she did not think a war will happen.
""They (China) have been saying it for a long time. My feeling is that if a real war breaks out, there will be a lot of problems. Besides, there is the US,"" she added.

Made In Heaven: A show taking on all that's wrong with Indian weddings,"In India, weddings are largely grand, boisterous affairs. But a new web show casts a sceptical lens on the event, exposing some of the unsavoury realities that might lie behind the splendour. 
The second season of Made In Heaven, streaming on Amazon Prime Video, traces the trials and tribulations of a group of wedding planners who go to great lengths to help Delhi's elite experience their ""dream weddings"". 
The team is managed by Tara and Karan, who juggle their own problems along with those of the brides and grooms.  
The series is among the most-watched on the platform in India currently, and fans have hailed it for showcasing lavish weddings and stunning outfits, along with a healthy dose of drama. It has also been praised for spotlighting social customs and prejudices that impact marriages but are often not spoken about, let alone shown on screen.
""Weddings are a microcosm of Indian society. It's also that one time where all the preferences, prejudices and idiosyncrasies of a family are on display. So for writers, there's endless material: you can have social commentary, explore inter-personal relationships. People also just love watching Indian weddings,"" director Zoya Akhtar, co-creator of the show, told the BBC.
However, the show has also been criticised for its portrayal of Muslims and for not crediting a Dalit writer in an episode that allegedly draws on her work. The makers have denied the latter's allegation. 
India's obsession with marriage has often been portrayed in reality shows - such as Indian Matchmaking and Band Baajaa Bride - and popular films.
Though things are slowly changing in the metropolitan cities, marrying largely remains the norm and single people, especially women, are often pressured by their families to ""settle down"". 
A majority of the marriages in India are still arranged by families, who choose partners within the same caste and community. The institution is also seen as uniting not just two people but their families, a belief that can have a bearing on innocuous things like the wedding guest list to more serious decisions a couple may face, like choosing to have a child, call off a wedding or get divorced. 
The show spotlights some of these deep-rooted problems plaguing not just marriages but Indian society.
In one episode, a bride is constantly made aware of her ""dark skin"" by her family and is encouraged to try a treatment that will make her skin ""cleaner"" and ""brighter"" - euphemisms carefully chosen to be less offensive. The bride, in turn, cannot get herself to stop applying fairness creams even though her partner tells her she's beautiful as she is. 
In another episode, a groom's mother asks a bride if she really wants to call off the wedding, despite seeing the blood and bruises on the bride's face after her son, a life coach, kicks her in a jealous rage. (The bride decides to go ahead with the wedding after her abusive fiancé shows up outside her door, wailing and promising to ""be better"" with her help.)
Then there's a father who refuses to attend his lesbian daughter's commitment ceremony because he's afraid of what people will say, and a celebrity couple who tie the knot in an opulent ceremony in France, but more for optics and opportunity than for love. 
""Each episode in this season takes up one structural social evil that is strengthened by marriage,"" says Debashree Mukherjee, a film scholar and professor at Columbia University. ""Each episode ends with a gorgeous spectacle of a wedding but each relationship is so fraught with deep tensions that marriage as a social institution starts to unravel from within. Instead we get a vision of marriage as pure spectacle,"" she says. 
The show has also been praised for depicting a Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) wedding with aplomb, rare in mainstream entertainment. The protagonist, Pallavi Menke, who's a Dalit academic, has to fight with her upper-caste husband and in-laws to include Buddhist wedding rituals in the celebrations.  
Her in-laws are proud of her academic achievements, but not of her caste, while her liberal-minded husband is so blinded by his privilege that he's unable to see how his own family might be casteist. 
But the show has also met with criticism on some fronts; some viewers have taken offence with an episode that aims to address polygamy. 
In it, a Muslim man marries for the second time against the wishes of his first wife. One X (formerly Twitter) user criticised the show's makers for ""peddling stereotypes"" about the Muslim community. 
But Reema Kagti, director and co-creator of the show, says that one person's story isn't meant to be a representation of a community.
""When you're talking about women's empowerment, you have to look at situations where a woman's agency is being taken away,"" she says.
The drama has also found itself in another controversy after Dalit writer Yashica Dutt accused the makers of using her ""life and words"" in the Buddhist wedding episode without crediting her. The makers ""categorically denied any claim that Ms Dutt's life or work was appropriated by us"".
Sayantan Ghosh, who works in publishing, said he found the show a tad preachy and would've liked for the storytelling to be more nuanced. Film critic Sucharita Tyagi says that some of the storylines were too ""on the nose"" and sounded like a ""20-year-old trying to make it as an activist"".
But despite the controversies and the rather bleak view the show takes of weddings and relationships - many feel that it's relevant, if only to start conversations around taboo subjects. Through the warm friendship of Tara and Karan, the series also imparts one of its subtlest takes on relationships. 
Tara, who's negotiating a tough divorce settlement with her spouse, and Karan, a gay man who's struggling to come to terms with his dying mother's denial of his sexuality, are always there for each other. Through good times and bad, they have each other's backs. 
""Where there is friendship, there is love, solidarity, and companionship,"" Ms Mukherjee says.

Emmerson Mnangagwa - Zimbabwe’s ‘crocodile’ who wants another bite,"When Robert Mugabe was ousted as Zimbabwe's president in 2017, his replacement, Emmerson Mnangagwa promised a new start for his country's people.
But as President Mnangagwa seeks re-election at the polls later this month, Zimbabweans are grappling with the same problems - high inflation, poverty and a climate of fear.
The Zanu-PF leader, who is rarely seen without a scarf in the colours of Zimbabwe's flag around his neck, brushes such criticism aside, saying the nation will be ""lost"" if it fails to back him - his supporters pointing to a mining boom and other foreign investments during his time in office.
Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, he came to power after a military takeover and mass demonstrations forced Mr Mugabe, long-time leader and Mr Mnangagwa's former mentor, to resign. 
The military revolt was sparked by Mr Mugabe sacking Mr Mnangagwa as his vice-president.
Mr Mnangagwa, who lived up to his nickname and snapped back, may have unseated Zimbabwe's only ruler, but he is also associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling party since independence in 1980.
Some of his former comrades in the liberation struggle used to describe him as a ""very cruel man"".
But his children see him as a principled, if unemotional, man. His daughter, Farai Mlotshwa - a property developer and the eldest of his nine children by two wives - once described him as a ""softie"".
And as he sought to woo foreign investors and dispel his ruthless reputation in 2018, he told the BBC: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life."" 
The exact year of Mr Mnangagwa's birth is not known - but he is thought to be 80.
Born in the central region of Zvishavane, he is a Karanga - the largest clan of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community.
Long before he came to power, he was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"", a 2001 United Nations report said.
Despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, has a fearsome reputation that was cemented after independence during the civil war that broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. 
As national security minister, he was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu.
Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF.
Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres. As president he has tried to broach reconciliation. Some have felt his comments glib given the deep wounds in Matabeleland, but an initiative to allow exhumations and reburials has been agreed.
Elsewhere, he still enjoys the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against white farmers and the opposition from 2000.
They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the fight for independence in the 1960s and 1970s.
Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state torture after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo). He spent 10 years in prison.
A close friend of Mr Mnangagwa, who did not want to be named, once said: ""He has scars from that period… perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young.""
His ruthlessness resurfaced during the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central when opposition candidate Blessing Chebundo defeated Mr Mnangagwa.
During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match.
Eight years later Mr Mnangagwa reportedly masterminded Zanu-PF's response to Mr Mugabe losing the first round of the presidential election to long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai.
The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes.
Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected.
Mr Mnangagwa was seen as Mr Mugabe's right-hand man - that is until the former first lady Grace Mugabe became politically ambitious and tried to edge him out.
Their rivalry took a bizarre turn when he fell ill in 2017 at a political rally led by Mr Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa.
His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm.
Mr Mnangagwa referenced this plot himself and also blamed a group linked to the former first lady for an explosion at a Zanu-PF rally in Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayo, in which two people died.
Their rivalry has continued - and when Mr Mugabe died in 2019, President Mnangagwa wanted him interred at the national Heroes Acre burial ground, but Mrs Mugabe refused.
But his overtures on the economic front have been welcomed by some businesses.
In 2017, Zimbabwe's GDP was $17.5bn (£13.7bn) and has since averaged at $25.31bn.
The government has also attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in investment, mainly in mining. For example, platinum giant Zimplats will invest $1.8bn over the next 10 years, following negotiations with government. 
With the largest lithium reserves in Africa, the government also hopes to profit from world demand for the key component in batteries - and last month a Chinese firm opened up a lithium processing plant in Goromonzi.
The president's supporters are confident about his place in the history books, with the government renaming 10 streets Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa Rd in a 2019 project to honour African icons rather than British ones.
But critics say most changes introduced by President Mnangagwa have not benefitted the ordinary Zimbabwean.
Zimbabwe had one of the highest inflation rates in the world last month - prices in July had rocketed by 101.3% since the previous year. Unemployment also remains rife, with only 25% of Zimbabweans holding formal jobs.
His vow to guarantee human rights appears hollow, with little changing in this regard since Mr Mugabe's departure. 
Critics continue to be arrested and taken to court for insulting the president - an offence punishable by one year in jail or a fine or both. A man in Harare was charged in April after allegedly being overheard by a policeman saying that Mr Mnangagwa would lose the next election.
Members of opposition party the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) have also been convicted in the run-up to the vote on what they describe as fabricated charges aimed at weakening the party. The party says the police have banned several of its meetings since July, and nearly 100 gatherings since it was formed in January last year.
This week 40 CCC members, including an parliamentary candidate, were arrested while campaigning in the capital Harare - and remain in custody. The recent killing of a CCC backer, allegedly by Zanu-PF supporters, further raised concerns about rights. 
Mr Mugabe's removal raised hopes that Zimbabwe would rebuild its relationship with the West. 
Under Mr Mnangagwa, the country has applied to be readmitted to the Commonwealth. Mr Mugabe's government pulled Zimbabwe out in 2003 after the nation was suspended for human rights violations.
""Zimbabwe had made progress in its journey to re-join the Commonwealth family"", with an encouraging assessment visit last year, a Commonwealth Secretariat spokesperson told the BBC.
A Commonwealth observer group was also in the country to obverse the coming elections, seen as a ""significant step in the country's democratic governance"", they added.
Despite this apparent thawing in relations, Zimbabwe still remains under US economic and travel sanctions and a European Union arms embargo.
Mr Mnangagwa, however, has bolstered ties with China and Russia - and has also hosted Iran's president for a state visit last month when he said they were both ""victims"" of Western sanctions.
Civil society groups and the opposition doubt the election on August 23 will be free or fair. They also point out that 43 years in power and access to state media gives Mr Mnangagwa's Zanu-PF party a huge advantage over its opponents.
A bullish Mr Mnangagwa told supporters at a rally earlier this month: ""No-one will stop us from ruling this country.
""You will be lost if you don't vote for Zanu-PF.""

How a suicide bomb attack changed the lives of UN aid workers,"On 19 August 2003, the United Nations office in Baghdad was targeted in a suicide bomb attack. The head of the UN mission, Sergio Viera de Mello, was killed, along with 21 others, most of them staff. The attack changed the way the UN carries out humanitarian operations. It also changed the lives of dozens of UN aid workers personally affected by the blast.
In August 2003, Laura Dolci was a new mother. The Italian and her husband Jean-Selim Kanaan, both aged 33, were spending three weeks at home in Geneva, getting to know their baby son Matthia. 
Laura and Jean-Selim, UN aid workers, had met a few years earlier in Bosnia. They were, Laura remembers, ""fiercely in love - with our work, and with each other"". 
Postings to Kosovo, New York, and Geneva followed. So too did marriage and parenthood, and a new posting to Iraq for Jean-Selim.
Two days before the 2003 bombing, Laura took Jean-Selim to Geneva airport, to re-join the UN mission at the Canal Hotel in Baghdad. He arrived the following day, welcomed by colleagues with champagne, to congratulate him on the birth of his son. Jean-Selim proudly showed off photographs of Matthia.
Later, on 19 August, Canadian UN staff member Jason Pronyk arrived at the Canal Hotel for a meeting on post conflict recovery. ""It was 54C (129F) that morning,"" he remembers.
That same afternoon, Elpida Rouka, a Greek national who had been working for the UN's oil for food programme in Iraq, arrived in Baghdad from the north of the country and went to her office in the Canal Hotel. That day ""was supposed to be our last day in Iraq,"" she says.
Then, at around 16:30 local time, a suicide bomber drove a truck packed with explosives into the UN compound.
""I recall hearing a tremendous explosion,"" says Jason. ""Drifting in and out of consciousness, being carried out of the building on my door. The next memory of opening my eyes was after the second brain surgery.""
Elpida escaped with only minor physical injuries. She witnessed the chaos as people tried to rescue those trapped in the rubble. ""I was dazed and confused; we didn't have forklifts to lift the debris. It was mayhem.""
Back in Geneva, Laura was out walking with a restless Matthia in the pram. When she got home, the news from Baghdad was flashing on her computer.
""I immediately tried to call [Jean-Selim],"" she says. ""But after two or three attempts there was this constant sort of beep sound, and at that point I knew he was dead.
""I had taken him to the airport, together with our child… it took me many years to be able to use the same elevator in the airport where I last kissed him.""
It was not the first time humanitarian workers had been attacked. For example in 1996 six Red Cross medical delegates were murdered inside their field hospital in Chechnya.
But such a direct, blatant attack on the UN's headquarters, with the famous blue flag clearly flying above it, shook the foundations of the UN's own perception of itself.
Elpida says she was a ""totally bright eyed and bushy tailed"" 24-year-old. ""Thinking the UN blue flag was untouchable.""
Laura adds: ""The 19th of August was a day where we lost that innocence.""
Since 2003 there have been more attacks on the UN, and on other aid agencies. In 2007, 10 UN workers died when a car bomb targeted UN buildings in Algiers. In 2011, 18 people were killed when the UN headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria, was attacked.
In 2022 there were 235 attacks on aid workers, according to the Aid Worker Security Database, and 116 were killed.
Abby Stoddard, who works compiling the database, says the reasons for such deliberate attacks are increasingly complex.
""It can be by armed groups that have a political agenda,"" she explains. ""Or criminal gangs, and very often there is collusion between those two, and aid groups can be very attractive targets for them. They have resources and vehicles that can be looted. And they can also be kidnapped for ransom or for propaganda purposes.""
In some instances, aid agencies are targeted as a way to destabilise an already fragile country, and to provide space for a particular armed group to take control. This may have been the motivation in Baghdad in 2003. 
""By controlling or blocking or diverting aid,"" says Ms Stoddard, ""armed groups can destabilise the government, and exercise control over territories and populations"".
The events of August 2003 led to much tighter security for aid workers; in 2005 the UN set up the Department for Safety and Security, to support all UN agencies.
The changed working conditions don't always sit comfortably. T-walls (tall reinforced concrete blocks), sandbagged compounds and protective gear have become the norm, Elpida says. 
Meanwhile the UN struggles, with reduced budgets, to bring aid to 250 million people in 69 countries - ten times more than at the time of the Canal Hotel bombing, UN Secretary General António Guterres points out.
Even with the extra security, there are no guarantees. In 2017, the most recent year for which the comparison was made, the fatality rate for aid workers, says Abby Stoddard, was higher than it was for UN peacekeepers.
Mr Guterres today describes humanitarian work as being ""under attack"" from both deliberate violence and disinformation campaigns.
Now, every August, the UN marks World Humanitarian Day, dedicated to all those who have been killed working for aid agencies. 
Despite their own personal tragedies, and the increased risks, Elpida, Jason, and Laura still work for the UN.
In a way, they, together with Jean-Selim, who was Egyptian and French, embody the spirit of the UN Charter, which promises: ""We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights.""
Jason says he is thankful to be alive, and sees that day two decades ago as ""a reminder of the importance of multilateralism - to look outward"". 
Elpida, who has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, will use the day to remember ""our oath of office to the UN Charter"".
Laura chose to stay with the UN to provide ""continuity with what we were as a young family"". She doesn't believe the attacks on aid workers will deter them. 
""There is this line up of young people, with motivation,"" she says. ""Despite the news, they're ready. They're packing their bags to go. They're putting their best years, their youth, their aspiration at the service of others.""

Cat and dog influencers help Ukrainians cope with war," From fundraising to detecting explosives, cats and dogs have been helping Ukrainians deal with the devastating impact of Russia's invasion.
Patron, the mine-sniffing dog, is one of them. He works for Ukraine's state emergency service - but his mine-clearance skills and apparently disarming charisma have also earned him hundreds of thousands of followers online. 
He and a number of other animals - some real, some cartoon - have been offering emotional support and posting practical advice on their social media accounts. 
This ranges from guidance on how to deal with difficult feelings caused by war to tips on what to do when you see an explosive device.
Through his work, Patron has met numerous dignitaries and celebrities visiting Kyiv, including Lord of the Rings star Orlando Bloom, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Ukraine's postal service has printed stamps featuring the canine hero, who has also been awarded a medal for ""dedicated service"" by President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Patron's owner and handler, Mykhaylo Ilyev, says his meetings with foreign dignitaries have helped Ukraine's emergencies services secure donations of crucial mine-clearing equipment. 
The Jack Russell terrier has been involved in raising funds for people affected by war, particularly his colleagues injured while clearing mines. He has taken part in charity collections for animals too. 
""Our little friends are going through a rough time after being abandoned or injured. We realise that they also want to live and that they need help,"" Mr Ilyev tells the BBC.
Patron's account on Instagram offers not just pictures of the charismatic dog, but also hope, inspiration and advice for Ukrainians facing the horrors of war.
""Hope matters. We hope that this will be over soon. We hope that victory is near. We hope that people won't be killed anymore. Sometimes hope is all we've got,"" reads one of his posts. 
""Don't lose hope, I'm begging you. Now, let me give you a hopeful lick!""
Patron also features in a cartoon series educating children about the dangers posed by unexploded munitions.
Despite his celebrity status, Patron is still doing his mine-sniffing day job, Mr Ilyev says.
Stepan the cat hails from Saltivka, a district in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv that has been badly damaged by Russian shelling.
Before the war, Stepan was just another incredibly cute cat from the internet. But since Russia's full-scale invasion, his Instagram account started offering more than just pictures - it started to comment on the war. 
It has now switched to Ukrainian, too, even though it previously used Russian, which was widely spoken in parts of the east and south. Many people across Ukraine did the same after Russia invaded.
""We've all changed mentally after seeing what sort of thing this 'Russian world' really is,"" Stepan's owner Anna tells the BBC, referring to a concept promoted by Russia to justify intervention abroad ostensibly in support of Russian speakers.
""Ukrainian is part of my life and the life of my country and nation,"" she says.
Stepan's account, which has 1.3m followers on Instagram, has used its popularity to help animals who have suffered in the war. Last year, he helped raise almost 15,000 euros (£12,900) which was spent on food, medicine and other care for them. 
After the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine in June, the cat helped collect funds for the evacuation of animals from flooded areas. 
His account was also involved in a collection to repair a library damaged by shelling in Kharkiv.
But it is not just about the money for Stepan's account.
""He has been offering support to people, particularly children, so that they can forget the horrors of this war at least for a little while. That's why there is a bit of humour in his posts,"" Anna says.
Stepan also tackles the realities of war in his posts, including this one: ""Oh how I want my country to win as soon as possible! So that there is peace for which people on the front line have sacrificed their lives. So that there are no more missiles, so that people and animals stop dying.""
People are more receptive to advice if it looks as though it is coming from a fluffy pet, says Olena Pavlova, who created a cartoon character called Inzhyr the cat.
""A cat picture travels much further than just words. I've seen it many times,"" she tells me. ""Pictures and memes featuring cats can help deliver a lot of important ideas. They're easier to absorb. Cat pictures help us cope.""
""Inzhyr the cat is a natural anti-depressant. I created him to make myself and also my readers feel better. He's positive, cuddly and nice, and he's helping people find hope and light inside themselves,"" Ms Pavlova says.
Inzhyr's accounts on social media encourage Ukrainians to read more books and offer advice on issues such as fundraising, burnout and why everyone should be like a cat.
""Cats waste no effort, but are determined in achieving their goals,"" one of his posts reads.
Sound words of advice for anyone, whether at war or not.

Ukraine war: US allows transfer of Danish and Dutch F-16 war planes to Kyiv,"The US has approved the transfer to Ukraine of American-made F-16 fighter jets from Denmark and the Netherlands when Ukrainian pilots are fully trained to operate them. 
""This way, Ukraine can take full advantage of its new capabilities,"" a US state department spokesman said.
Ukraine praised the decision it had been pushing hard for since last year.
But it is expected to be months before Kyiv will be able to use F-16s to try to counter Russia's air superiority.
The Dutch are thought to have about 42 operational F-16s which are scheduled to be taken out of service and replaced by more advanced war planes.
Denmark is also planning an upgrade of its fleet of some 30 F-16s.
The US and its allies had earlier ruled out providing F-16s to Ukraine, fearing that this would lead to further escalation with a nuclear-armed Russia.
Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 - has so far made no public comment on the issue.
Both Denmark and the Netherlands had been given ""formal assurances"" for the transfer of their multi-role F-16 war planes, the US state department spokesman said.
The spokesman added that this would happen ""as soon as the first set of pilots complete their training"".
Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra welcomed the US decision, saying that ""this marks a major milestone for Ukraine to defend its people and its country"".
""Now we will further discuss the subject with our European partners,"" he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Danish Defence Minister Jakob Ellemann-Jensen echoed his words. 
""The government has said several times that a donation is a natural next step after training. We are discussing it with close allies,"" he told Denmark's Ritzau news agency.
In Ukraine, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov described the US decision as ""great news"". 
""Our military has proven it is filled with fast learners. We will soon prove that Ukraine's victory is inevitable. Thank you to all our partners and friends in the United States, the Netherlands and Denmark. Onward to Victory!"" he wrote on X.
An 11-member coalition of Ukraine's allies in the West is due to start training Ukrainian pilots later this month and they are expected to be ready next year.
Earlier this week, Ukraine's Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat admitted that Kyiv would not be able to operate F-16s this coming autumn and winter.
The F-16 Fighting Falcon is widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets.
It can be armed with precision-guided missiles and bombs and is able to fly at 1,500mph (2,400km/h), according to the US Air Force.
The F-16's targeting capabilities would allow Ukraine to attack Russian forces in all weather conditions and at night with greater accuracy.
Ukraine is believed to have dozens of combat aircraft - mostly MiGs - all dating from the Soviet era, and the country is currently badly outgunned by Russia in the air.
Kyiv needs modern war planes to help protect its skies from regular deadly Russian missile and drone attacks, and also to support its counter-offensive in southern and eastern Ukraine that has so far yielded limited results.

Albania: Italy pays bill for tourists' dine and dash,"In a unique act of diplomacy, Italy's government has settled the restaurant bill of four Italian tourists in Albania who left without paying.
The dine and dash in the city of Berat made headlines in both countries.
The chatter prompted Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama to raise it with his Italian counterpart, Giorgia Meloni, while she was visiting the country.
She responded by telling her ambassador to ""go and pay the bill for these idiots,"" he told La Stampa newspaper.
Italy's embassy in Albania confirmed in a statement that it had paid the bill, reportedly around €80 (£68), on behalf of its citizens.
""The Italians respect the rules and pay off their debts and we hope that episodes of this kind will not happen again,"" it said. 
Italy's agriculture minister and Ms Meloni's brother-in-law, Francesco Lollobrigida, was also on the trip to Albania and told the Reuters news agency that paying the bill was a matter of pride. 
""A few dishonest individuals cannot embarrass a nation of decent people,"" he said. 
It is unclear when the incident happened but security video of the group walking out of the restaurant and wandering into the night has gone viral on social media. 
The restaurant owner told Albania's Report TV that it was the first time customers had left his establishment without paying and said the four Italians had even complimented the food.

Canada wildfires: Residents scramble to flee fires in Kelowna and Yellowknife,"This video can not be played
WATCH: Canada wildfires: The past 48 hours in 75 seconds
An official deadline to evacuate Yellowknife as a wildfire looms on its outskirts has lapsed, as residents scramble to leave by air and road.
About 22,000 people - or roughly half the population in Canada's Northwest Territories - are now displaced in the country's worst fire season on record.
A separate blaze in the west, that threatens Kelowna, British Columbia, has grown one hundredfold in 24 hours.
Officials have warned the fires ""are very active and very unpredictable"".
""The stress of leaving your home not knowing if it will be there when you return is now a reality faced by thousands,"" Harjit Sajjan, Canada's minister of emergency preparedness, said at a news conference on Friday.
He said the federal government did not yet know the full extent of the damage wrought in what has been an ""incredibly challenging week for Canadians"".
The McDougall Creek Wildfire in Kelowna, in the western province of British Columbia, poses a particularly concerning threat to lives and properties after it grew significantly overnight.
The BC Wildfire Service said the fire, which had been mapped at 1,100 hectares early on Thursday evening, was now estimated at 6,800 hectares.
""The winds were very concerning and we didn't know where things are going,"" Mr Sarjjan told reporters.
Local BC officials declared a state of emergency on Friday morning. More than 2,500 properties have since been evacuated, with thousands more on alert to leave on short notice.
The fast-moving fire is bearing down on a city with a population of about 150,000 people, and officials are already reporting ""significant structural loss"", including in Trader's Cove in the Okanagan Valley.
""We fought hard last night to protect our community,"" West Kelowna fire chief Jason Brolund said at a news conference.
He said the actions taken to rescue members of the public and save homes in the area had been akin to ""a hundred years of firefighting all at once in one night"".
No deaths have yet been reported, but Mr Brolund said the fire remains ""dynamic"" and ""as significant today as it was last night"", a preview of what may come in the days ahead.
Juliana Loewen, a Kelowna resident who is not currently under evacuation orders, is huddling with more than a dozen other people at her home on Okanagan Lake as they await updates.
This video can not be played
Watch: 'It started raining pinecones and tree bark.'
She told the BBC how locals had watched a plume of smoke coming over the mountainside like an ""ominous cloud of destruction"" and how some on the Trader's Cove side jumped into the lake as the fire spread and exit routes were blocked.
Her brother and grandmother evacuated and came to her house after ""the fire jumped very quickly from one tree to an entire area, threatening an entire residential community"".
Roads are jammed up, businesses have shut down and neighbours are on their lawns tossing valuables into their vehicles. ""It's very apocalyptic,"" she said.
Residents are used to the fires because of Kelowna's ""California-style climate"" but the heat, dryness and wind seen in recent days had created the ""perfect conditions for a firestorm"", Ms Loewen added.
The airspace around Kelowna International Airport has now been closed to everything other than aerial firefighters.
Some 2,000km (1,240 miles) north-east, winds blowing in the Northwest Territories on Friday and Saturday could push the blaze outside Yellowknife closer towards the city and one of its highways, the Ingraham Trail.
Successful firefighting efforts have made meaningful progress in holding back the fire over the last two days, and it remains about 15km (9 miles) north-west of the city's municipal boundary.
Air tankers are flying missions day and night in an effort to further slow the fire.
The Canadian government has said enough pilots will be made available to man the evacuation flights leaving the city.
Amid accusations that some airlines are inflating prices for evacuation flights, officials have warned there will be zero tolerance on price gouging.
Some essential workers have yet to evacuate the city. Among them is Dr Lori Regenstreif, usually based out of Ontario but who has been working in the Northwest Territories over the last week. 
She said it has been surreal watching the territory's capital city go from being a hub for wildfire evacuees from other parts of the Northwest Territories earlier this week to being under its own state of emergency.
""Yellowknife is the go-to. Now Yellowknife is vulnerable,"" said Dr Regenstreif. ""It's like their mothership has gone down.""
The streets have been left deserted, and restaurants and businesses have shuttered their doors.

Patients continue to be airlifted out of hospitals as of Friday. Some of the wards are so empty, according to the doctor, that staff have been sleeping in them overnight as they wait their turn to leave.
Those who remain in the city are mostly firefighters, police officers, doctors and nurses. One pharmacy in town remains open, Dr Regenstreif said, as its owner refuses to close it.
She has also noticed a handful of others who remain in the city. ""I can't really speculate on why,"" she said, adding: ""If my home were up here, I probably wouldn't want to go either."" 
As the weekend nears, the smoke in the air has cleared up, but there is a sense of unease as the wildfire continues to burn nearby. 
""There's this calm before the storm,"" said Dr Regenstreif. ""It is a bit nerve-wracking that you know something's going to come, but you don't see any of it now.""
Nearly 1,100 active fires are burning across the country.
Experts have pointed to a warmer and drier spring than normal as the reason.
Scientists say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.

US-Japan-S Korea summit a coup for Biden but will détente last?,"The United States and China have achieved what many deemed impossible - a historic meeting between US President Joe Biden, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol. 
Mr Biden hosted the first stand-alone meeting among the three countries at the Camp David presidential retreat in the US on Friday. It's a diplomatic - but still tenuous - coup for the American leader. 
South Korea and Japan are neighbours and old US allies, but they have never been friends. 
Now, however, an increasingly assertive China has renewed US interest in East Asia. And it has brought together two countries who for decades have struggled to overcome deep historical grievances.
Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Biden praised the ""political courage"" of the South Korean and Japanese leaders.
""Our countries are stronger, and the world will be safer, as we stand together. I know that's a belief that we all three share,"" he said, while Mr Yoon said it was a ""historic day"".
In a joint statement, they said they opposed China's ""dangerous and aggressive behaviour"" in maritime disputes in the East and South China Seas.
They also agreed to hold regular joint exercises, consult each other during crises, share real-time data on North Korea and hold summits every year.
""I find the meeting at Camp David mind-blowing,"" Dennis Wilder wrote on X, formerly Twitter. A professor at Georgetown University, he managed the Japan and South Korea relationship under former President George W Bush. 
At that time, they could ""barely get South Korean and Japanese leaders to meet with us in the same room,"" he said. 
In recent months, Mr Kishida and Mr Yoon have taken tentative steps to resolve their hostilities, and strengthen ties with Washington. This once-inconceivable alliance is driven by shared concerns - the biggest of which is China.
The meeting at Camp David - also the first time foreign leaders have visited the presidential retreat since 2015 - is an attempt to ""signify and to demonstrate how seriously"" Mr Biden takes the relationship between Japan and South Korea, according to a White House spokesman.
For one, the wounds are old. 
Some may describe the two countries as ""frenemies"", but it's too trite a term to describe the deep hurt among South Koreans, including the thousands of so-called ""comfort women"" who were abducted and used as sex slaves by the Japanese army during World War Two. 
South Koreans believe the Japanese never properly apologised for the colonisation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Tokyo, however, argued that it had atoned for its historical sins in several treaties.
Any détente has always been fragile, almost akin to a game of Jenga. Even when the East Asian bloc appeared solid, a single wrong move could bring the whole edifice down. 
In 2018, a long-running court case in Seoul over Japan's use of forced labour during WW2 started a trade dispute which plunged relations between the neighbours to their lowest since the 1960s. 
But there has been progress recently, including a milestone meeting in March, offering Washington a new window of opportunity. 
But there is a good reason for the two new administrations to put their differences aside, even at the cost of political capital on the domestic front. 
This is, after all, the era of pragmatic politics - and they see a bigger threat looming. 
China's assertive posture in Asia has alarmed its neighbours. Beijing claims Taiwan, a democratically governed island, and has not ruled out the use of force to ""unify"" it with the mainland. Incursions into Taiwanese airspace and major military drills are now the so-called ""new normal"". 
There is also North Korea. which has carried out more than 100 weapons tests since the start of 2022, including firing missiles towards Japan. The war in Ukraine too has prompted many countries, including South Korea and Japan, to prioritise national security. 
All of this appears to have helped Mr Biden win where previous administrations in Washington have failed. 
""This marks a major milestone in the history of the trilateral relationship that has moved in fits and starts over the last three decades,"" said Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea foundation Chair at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
He says the three sides will aim to ""cement the gains"" they have made in the last year or so, ""while building momentum... to address a range of security challenges in north-east Asia and the Indo-Pacific region"".
That would mean signing agreements on defence, diplomacy and technology. It's already known that they will agree to hold regular military exercises, set up a new three-way crisis hotline and, crucially, pledge to meet once a year. Washington's goal then is to establish long-term ties that will last well beyond the sitting presidents.
""Biden, Yoon and Kishida have a chance to make even bigger history that lasts beyond a milestone meeting at Camp David,"" said Duyeon Kim.
""Their respective governments will need to implement their joint vision proactively and beyond their leadership terms because the Seoul-Tokyo relationship will continue to ebb and flow. If an ultra-leftist South Korean president and an ultra-right-wing Japanese leader are elected in their next cycles, then any one of them could derail all the meaningful, hard work Biden, Yoon and Kishida are putting in right now.""
And here lies the challenge.
Kurt Campbell, Deputy Assistant to President Biden and Co-ordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs, has praised the ""political courage"" of Mr Kishida and Mr Yoon, calling it ""a breathtaking kind of diplomacy"".
But a change of leadership could see a change of heart.
""Tensions that run deep, particularly in South Korea due to past historical animosities related to Japan's colonisation of Korea, do not disappear overnight, and we're likely to continue to see diplomatic spats arise, as was the case a couple of weeks ago when the Japanese ministry of defence claimed Dokdo (Takeshima islands) as its own in its national security strategy,"" said Andrew Yeo.
""Relatively low approval ratings for Kishida and Yoon back at home may limit the amount of diplomatic capital the two leaders could sink into Korea-Japan relations. I also believe at some point the two sides, and Japan in particular, will need a more thorough reckoning of its colonial past in Korea and elsewhere.""
Japan and South Korea may also not want to go as far as Mr Biden in criticising China. Fearing a backlash, they may hardly mention Beijing in their public remarks following the summit. 
And pacts involving economic measures might be harder to secure than agreements on national security. 
US-China tensions, especially economic restrictions, have come at a cost to both South Korea and Japan. China is a key trading partner for both. And companies in Seoul and Tokyo - such as Samsung and Nissan - rely heavily on Chinese workers and consumers. 
Beijing has already made its displeasure over the summit known. It will see it as yet another attempt by the US to ""contain"" its influence, no matter how much the White House denies this. It has already dubbed it a ""mini-Nato"".
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged South Korea and Japan to work with Beijing to ""revitalise East Asia"".
In July, in a video that has now been widely shared, he made an unusually blunt appeal: ""No matter how blond you dye your hair or how sharp you shape your nose, you can never become a European or American, you can never become a Westerner. We must know where our roots lie.""
While Mr Biden has - successfully perhaps - focused on building defence alliances in Asia, it has left little room for engagement with Beijing and Pyongyang.
There were signs this was changing, with a flurry of recent Beijing visits by senior US officials - Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and US special envoy on climate John Kerry.  There are also reports that Washington has approached the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with an offer of high-level talks ""without preconditions"". 
But time is running out as another US election cycle begins.

Russia sanctions UK politicians and journalists,"Russia has banned 54 British nationals and people working for UK organisations from entering the country in retaliation for UK sanctions on its citizens, its foreign ministry says.
They include Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer and International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Karim Khan.
A number of journalists from the BBC, the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian are also on the list.
The BBC said it would ""continue to report independently and fairly"".
The Russian foreign ministry said the move was in response to ""the aggressive implementation by London of a hostile anti-Russian course"".
Ms Frazer was sanctioned for ""actively lobbying for the international sports isolation of Russia"", while Minister of State for Defence Annabel Goldie was described as being ""responsible for the supply of weapons to Ukraine"".
In March the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting children from Ukraine, which Moscow denies.
Mr Khan told the BBC at the time: ""Children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported.""
The BBC journalists include chief executive Deborah Turness, presenter and analysis editor Ros Atkins and disinformation and social media correspondent Marianna Spring.
The Russian foreign ministry said it would continue to expand its ""stop list"".
Russia has already barred a number of British journalists and defence figures as well as hundreds of elected British MPs.
In June last year, the BBC's Clive Myrie and Orla Guerin were among journalists who have reported from Ukraine to be banned. BBC director general Tim Davie was also on the list. 
The UK is among Western countries to have sanctioned Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 
These include a ban on the import of goods from Russia such as diamonds, oil and gas. 
Earlier this month, the British government announced what it described as the ""largest ever UK action"" targeting Russia's access to foreign military supplies..
More than 1,000 Russian businesses and individuals have been sanctioned by the US, EU, UK and other countries.

The numbers behind Canada’s worst wildfires season,"This has been - by some distance - the worst wildfire season in Canada's history. 
This week, thousands of people in the western and northern parts of the country have been forced to flee their homes. 
Others have been told to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. 
There are over 1,000 active wildfires nationwide and two-thirds of those are classed as out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center.
In terms of acres burned, the 2023 season far outstrips all previous years.
The fires are currently burning in provinces in both the east and the west, including in the Northwest Territories and the province of British Columbia.
This summer the fires caught the world's attention when the smoke caused the air quality to plummet in many major US and Canadian cities, including New York City, Washington DC and Toronto. 
Another way of showing how bad 2023 has been for fires in Canada is to show the speed in which they spread over the summer months, compared with recent years.
The focus in the last few days has been on the Northwest Territories where one of the largest evacuation operations in Canada's history has been taking place.
Long queues of vehicles could be seen snaking down a highway out of the city of Yellowknife. 
The flights out of the city are also full, the final chance to leave ahead of a Friday deadline set by authorities to get the 22,000-strong community out of danger. 
The fires were nine miles (15km) away from the city late on Thursday and could reach the outskirts of Yellowknife over the weekend.
Hay River further south was also the scene of people fleeing. One couple told CBC News parts of their car melted in the heat.
The other wildfire hotspot is Kelowna in British Columbia where thousands are fleeing the encroaching McDougall Creek wildfire, which exploded in size on Thursday.
There has been ""structural loss"" in West Kelowna and almost 5,000 properties in the area had been told to evacuate.
Flights have been grounded at Kelowna International Airport in order to prioritise aerial firefighters.
One resident there, Alastair Richards, took this photo from his garden in the early hours of Friday.

Wildfire evacuees frustrated by Facebook news ban in Canada,"This video can not be played
Watch: Footage shows the wildfire forcing a Canadian city to evacuate.
Like many in Canada's Northwest Territories, Poul Osted has been relying on social media to keep in touch with loved ones as they scramble to evacuate from nearby wildfires. 
But Mr Osted said he has been left frustrated by his inability to share news articles on Facebook during the active emergency situation, due to Meta's ban on news content for Canadian users.
""Instead we have to screenshot parts of a news story and post that as a picture,"" Mr Osted told the BBC. 
""Oftentimes this means you don't get the whole story, or have to go searching the web for verification.""
A Canadian government minister has demanded that Meta - the company that owns Facebook and Instagram - ""reverse its decision"" as what it was doing was ""completely unacceptable"".
""Due to this ban, people do not have access to information that is absolutely crucial,"" Transport Minister Pablo Rodriguez told a briefing on Friday.
Poul Osted, who lives in the small hamlet of Fort Resolution, said the ban had affected his family members who were forced to flee Hay River, which is threatened by a wildfire is burning nearby.
""The state of the highway system is one example,"" he told the BBC via Facebook messenger. 
Several people were inquiring on the platform whether it was safe to drive out of town but couldn't share that information on the social network.  
Meta began blocking access to news for its Canadian users on 1 August, not long after Canada's parliament passed an online news bill that will require platforms like Google and Meta to negotiate deals with news publishers for content. 
It has called the law ""fundamentally flawed legislation that ignores the realities of how our platforms work"".
In response to questions from the BBC, a Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the ban and its impact on evacuees. On Thursday, the company added a safety check-in feature on the platform. 
As Meta rolls out the ban as part of its campaign against the legislation, a growing number of Canadian users have found themselves unable to view news shared by media organisations on its platforms. 
They are also unable to view articles shared by friends, instead seeing a message that reads: ""This content isn't available in Canada.""
This has raised concern about people's access to information, especially during the wildfire evacuations. 
""The timing could not have been worse for this,"" said Shawna Bruce, an instructor at the disaster and emergency management program at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. 
About 77% of Canadians use Facebook, she said, and one in four of them rely on the platform as their primary source of news.
""I am wondering if we have a bit of an information void there because of this decision,"" Ms Bruce said. 
Canada's Minister of Heritage, Pascale St-Onge, called Meta's decision to continue to block news for Canadians ""irresponsible and unreasonable"".
She too called on the tech giant to resume talks over the law and to restore access to news.
Residents in Yellowknife, the territory's largest city with 20,000 people, have been ordered by officials to leave by Friday afternoon over fears a wildfire burning about 16 km (10 miles) could reach the city limits by the weekend.
Other towns in the Northwest Territories, including Hay River and Fort Smith, are also under evacuation orders. 
Many evacuees have been using Facebook groups like NWT Wildfires Safety Check to mark themselves safe from the fires and to ask about updates. 
Officials have also relied on Facebook to share evacuation information and updates on the fires directly to their official pages and websites. 
""Some of them have really stepped up in the absence of not being able to use Facebook in a way they could before,"" Ms Bruce said. 
Meta's restriction on news has forced other jurisdictions in Canada to rethink how they disseminate essential information.
Police in Manitoba, for example, told the Canadian Press earlier this summer that it will rely on direct posts through social media accounts to get news out to the public. 
Nearly 240 wildfires are active across the Northwest Territories as of Thursday, part of what has been Canada's worst forest fire season on record. 
More than 1,000 wildfires are burning across Canada, including in British Columbia and Quebec. 
Experts have pointed to a warmer and drier spring than normal as the reason. 
Scientists say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.

"Sara Sharif murder inquiry: Father of girl, 10, sought over her death","Police have named the father, step mother and uncle of a 10-year-old girl found dead in a house in Woking as the three people they want to talk to in connection with their murder inquiry.
A global search is under way for Urfan Sharif, his partner Beinash Batool, 29, and his brother Faisal Malik, 28.
They left the UK for Pakistan on Wednesday 9 August, the day before Sara Sharif's body was discovered. 
Surrey Police also revealed Mr Sharif, 41, made a 999 call from Pakistan.
It was that call which led officers to the house in Woking where they found Sara's body with ""multiple and extensive injuries"", which were likely to have been caused over a sustained period of time. 
The 10-year-old has now been formally identified. 
A post-mortem examination carried out on Tuesday concluded the cause of death was ""still to be established"" and further tests were needed. 
Police previously said they were called to the address in Hammond Road at about 02:50 BST on Thursday 10 August ""following a concern for safety"".
There was no-one else in the house when the 10-year-old's body was discovered. 
Urfan Sharif rang the emergency services in the UK shortly after landing in Islamabad with his partner, his brother and five children. 
Det Supt Mark Chapman, from Surrey Police and Sussex Police Major Crime Team, said the five children were aged between one and 13.
He added: ""We are working with the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service), Interpol, the National Crime Agency, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office to progress our inquiries with the Pakistan authorities."" 
BBC News has spoken to a travel agent in Woking who said he was contacted by Sara Sharif's father, Urfan Sharif, at about 22:00 BST on Tuesday 8 August who said he wanted to book tickets to Pakistan as soon as possible. 
""After that I ask him what is the reason, why you booking as soon as possible, so he said my cousin has died so that why we going Pakistan,"" Nadeem Riaz told BBC News. 
The travel agent said Urfan Sharif booked eight one-way tickets for himself, his brother, his wife and five children.
The flights booked were from the UK on Wednesday 9 August, via Bahrain, and arriving in Islamabad at 05:35 local time on Thursday 10 August.
Mr Riaz confirmed the tickets were used.  
Surrey County Council leader Tim Oliver said a ""rapid review"" would be carried out to determine whether a local child safeguarding practice review should be held, which would bring together police, social care and education to review the practice of the agencies involved in the case.

Russian priest investigated for blessing Stalin statue,"A Russian Orthodox priest is under investigation after he was filmed blessing a new statue of the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. 
The incident happened on Tuesday at the unveiling of the eight-metre (26ft) monument in the city of Velikiye Luki. 
In a statement, the priest's local diocese said his actions did not represent the church's views.
Stalin ruled the Soviet Union from 1924 until 1953 and oversaw a brutal regime that tried to eliminate religion. 
According to independent Russian news site Sota, the priest admitted that while a large number of clerics were killed during Stalin's rule, this led to the creation of many martyrs. 
His diocese said that it had not approved his participation in the event and that an ""internal audit"" had been launched. 
It is estimated that tens of thousands of clergy were among the millions of people killed or sent to labour camps during Stalin's nearly 30-year communist rule.
Many churches were destroyed or forcibly repurposed, with religion seen as a barrier to a successful socialist society.
Stalinism left deep scars in Eastern Europe and many people still revile him for his brutality and intolerance.
Several statues of Stalin have been removed in Russia and it had taken three years to find a spot for this new statue, according to the state-owned Ria-Novosti news agency.
That was after the regional authorities in the city of Volgograd, which was once named Stalingrad, opposed having it there. 
However, there are a growing number of Russians who have taken a more positive view of Stalin in recent years.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials have promoted him as the leader who lead the country to victory against Nazi Germany in World War Two.

Yellowknife fires: Evacuees pack road and air routes ahead of noon deadline,"Residents of Yellowknife are scrambling to leave the northern Canadian city by air and road ahead of a noon Friday evacuation deadline.
Evacuation flights were leaving hourly and passengers were being processed quickly, officials said.
The main highway has long traffic queues with officials fearing the road could be cut off as the fire nears.
It is one of 240 fires in the Northwest Territories and was about 15km (9 miles) from Yellowknife on Thursday. 
The outskirts of the city, home to 20,000 people, could be under threat on Saturday. 
""I'm really anxious and I'm scared, I'm emotional,"" Angela Canning told Associated Press after packing her camper van with her important belongings and her two dogs.
""I don't know what I'm coming home to or if I'm coming home. There's just so much unknowns here.""
The evacuation was ordered on Wednesday because authorities fear the main road in and out of the city could be cut off well before the fire reaches the city.
Reception areas have been set up in Calgary, Alberta, to take evacuees arriving by air or road.
Nearly 7,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes in other parts of the territory and other parts of western Canada are also battling fires in the country's worst season on record.
A state of emergency has been declared in the city of Kelowna in British Columbia, where officials warn the coming days could be the ""most challenging of the summer"".
City officials said firefighters continued to work overnight to protect property and infrastructure and some ""structural loss"" is confirmed in West Kelowna.
""The fire remains very active and unpredictable,"" officials said in a statement.
In Yellowknife, a massive queue of people waiting to register for evacuation flights out of the city had formed outside a local high school on Thursday.
Amid light rainfall, police and military personnel moved down the line, handing out snacks, water and chairs.

In a briefing on Thursday evening, officials said 21 evacuation flights with nearly 2,000 seats available were scheduled for Friday, and depending on turnaround of flights and need, additional flights could be organised for Saturday.
Evacuees were advised to bring no more than five days' worth of clothing in standard carry-on bags.They said about 5,000 people need to leave Yellowknife by air.
Locals have accused Air Canada and WestJet of inflating prices for flights out of the city as well as change fees for travellers with upcoming flights into Yellowknife.
In a statement to CBC News, an Air Canada spokesman said fares for direct flights had been capped and the airline was currently doubling its regular operations in the city.
But he noted there were ""limitations being imposed on flying due to the fires"" and that Air Canada had cancelled flights on Saturday.
WestJet told the outlet it had adjusted fares to avoid ""price escalation"" and was also waiving reschedule fees for people travelling to Yellowknife in the next five days.
Other airlines have also been asked to help people flee the city.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had ""touched base"" with the city's mayor to discuss the situation on the ground.
""I reaffirmed our government's commitment to providing support both now and in the days and weeks ahead,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
About 46,000 people live in the Northwest Territories, and Canada's military has been co-ordinating the largest airlift evacuation effort in the region's history.
The communities of Fort Smith, K'atl'odeeche First Nation, Hay River, Enterprise, and Jean Marie River are all also under evacuation orders.
Kakisa, a community of about 40 people some 130km from Hay River, received an evacuation order on Thursday.
Canada is having its worst wildfire season on record, with nearly 1,100 active fires burning across the country.
Experts have pointed to a warmer and drier spring than normal as the reason.
Scientists say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.

Georgia investigates threats against Trump jury,"Officials in the US state of Georgia are investigating online threats made against members of the grand jury that indicted Donald Trump on Monday.
Personal information, including the addresses and photos of the jurors, were shared on right-wing platforms.
Fulton County Sheriff's Office said it was aware of the threats, and was trying to track down those behind them.
The names of the jurors were published in the indictment, a routine practice in Georgia.
But after their identities emerged in that document, supporters of former President Trump seemingly compiled further information available online and posted photographs and addresses to forums, including the social media site Telegram. 
It comes just days after the jury voted to indict Mr Trump on 13 charges, which include racketeering and election meddling. He has said the charges are politically motivated.
Officials said that along with jurors' personal information, threats against them were also shared. Police say the threats could amount to jury intimidation. 
""Our investigators are working closely with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to track down the origin of threats in Fulton County and other jurisdictions,"" the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.
It said they took the matter very seriously and would respond quickly to ensure the safety of jurors.
In one message shared on Facebook a user wrote: ""I thought it only fair to share a few names from that grand jury."" 
The post, which included possible addresses and phone numbers for several jurors, was later removed. 
Other messages posted by users to Truth Social, the site owned by Mr Trump, urged his supporters to ""make sure [the jurors] can't walk down the street"" and to make them ""infamous"". 
Media Matters, a non-profit organisation that monitors conservative media bodies, reported that one user called the information a ""hit list"".
Some posts reportedly include violent rhetoric against Fani Willis, the prosecutor who is overseeing Mr Trump's case in Georgia.
Two NBC News reporters who wrote about the grand jury incident also had their own purported addresses posted online, the Reuters news agency reported. 
Georgia is an outlier in the US legal system as it shares the identity of the jurors, which it says is to allow the public to have a greater faith in the legal system.
But they do not make their addresses or any other personal information public. 
Mr Trump, who is the front-runner for the Republican nomination to run for president in the 2024 election, has consistently hit out at those leading cases against him.
Earlier this month, US prosecutors reported a post that he wrote on Truth Social to a judge, claiming it was intended to intimidate people involved in a case against him. 
Meanwhile, a woman in Texas has been charged for threatening to kill a judge overseeing another case against Mr Trump.
Last week, FBI agents killed an armed man in Utah who reportedly made death threats against Joe Biden, a few hours before the president landed in the state. He came to the attention of federal agents after posting a threat on Truth Social, which then alerted the FBI.
On Thursday, a Canadian woman was jailed in the US for 22 years for sending a letter laced with ricin to Donald Trump when he was president.

Haitians flee homes in Port-au-Prince as gang violence surges,"Thousands of Haitians have fled their homes in Port-au-Prince amid soaring gang violence that has killed more than 2,400 people so far this year.
The UN said 5,000 fled the Carrefour-Feuilles district of the capital this week after gang members took control.
Local aid groups have stopped vital services as government attempts to quell the violence fell flat.
The UN Security Council will decide soon whether to send a multinational force to help restore order.
In Carrefour-Feuilles and surrounding areas where there has been months of gang warfare, a stream of residents were seen carrying suitcases or leaving with belongings strapped to their cars.
Video recorded by Reuters news agency showed women weeping beside the body of a man who gang members had killed.
Reuters said that many of those who managed to escape had gathered at a local military base demanding help against the gangs. 
Decades of instability, disasters and economic woes have left Haiti one of the poorest and most-violent countries in the world.
Gang violence has soared since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021, which led to much of the country's territory falling out of government control.
Turf wars have since driven a surge in refugees, severe food shortages, murders, kidnappings and sexual violence.
UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said on Friday that at least 2,439 Haitians had been killed, 902 injured and 951 kidnapped this year.
""Reports from Haiti this week have underscored the extreme brutality of the violence being inflicted on the population,"" she said.
She added that vigilante groups set up to counter the gangs had led to 350 people being lynched since April. Of those, 310 were alleged gang members and one was a police officer.
According to provisional figures released by one local rights group, 30 people were killed and more than a dozen others wounded in attacks in the capital on Thursday. 
The US embassy, which has already been evacuated of non-essential staff, closed down on Thursday due to sustained gunfire in the area.
Haiti's government said it would deploy ""all its forces"" to restore order to Carrefour-Feuilles. However, its poorly equipped police have struggled against heavily armed gangs.
The International Red Cross said that ""in a matter of days, violence escalated dramatically"", particularly in areas where it worked with local groups.
Roadblocks installed by warring gangs were stopping residents from getting help, it added.
Ann Lee, co-founder of US-based crisis response group CORE, which is still operating in the capital, said that many international groups had left due to increasing intimidation and violence against staff.
""We have a staff member who lost her daughter because she was having a seizure and couldn't get to the hospital,"" she said. ""We have an employee whose brother was beheaded.""
Ms Lee said there was not a single member of CORE's 100-strong Haiti team who did not know a victim of the violence. 
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council in a report on Tuesday that a ""robust use of force"" by a multinational deployment was needed to restore order and disarm the gangs. 
Kenya has expressed willingness to lead such a force. The council is due to consider the matter in the coming weeks.

Sebastian Kurz: Ex-Austria leader charged with misleading parliament,"Austria's ex-chancellor Sebastian Kurz has been charged with giving false evidence at a parliamentary committee.
Mr Kurz, who resigned in 2021, was accused of misleading the committee when asked about appointments to the state holding company.
If found guilty the former People's Party leader could face up to three years in prison.
Mr Kurz denied the charges in a statement posted to social media, calling them ""groundless"".
""We look forward to the truth finally coming to light and the accusations proving to be unfounded in court,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The allegations relate to answers Mr Kurz gave during committee hearings in 2020 and 2021, where he downplayed his role in the appointment of the head of the state holding company, Öbag.
Evidence obtained from chat messages later suggested he was significantly more involved in the process than he had suggested. 
He was first informed in 2021, while he was still in power, that he was suspected of providing false testimony. 
Mr Kurz denied the allegations at the time, accusing the committee of trying to ""twist every word in your mouth"". 
His trial will begin on 18 October and is expected to last three days, prosecutors said. His former chief of staff, Bernhard Bonelli, is facing the same charges.
In a statement on Friday officials said the pair ""are accused of giving false testimony before the so-called Ibiza committee of inquiry in the Austrian parliament... regarding the alleged corruptibility of his government"". 
Mr Kurz stepped down in October 2021, after allegations surfaced that finance ministry funds were used to manipulate opinion polls in favour of his party (OVP) that were then published in a newspaper.
At the time he called the allegations against him ""baseless"".
He became leader of the ÖVP in May 2017 and led his party to victory in elections later that year - becoming, at the age of 31, one the world's youngest ever democratically elected heads of government.
Since leaving office, he has been working as a global strategist for tech investor Thiel Capital.

Chandrayaan-3: India's lunar lander Vikram sends close-up photos of Moon,"India's space agency has released latest images of the Moon as its third lunar mission starts descending towards the little-explored south pole.
The pictures have been taken by Vikram, Chandrayaan-3's lander, which began the last phase of its mission on Thursday.
Vikram, which carries a rover in its belly, is due to land near the south pole on 23 August.
The lander detached from the propulsion module, which carried it close to the Moon, on Thursday.
The black-and-white images show close-ups of rocks and craters on the Moon's surface. One of the photographs shows the propulsion module too. 
Chandrayaan-3 and Russia's Luna-25 are among the two spacecraft headed towards the Moon's south pole and both are expected to land next week. 
Luna-25 - Russia's first Moon mission since 1976, when it was part of the Soviet Union - was launched last week and is expected to make history by making a soft landing on 21st or 22nd August, just days before the Indian touchdown. If it succeeds, Chandrayaan-3 will have to settle for being a close second in reaching the south pole.
India, however, will still be only the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.
Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said on Friday that the lander module had begun its descent to a lower orbit. 
Chandrayaan-3, the third in India's programme of lunar exploration, is expected to build on the success of its earlier Moon missions.
It comes 15 years after the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime.
Chandrayaan-2 - which also comprised an orbiter, a lander and a rover - was launched in July 2019 but it was only partially successful. Its orbiter continues to circle and study the Moon even today, but the lander-rover failed to make a soft landing and crashed during touchdown.
Isro chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath has said that the space agency had carefully studied the data from its crash and carried out simulation exercises to fix the glitches in Chandrayaan-3, which weighs 3,900kg and cost 6.1bn rupees ($75m; £58m). The lander module weighs about 1,500kg, including the 26kg-rover Pragyaan. 
The south pole of the Moon is still largely unexplored - the surface area that remains in shadow there is much larger than that of the Moon's north pole, and scientists say it means there is a possibility of water in areas that are permanently shadowed.
One of the major goals of both Chandrayaan-3 and Luna-25 is to hunt for water ice which, scientists say, could support human habitation on the Moon in future. It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations.

Ethiopia's Tigray crisis: Deaths from starvation after aid halted - official,"At least 1,400 people have starved to death in Ethiopia's northern Tigray since food aid was suspended because it was being stolen, an official has said.
The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) and the US's leading aid agency halted food aid to Tigray about four months ago.
A subsequent investigation by Tigrayan authorities found that almost 500 people were involved in the theft, the official told the BBC. 
Tigray was hit by a brutal conflict in 2020, causing famine-like conditions.
The conflict ended last November after the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) signed a peace deal brokered by the African Union (AU).
Eritrean troops fought in the conflict on the side of the Ethiopian army.
For much of the war the region was under blockade, which largely halted humanitarian aid.
AU envoy, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, said around 600,000 people died in the two-year conflict. Researchers put the hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths down to fighting, starvation and lack of health care.
WFP and USAid rallied to assist some six million Tigrayans, but announced a ""pause"" in food aid after discovering in April that their donations were being diverted to local markets. They did not say who was behind the diversion. 
""We simply could not turn a blind eye to the criminal activity and continue to deliver,"" a WFP spokesperson told the BBC this week.
The BBC has seen food with emblems of aid agencies such as the WFP and USAid on packaging at markets in cities and towns in Tigray, including the capital, Mekelle. 
However, it is unclear whether the food aid was corruptly ""diverted"" or whether it had been sold to market owners by aid recipients who were in desperate need of cash. 
WFP and USAid also announced a suspension of food aid to the rest of Ethiopia in June. 
USAid is the country's largest food donor, helping millions of people struggling because of conflict, drought and the high cost of living.
A leaked memo by an independent donor group, quoted by several media outlets in June, said there had been a ""co-ordinated and criminal scheme"" apparently orchestrated by federal and regional government entities, with military units across the country benefiting.
Ethiopia's government has said it is investigating the allegations, but its findings have not yet been released. 
Ethiopia's army has denied its troops benefited from any stolen food aid.
The Tigray interim government's commissioner for disaster risk management, Gebrehiwet Gebrezgabher, told the BBC that since food aid had been halted, 1,411 people had starved to death in three zones alone - the east, north-west and south-east.
Data from Tigray's other three zones had not yet been collated, and the death toll would prove to be much higher once this was done, Dr Gebrehiwet said.
He added that 492 suspects were under investigation, and 198 had so far been charged for their alleged involvement in the scam. 
Among the suspects were government officials, staff of non-governmental organisations, co-ordinators at camps built for people displaced by conflict, and ""partners who are distributors of the food aid"", Dr Gebrehiwet said.
""Business people, especially those who own food store and mills, are also involved,"" he added, pointing out that their investigation had almost concluded. 
The BBC visited Shire, one of the biggest towns in Tigray, to see the effects of hunger.
An anaemic mother of three, Mebrhit Hailay, said she was now forced to beg because of a lack of food.
""Most days, we eat injera [a pancake-like fermented bread] with salt. The doctors advise me to have a balanced diet, but from where do I get it?"" the 28-year-old said.
Her two children, aged five and two-and-a-half years, looked thin, their eyes sunken and their bony limbs stuck out from their clothes.
If lucky, they ate one meal a day, but on other days they went to bed hungry, Ms Mebrhit said. 
Ms Mebrhit was heavily pregnant when the BBC met her. A few days later, she told the BBC she had given birth to a baby girl who, fortunately, was healthy.  
At the local hospital, nurse Kibra Mebrahtu said that many mothers could not breastfeed because of hunger, and ""many children are near death when they are brought to this hospital"". 
""We lost four this month only. The effects of the conflict, lack of food, lack of transport, are quite evident,"" she said. 
The BBC saw eight-year-old Rahel Tewelde, with ribs exposed, at the hospital. She weighed only 10kg (22lb), the weight of an average one-year-old. 
Her mother, Hiwet Lebasi, said she believed that corruption led to the suspension of food aid.
""Had it been distributed properly, it wouldn't have stopped,"" she said. 
In June, USAid said it would resume food aid only when it was ""confident that assistance will reach the intended vulnerable populations"". 
The WFP spokesperson said the agency was speeding up efforts to resume food aid. It had, in fact, started distributing a limited amount of food in some areas to test stringent new measures being put in place to ""make sure food will not fall into the wrong hands again"". 
""WFP is deeply concerned about the impact any pause in assistance may have on the lives of the families it assists. Therefore, we're putting every practical safeguard in place to ensure food assistance reaches and is used by the intended beneficiaries,"" the spokesperson added.

Pura Luka Vega: Philippine drag queen faces backlash for Jesus act,"Christian groups in the Philippines have brought criminal complaints against a drag queen who dressed as Jesus Christ and performed a rock rendition of the Lord's Prayer. 
The complaints lodged with prosecutors accuse the performer, 33-year-old Pura Luka Vega, of ""desecrating their religious faith and patron"". 
A video of a bearded Luka performing the verse in Filipino went viral last month, causing an uproar. 
Luka defended their performance as art.
They have performed as Jesus before but their latest performance drew attention after Luka shared a video of it on X, formerly known as Twitter. 
It angered the deeply religious country, where some church leaders and lawmakers have called the performance ""blasphemous"".  
At the end of July, the Philippines for Jesus Movement, comprising Protestant church leaders, registered the first criminal complaint with the Manila Prosecutor's Office.
They accused Luka of violating Article 201 of the country's penal code - which penalises obscene publications and exhibitions and indecent shows.
A second complaint was filed this week by a Catholic group Nazarene Brotherhood. Prosecutors are yet to say if they will launch a case.
Philippines, a former Spanish colony, is predominantly Roman Catholic - nearly 80% of the country identifies as such, according to the most recent poll in February. 
Days after the video went viral, many cities, including the capital Manila, made Luka ""persona non grata"", a symbolic move declaring them no longer welcome in the city.
While it does not actually prevent Luka from entering these cities, it has cost them work, with some clubs cancelling scheduled shows. Drag queens like Luka mostly earn a living by performing in clubs. 
For decades, drag queens in the country have performed mostly as comedians, impersonating singers and actresses and delivering punchlines in stand-up shows, often at the audience's expense.
Luka is part of a new generation of drag queens who position themselves as artists using their performances to test the limits of free speech. 
But Father Jerome Secillano, spokesman of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, told the BBC that an expression of faith should contain reverence. 
""I know Pura Luka Vega said it was art... What they did was a mockery of our faith,"" he said. ""We're calling the act itself offensive, whether it's done by a man, woman, or a member of the LGBTQ community.""
In response to the backlash, Luka apologised to those who were offended by the Jesus act but defended their right to express their faith.  
""What people don't understand is that Luka grew up with a religious background [and] still practices their faith in their own way,"" said Dulcinea Zulueta, who works with Luka. Luka did not wish to speak to the BBC. 
Ms Zulueta says they have both received death threats: ""I got called an accomplice to a crime just because I supported Luka. We got messages from pastors telling us we're going to hell.""
In the past, other Philippine artists have been criticised for performances or art that some saw as offensive to the Christian faith. In 2011, visual artist Mideo Cruz drew outrage from the Catholic church for an installation that included crucifixes and phallic symbols.

Omagh bomb: Irish government accused of disrespect over inquiry,"The Irish government has been labelled ""disrespectful"" for ignoring a judge's call for a public inquiry into the Omagh bomb on both sides of the border.
Solicitor John McBurney represents some families bereaved by the 1998 atrocity.
He has called for Dublin to reconsider after a minister indicated there is no new evidence to merit a public inquiry in the Republic of Ireland.
Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, died in the Real IRA attack.
In 2021, High Court judge Mr Justice Horner recommended the UK government carry out a new investigation into whether the bombing was preventable.
He also urged the Irish government to do likewise.
Earlier this year, Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris announced that an independent statutory inquiry would be held.
Its terms of reference are currently being finalised.
On Wednesday, Peter Burke, Irish Minister for European Affairs and Defence, said a number of investigations had already been carried out in Ireland into the bombing.
He stated the Nally Report had found no significant new evidence which warranted the establishment of an inquiry, adding: ""That is our position at the moment.""
Mr Burke said Dublin would co-operate fully with the UK inquiry.
Mr McBurney, who represents some relatives in the Families Moving On victims' support group, said: ""On behalf of my clients, I wish to convey the sense of surprise and disappointment felt on hearing the indication by minister Burke during a BBC interview.
""The Nally Report did not have the necessary powers to fully probe all matters and therefore many aspects remain to be inquired into.
""Lord Justice Horner made it quite clear in a very detailed judgment that full investigation in both jurisdictions was necessary in order to fully deal with the matter.""
Mr McBurney added: ""It is essential that the Irish government must reflect urgently on how disrespectful and unsatisfactory it is to ignore the obvious need, in tandem with a statutory inquiry in Northern Ireland, to properly investigate by public inquiry all matters outstanding as elucidated in the judgment of Lord Justice Horner.
""The call is now for reconsideration of the negative position outlined by minister Burke and an indication that a tandem inquiry will be launched in the Republic of Ireland.
""It is difficult to see how all aspects can be properly probed by any other arrangement."" 
Kevin Skelton, who lost his wife Philomena in the Omagh bomb, questioned the extent to which the Irish government would co-operate with any inquiry and accused it of ""only revealing what it wants to"". 
""The bomb was made in the south of Ireland, the people who brought it in were from the south of Ireland, there was people convicted in a civil court,"" he said.
""We need the Irish government to step up to the plate, it is time to do what is morally right.""
Mr Skelton said that for him 25 years on from the tragedy ""the bomb is still going off every day"". 
He added: ""We now have a chance to have it brought to a close, people can move on and have whatever life we have left to live in relative peace. 
""Not having to worry about what comes on the TV when you switch it on because I myself can't take much more and I am sure there are families out there who feel the same.""
The Irish Department of Justice told BBC News NI ""no new evidence emerged"" following a number of reviews and investigations in the Republic which ""warranted the establishment of a public inquiry in Ireland"".
""The Irish government is anxious to ensure as far as possible, that by the end of the UK inquiry, there are no unanswered questions relating to the Omagh bombing that can only be examined in this state,"" they continued.
""The Irish authorities will fully engage with the UK inquiry in this regard.""

We're now pausing our live coverage of the wildfires in Canada.
There are hundreds of fires across the country, and the two most significant threats are about 2000km (1200 miles) apart.
In the northern city of Yellowknife, the entire town of 20,000 is being evacuated.
In the city of Kelowna (with a population of 150,000), authorities warned some structures were already lost and conditions are not improving.
You can stay up to date with our coverage in this article.
And you can click here to read about Facebook's ban on news in Canada, and how it's impacting those who are in emergency situations right now and need the latest updates.
A lot has happened so let's take a look at what you need to know about the wildfire evacuations.
Nadine Yousif
Reporting from Toronto
Some essential workers have yet to evacuate out of Yellowknife. Among them is Doctor Lori Regenstreif, who is based out of Ontario but has been working in the Northwest Territories for the last week. 
She says it has been surreal watching Yellowknife enter this state of emergency, as the city has been a hub for evacuees fleeing other fires elsewhere in the Northwest Territories earlier this week. 
“Yellowknife is the go-to,” Regenstreif says of the largest city in the Northwest Territories. “Now Yellowknife is vulnerable.” 
“It’s like the mothership has gone down.” 
She says the streets are deserted as thousands evacuate out of the city, with restaurants and businesses shuttering doors. 
Those who remain are mostly firefighters, police officers, doctors and nurses. One pharmacy in town remains open, Regenstreif says, as its owner refuses to close it.
She has also noticed a handful of others who remain in the city. 
“I can’t really speculate on why,” Regenstreif says, adding later that “If my home were up here, I probably wouldn’t want to go either.” 
As the weekend nears, Regenstreif says the smoke in the air has cleared up. But there is a sense of unease as the wildfire continues to burn. 
“It is a bit nerve-wracking that you know something’s going to come, but you don’t see any of it now.”

With his truck loaded and ready to leave, Todd Ramsay was watching the fires on the other side of the lake from his house in Kelowna, BC.
He says he watched million-dollar houses go up in flames. 
“People come down the road near our house to watch the fire, actually sitting there in lawn chairs,” he said.
Worried, Ramsay started to tell them to leave. 
That’s when the pines cones and bark started falling from the sky and fire broke out at the back of his house.
Ramsay says he got his two kids, grabbed the dog and the two cats and jumped in his truck. 
His family are lucky enough to have a place to go to in the city – his office, but many others are looking for somewhere safe to stay.
“It’s beautiful country here but it’s like California, it gets really dry. When I was a kid it would rain a lot more,"" he said.
“We worked our entire lives to build this life and our house and the fact that it could be taken away at any second is very sad.”

Emmanuel Kofi Yeboah is a resident in Fort Good Hope, an indigenous community about 500 miles from Yellowknife. 
Kofi tells me the community has been working together to protect the area and have experienced the fires.
Fort Good Hope is home to less than 600 people, and about 80% are indigenous. 
Kofi explained the area is not accessible by road: ""You can only get in by plane or boat"".
Kofi says the community finds it hard to protect itself because it has little access to outside resources.
""Not even a bigger plane can land here. If this continues there is going to be scarcity of food and patients will need to be transported to the big hospitals in Yellowknife, which means people are really at risk,"" he says.
""We are hoping and praying for some rain.""

I spoke recently with Juliana Loewen, who is based near Okanagan Lake in the Kelowna area. 
She currently has evacuees staying with her.
""It was all very apocalyptic, everyone is packing and throwing things into cars and the roads are just jammed up with people trying to get out,"" she says.
""We've been having incredible heat and dry conditions along with wind, so it's the perfect condition for fire to spread.""
Loewen said people in the area had to jump into the water to try and escape the fires.
""There were lots of boats out with spotlights, looking for people stuck in the lake.""
West Kelowna fire chief Jason Brolund has called last night one of the toughest of his career.
He said ""night turned to day"" over West Kelowna because of the orange clouds.
Brolund says someone had told him it was like ""a hundred years of firefighting all at once in one night"".
""I really think it was true... we fought 100 years of fires.""
He said they had to rescue people who had not left.
‘We fought hard last night to protect our community.""
Brolund also warned the situation ""is as significant today as it was last night"".
We're now hearing from officials from the Kelowna area in British Columbia.
They warned that Thursday night's dramatic evacuations of residents could be a preview of what’s to come in the days ahead.
Officials say they know structures were lost overnight but do not yet know how many. 
There are currently no known deaths from the fires.
Residents were warned that winds will be up today and fire activity will be aggressive.
The airspace around Kelowna International Airport has been closed to everything other than aerial fire-fighters.
A statement on the airport's website says the priority is to give these aerial firefighters the space the need to keep the community safe.
Travellers have been told to check for the latest information from their airline.
The fires around the city of 150,000 people in British Columbia are a serious threat, and authorities have warned the winds in the area are a real concern.
We've just had a federal update on the wildfires in Canada. 
The information covered a lot of issues, so let's take a look at some of the key points that were made.
Harjit Sajjan, the minister of emergency preparedness, is speaking about the state of the wildfires in Kelowna, British Columbia.
""The winds were very concerning and we didn't know where things are going,"" he says, adding the government will provide a better update when the situation is clearer.
He also encourages residents to stay tuned to guidance from local authorities to keep themselves safe. 
Sajjan says that British Columbia is hit with frequent wildfires, and the government is looking at how the danger can be managed.
A CBC reporter asks if people who bought their flights out of Yellowknife with their own funds will be reimbursed by the government. 
Many have had to purchase their own flight, as well as pay for their own gas and other travel supplies during the evacuation. 
In response, Bill Blair, Canada's minister of national defence, says the priority right now is to get people out safely. 
""No one will be left behind,"" he says. 
Blair adds that any reimbursement would have to be provided by the government of the Northwest Territories, using federal disaster financial assistance funds. He says that information would be shared with evacuees in the coming days. 
During the press conference, a reporter asked why a Yellowknife hospital hadn't been evacuated sooner.
The Minister of the National Defence of Canada, Bill Blair, said the logistics of moving people was a careful operation.
He said government officials were working with the right pace to ensure a ""very methodical, staged and careful evacuation"".
""Officials have been working very carefully to make sure [evacuation] is methodically staged,"" he said. 
Officials in Canada say the current wildfire situation is a consequence of a changing climate. 
""We see the impacts of climate change,"" says Julie Dabrusin, who is the parliamentary secretary to the minister of environment and climate change.
Dabrusin says Canada's government is working on fighting these impacts for now and in the future. 
This includes giving the Northwest Territories C$13m over five years to help the territory buy wildland firefighting equipment and train more personnel.
Canada says it has also partnered with the International Association of Firefighters to help train more people. 
Canada's minister of emergency preparedness, Harjit Sajjan, has just spoken and says this has been an ""incredibly challenging week for Canadians"".
He says the wildfire situation in western Canada remains very serious and is escalating rapidly, as seen in the Kelowna area of British Columbia, many of whom were put under evacuation orders yesterday. 
""These fires are very active and very unpredictable,"" he says, adding the government does not know yet the full extent of the damage already done. 
""The stress of leaving your home not knowing if it will be there when you return is now a reality faced by thousands,"" Sajjan says. 
We are now receiving an update from federal authorities on the situation in Yellowknife.
Half of Canada's Northwest Territories population has been displaced by the wildfires, officials said, roughly 22,000 people.
Stay with us as we bring you the latest updates.
Flights out of Yellowknife will leave every hour, according to a new update from authorities.
The Northwest Territories government has just released a notification letting residents know they should head to Sir John Franklin High School and prepare for a flight out of the city.
Residents were told to bring snacks and water in anticipation of ""extended"" wait times.
People are asked to only bring a single carry-on bag with no more than five days' worth of clothing. 
Pets will be allowed on flights.
As you can see from the chart below, Canada is experiencing a record year for wildfires.
The comparison goes all the way back to 1983, which had a relatively minuscule amount of fires.
""It is by far the worst forest fire season in our history... it is an incredibly difficult year,"" says Canada's federal minister for environment and climate change, Steven Guilbeault.
Evacuees from Yellowknife who managed to get out say they feel a mix of relief, stress and pain after being forced to leave their homes behind. 
Beatrice Bernhardt, a woman in her 70s who arrived at the Calgary airport with her husband on Thursday, told The Canadian Press that all she could see over the last few weeks in Yellowknife was smoke. 
She said she broke down in tears before boarding her flight. 
""It's just a relief to feel safe,"" she said. ""But it's also very painful of what you're leaving behind.""
Another Yellowknife resident, Alice Liske, left the city earlier on Tuesday with her six kids to escape the poor air quality from the wildfire smoke. 
On her way to her aunt's house in Edmonton, Liske told CTV News that she worried about the possibility of thousands getting out of Yellowknife in just a few days. 
""Not only that, but when we go back - what will be there for us?""

Hawaii wildfires: Resident films moments before family home overcome by flames,"This video can not be played
A Hawaii resident filmed the moments before his family home was overcome by fire in Lahaina, on the island of Maui.
Ronnia Pilapil shared two videos with the BBC saying he felt lucky just to be alive.
After sending his wife and nine-year-old away, Mr Pilapil, 38, had tried to fight the flames himself using a garden hose.
But when the wind became so strong that the water started to fly back into his face, he decided to run away to safety.

Chandrayaan-3: Indian lunar lander Vikram inches closer to Moon,"India's third lunar mission is inching closer to the Moon's little-explored south pole where it aims to set down a lander and rover on 23 August.
On Thursday, the lander detached from the propulsion module, which carried it close to the Moon, beginning the last phase of its mission.
Chandrayaan-3, however, may not be the first to land near the south pole if it's beaten by a new Russian mission.
Luna-25, launched last week, is expected to land a day or two earlier.
If the Russian spacecraft - the country's first Moon mission since 1976 comes in nearly half a century when Russia was part of the Soviet Union - is successful in making a soft landing on 21st or 22nd August as planned, Chandrayaan-3 will have to settle for being a close second.
India, however, will still be only the fourth country to achieve a soft landing on the Moon after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.
Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) said that on Friday, the lander module would begin its descent to a lower orbit. Called Vikram - after Isro founder Vikram Sarabhai - the lander carries within its belly a rover named Pragyaan, the Sanskrit word for wisdom.
Chief of India's first Moon mission Mylswamy Annadurai told the BBC that after Thursday's separation from the propulsion module, the lander will do two manoeuvres over the next few days, getting closer to the Moon with each one, and will reach an orbit of 30km by 100km a day before it lands.
Once it lands, he says, it will take a few hours for the dust to settle after which the six-wheeled rover will crawl out and roam around the rocks and craters on the Moon's surface, gathering crucial data and images to be sent back to Earth for analysis.
With the Indian and Russian missions aiming to land within days of each other, some space watchers are describing it as a ""mini space race"". 
Russia launched Luna-25 on 10 August, but propelled by the much more powerful Soyuz rocket, it escaped the Earth's gravity in no time and reached lunar orbit on Wednesday, the Russian space agency Roscosmos announced. 
Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July, but it went around the Earth a few times before entering the lunar orbit on 5 August. The spacecraft has been orbiting the Moon since then, while preparing for the landing.  
Isro, however, told the BBC it's not a race and the two nations will have a new 'meeting point' on the Moon.
""Isro has never been in any race right from the day one of its inception in 1960s,"" an Isro spokesman told me. 
""We planned the mission based on the readiness of the spacecraft and the available technical window to reach the far side of the Moon. Luna-25 is also a mission planned long time ago. They also must  have some technical considerations, which we don't know precisely,"" he said.
Chandrayaan-3, the third in India's programme of lunar exploration, is expected to build on the success of its earlier Moon missions.
It comes 15 years after the country's first Moon mission in 2008, which discovered the presence of water molecules on the parched lunar surface and established that the Moon has an atmosphere during daytime.
Chandrayaan-2 - which also comprised an orbiter, a lander and a rover - was launched in July 2019 but it was only partially successful. Its orbiter continues to circle and study the Moon even today, but the lander-rover failed to make a soft landing and crashed during touchdown.
Isro chief Sreedhara Panicker Somanath has said India's space agency had carefully studied the data from its crash and carried out simulation exercises to fix the glitches in Chandrayaan-3, which weighs 3,900kg and cost 6.1bn rupees ($75m; £58m). The lander module weighs about 1,500kg, including the 26kg-rover Pragyaan. 
Once the craft entered the Moon's orbit on 5 August, scientists gradually began reduced the rocket's speed to bring it to a point which will allow a soft landing for Vikram.

Watch: The moment India launched historic Moon mission
The rover is carrying instruments which will focus on finding out about the physical characteristics of the surface of the Moon, the atmosphere close to the surface and the tectonic activity to study what goes on below the surface. 
The south pole of the Moon is still largely unexplored - the surface area that remains in shadow there is much larger than that of the Moon's north pole, and scientists say it means there is a possibility of water in areas that are permanently shadowed.
One of the major goals of both Chandrayaan-3 and Luna-25 is to hunt for water ice which, scientists say, could support human habitation on the Moon in future. It could also be used for supplying propellant for spacecraft headed to Mars and other distant destinations.

Can Zimbabwe become the new 'lithium valley'?,"This video can not be played
Efforts to develop more renewable energy sources means there’s a growing demand for batteries – particularly in the car industry, as it shifts towards electric vehicles.
A key component of batteries is lithium and African countries are set to play a huge role in this vital supply chain. 
Zimbabwe has Africa's largest lithium reserve and hopes to become the world's largest exporters of lithium.
In July of this year, a Chinese mining company completed the $300m construction of a lithium mine in Zimbabwe.
But with elections approaching, how important will this key resource be for Zimbabwe’s economy and the president's international relationships?
The BBC's Nyasha Michelle explains.

Belfast: All-Ireland funding sought for new Lagan bridge,"Belfast City Council is to seek all-Ireland funding for a new bridge across the River Lagan from Sailortown in north Belfast to the Titanic Quarter.
The bridge has been identified as a priority in a bid for funding available through the Shared Island Initiative.
That initiative has already provided Irish government funding for a range of cross-border projects.
The proposed bridge would be matched by a similar bridge in Cork as part of a partnership between the cities.
A footbridge over the Lagan Weir in Belfast city centre, close to the Queen's Bridge, was opened almost 30 years ago in 1994.
It was rebuilt and widened in 2015 at a cost of £5m.
But plans for a similar pedestrian and cycle bridge from the old gasworks in the city centre to Ormeau Park have seen little progress in over a decade.
In 2022, the councils in Belfast and Cork were awarded development funding of 90,000 euros (£77,000) for initial work on joint projects to help regenerate the docklands in both cities.
Sailortown, on the north side of the River Lagan, is an historic part of Belfast between the river and the M2 motorway.
More recently a number of office and apartment blocks have been built in Sailortown, but there has been some regeneration of historic buildings in the area.
According to documents presented to a Belfast City Council committee, a bridge from Sailortown to Titanic Quarter has been ranked as a top priority by a council taskforce developing the city's waterfront.
The council document said the bridge would ""improve connections between the Sailortown community and the Queen's Island economic opportunities, re-stitching the original ship-building facilities at Clarendon Dock with maritime facilities on the eastern quays"".
The proposed foot and cycle bridge would also enable a ""Harbour Loop"" route for cyclists and walkers on both sides of the Lagan.
However, the estimated cost of constructing the bridge and a proposed timescale is not yet clear.
If councillors approve the plans, Belfast and Cork will submit detailed proposals to the Shared Island Fund outlining the potential of the new bridges in each city.
That proposal will include ""a feasibility assessment outlining the project steps to delivery including funding requirements"" according to the Belfast City Council documents.

Drone attack hits building in central Moscow,"Russian officials have accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on a building in Moscow, causing an explosion that was heard across the city's business district.
Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said air defences had shot down the drone with its debris falling on the city's Expo Center.
It marks the latest in a series of such attacks on the Russian capital. 
Unverified footage on social media appeared to show thick grey smoke rising into the night sky over Moscow.
There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but officials in Kyiv have never formally acknowledged launching attacks on targets in Moscow.
The attack occurred at around 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT), Russia's defence ministry said on Telegram. 
It said that, after activating the city's air defence systems, the drone had ""changed its flight path"", falling on a non-residential building on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment, an area of Moscow which hosts a number of government buildings. 
It added that there were no initial reports of casualties. 
The Expo Center is a large exhibition space used for conferences and conventions and is situated less than 5km (3.1 miles) from the Kremlin.
A witness who was in the area told Reuters news agency the attack had caused ""a powerful explosion"". 
The Russian defence ministry said the debris had not caused a fire, while Mr Sobyanin said the drone had caused ""no significant damage"" to the building.
One Russian state-owned news agency, Tass, reported that one of the outer walls of the centre had partially collapsed, citing emergency services. It said the affected area was around 30 sq m (323 sq ft). 
Moscow's Vnukovo Airport also closed following the incident, Tass said, but reopened a short time later. 
Until earlier this year, Moscow remained untouched by the war in Ukraine, but in recent months has been targeted by drone strikes. 
On 30 May, several buildings were reported damaged in a wave of strikes.
On 30 and 31 July, two separate drones crashed into the glass facade of a skyscraper just a few hundred metres from the Expo Center. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the time that the war was ""returning to the territory of Russia"" and that this was an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"".
Hours before the latest strike in Moscow, a Ukrainian sea drone was destroyed during an attempted attack on Russia's naval fleet in the Black Sea, Russia's defence ministry said.

"Private jet crashes onto Malaysia highway, killing 10","A private jet has crashed into a car and a motorbike on a highway in Malaysia, killing at least 10 people, police say.
All eight people on the aircraft died along with two motorists on the ground.
The jet exploded into a fireball on impact, with thick black smoke seen rising from the site, video clips from the scene showed.
It was travelling from the resort island of Langkawi to Selangor, west of the capital Kuala Lumpur.
Officials said the Beechcraft Model 390 aircraft had lost contact with the air traffic control tower before it crashed on Thursday.
""There was no emergency call, the aircraft had been given clearance to land,"" Hussein Omar Khan said. 
A local politician was one of the eight people killed onboard the small airplane when it crashed, according to its flight manifest.
However, Transport Minister Anthony Loke refused to identify the fatalities pending forensic test results at a local hospital.
Pilot Shahrul Kamal Roslan, survived by his wife and four sons, was one of the victims of the crash. 
Outside the hospital, Mr Shahrul's 67-year-old mother Mahanum told local media in tears that when they last talked, her son told her: ""I love you, mama.""
Malaysia's civil aviation authority said an initial investigation showed the plane had been cleared for take-off and that the two pilots were experienced. 
Investigators are working to find the plane's black box or flight data recorder.
""For now we cannot say what was the cause of the crash since investigations are underway,"" Mr Loke said.
A witness told Reuters that he had been working on site as an engineer when he heard an explosion. He went to where the crash happened and saw injured people. 
Mohamad Syahmie Mohamad Hashim, a former member of the Malaysian Air Force, told AFP that he saw the plane flying erratically.
""Not long after that I heard a loud boom,"" he said. ""I sped towards the location and saw the remains of an aircraft. I couldn't do anything.""

Hawaii wildfires: Maui emergency chief quits after sirens criticism,"This video can not be played
Watch: Ronnia filmed his neighbourhood moments before his family home was destroyed by flames
Maui's emergency management chief has quit a day after defending his agency's failure to activate its alarm system in last week's fatal wildfire.
Herman Andaya, who had no prior experience in emergency management, cited ""health reasons"" for resigning. 
In the days since, residents of the Hawaii island have told the BBC a stronger emergency response could have saved more lives. 
At least 111 people have been declared dead. More than 1,000 remain missing. 
Maui's sophisticated system, which includes 80 sirens around the island, is tested on the first of every month, its 60-second tone a normal part of life in Lahaina. But on the day of the fire, they remained silent.
On Wednesday, Maui Emergency Management Agency boss Mr Andaya insisted he did not regret that decision.
He said he had feared the sirens - most often sounded for tsunamis - would have sent some in Lahaina running to higher ground, potentially into the path of the fast-moving blaze. 
But in Lahaina on Thursday, none of the residents who spoke to the BBC accepted this explanation, saying the siren would have provided a crucial warning of the approaching danger. 
On the day of the fire, many in Lahaina were home, without power, because of the strong winds caused by nearby Hurricane Dora. And a text alert sent by the county was missed by many residents who had lost service. 
""The sirens should have been sounded,"" said Sherlyn Pedroza in Lahaina. Ms Pedroza, 20, lost her family home in the fire last week. 
""It would have alerted at least some people stuck at their house - work was off, school was off - it would have alerted them to get out."" 
As she finished speaking, Ms Pedroza and her friend, Heather Tabilin spotted a neighbour from Lahaina, Alfred ""Uncle Al"" Dasugo, who they had not seen or heard from since the fires. They ran to him crying and hugged him. ""We didn't know if you made it,"" Tabilin said. Uncle Al just smiled. 
Driving to Lahaina on Thursday along Maui's scenic Honoapiʻilani Highway, signs of the town's destruction were gradual. 
Traffic lights went dark about 5 miles from the town's centre. Another mile along, the charred shell of a car sat off the side of the road, facing out towards the sea, the first real clue of what lay ahead. 
Military and police patrolled the streets, guarding checkpoints surrounding the hardest-hit areas of the historic town. 
What was once a bustling strip mall, complete with a nail salon, a hairdresser and an ice cream shop, is now a makeshift operations centre, its car park filled with tents of aid - 8ft tall piles of nappies, 6ft tall stacks of bread. 
Lahaina residents like Ms Pedroza were among the volunteers.  
Standing among the crowd was Ronnia Pilapil, a resident of Lahaina, loaded down with clothes, rice and toilet paper for his family, now staying in a nearby hotel. 
Last Tuesday, Mr Pilapil, 38, watched as his family home - a light blue bungalow with a wide front yard - was consumed by fire. 
He had stayed behind, sending his wife and nine-year-old daughter away while he tried to fight the flames himself using a garden hose. But the wind became so strong the water started to fly back into his face. ""That's when I knew it was going to be bad,"" he said. ""So I just ran."" 
He looked back once he reached higher ground to see his house destroyed. But Mr Pilapil said he felt lucky just to be alive. 
""People died trapped in their homes. That's all I'm thinking about,"" he said. 
When asked about US President Joe Biden's visit scheduled for Monday, most residents who spoke to the BBC simply shrugged. One said he worried Mr Biden and his entourage would be ""disruptive"" to ongoing emergency operations. Others, like Ms Pedroza, said they wished it had been sooner.
Nine days after the disaster, many in Lahaina seem focused on the future, rebuilding their homes and their town. 
Despite the timeline - many said they expected the reconstruction to take several years - none said they had any plans to leave, to try life somewhere new. 
""This is all I've ever known, this is my home,"" said Ms Pedroza. ""Nobody's selling. We want Lahaina back, and we're going to get it.""

Evergrande: China property giant files for US bankruptcy protection,"Property giant Evergrande has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US as the real estate crisis in China deepens.
It will allow the heavily-indebted company to protect its assets in the US as it works on a multi-billion dollar deal with creditors.
Evergrande defaulted on its huge debts in 2021, which sent shockwaves through global financial markets.
The move comes as problems in China's property market add to concerns about the world's second largest economy.
China Evergrande Group made the Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection filing in a New York court on Thursday.
Chapter 15 protects the US assets of a foreign company while it works on restructuring its debts.
Evergrande did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the the BBC. 
The group's real estate unit has more than 1,300 projects in more than 280 Chinese cities, according to its website.
Its other businesses include an electric car maker and a football club. 
Evergrande has been working to renegotiate its agreements with creditors after defaulting on its debt repayments.
With debts estimated to total more than $300bn (£235bn), it was the world's most heavily indebted property developer.
Its shares have been suspended from trading since last year.
Evergrande revealed last month that it lost a combined 581.9bn yuan ($80bn; £62.7bn) over the last two years.
Last week, another major Chinese property giant, Country Garden, warned that it could see a loss of up to $7.6bn for the first six months of the year.
Some of the biggest companies in China's real estate market are struggling to find the money to complete developments.
""The key to this issue is to complete unfinished projects because this will at least keep some of the financing flowing,"" said Steven Cochrane of economics research firm Moody's Analytics.
He added that many homes are pre-sold but if construction stops, buyers no longer make mortgage payments, which puts more strain on developers' finances.
Earlier this month, Beijing said that China's economy had slipped into deflation as consumer prices declined in July for the first time in more than two years.
Weak growth means China is not facing the rising prices that have rattled many other countries and prompted central bankers elsewhere to sharply increase borrowing costs.
The country's imports and exports also fell sharply last month as weaker global demand threatened the recovery prospects of the world's second-largest economy.
Official figures showed exports fell by 14.5% in July compared with a year earlier, while imports dropped 12.4%.
Earlier this week, China's central bank unexpectedly cut key interest rates for the second time in three months, in a bid to boost the economy.

Ecuador election: Narco politics rule ahead of polls,"The Whatsapp message arrived on a Sunday night.
""Good evening Franki, this is the Jalisco New Generation [Mexican drugs cartel],"" the message read, in barely legible Spanish. ""If you block me, you'll get into problems. I need $6,000 [£4,710] - I'm watching you, your wife and kids.""
Franklin Torres, a banana producer, ignored it - then, a few days later, another message arrived, this time sent to Franklin's wife: ""Tell your husband to get his act together, we are writing from prison and there are people watching at the window.""
While he reported the threats, Franklin has little faith things will get better. 
As president of Ecuador's National Federation of banana growers, he is pressuring the government to allow them to carry weapons to protect themselves. 
""In the country it's hard, we don't have 911, or police patrol,"" he says. ""It's better for good people to have weapons, not just those who are bad."" 
Ecuador is the world's biggest banana exporter and the industry is a lucrative one - banana crates are a favourite mode of transporting cocaine among drugs cartels, from Ecuador's ports and on to Europe and beyond. 
Mexican and Colombian cartels have infiltrated local gangs in Ecuador as they vie for lucrative drugs routes. Once one of the most peaceful countries in South America, Ecuador was hit hard by Covid and cartels have taken advantage of a country broken by the pandemic - and by corrupt politics. 
In the first six months of the year, there were 3,568 violent deaths in the country, according to the National Police. That was up more than 70% on last year.
And as the country heads to the polls in the first round of presidential elections on Sunday, crime is at the forefront of everyone's minds, especially after last week's assassination of one of the candidates, Fernando Villavicencio.
""[Villavicencio's murder] was a terrifying tragedy,"" says political consultant Oswaldo Moreno. ""It marks an inflection point in which the politics of death is now very much part of the culture here.""
There's no more powerful example of that than Guayaquil, Ecuador's biggest city and home to the country's largest port. It's become the epicentre of the country's crime problems as cartels take advantage of its location and logistics to move drugs out of the country.  
Presidential candidate Daniel Noboa chose Durán, one of the worst-hit areas of Guayaquil, for his final campaign event on Thursday. But he did so wearing a bullet-proof vest. Along the way, there was a nearby shoot-out which sent everyone into a panic - such is daily life in this crime-ridden city.
""We need to change the state of security in Ecuador,"" he told the BBC ahead of the event, adding that his priority if he became president would be tackling unemployment. ""The problem is that by not giving people opportunities, we're feeding these organisations with young new members.""
But it's a mammoth task for a poor country like Ecuador - and it's a losing battle against the lucrative drug trade. 
In Durán, a curfew has been introduced after a surge in crime. Police checkpoints are set up along routes popular with drug traffickers but police are poorly equipped compared with the drugs gangs. 
In some parts of the city, it feels like a war zone. In one district, a police station has sandbags piled up in the windows, put in place after gangs attacked them. In another, nearly 20 patrol cars are sat rusting in the car park. Captain Victor Quespás Valencia explains they just don't have the money to fix them.
""Gangs want to win territory. We're dealing with very violent deaths - people being found hanging from bridges or cut into pieces,"" he explains. ""International criminal organisations are recruiting people here - but they have lots of money. There's a total imbalance between organised crime and the police trying to stop it.""
So will these elections make a difference to Ecuador's future? This vote is being held a year and a half earlier than planned after President Guillermo Lasso dissolved the National Assembly by decree to avoid an impeachment vote. The fear is that amid political chaos, violence could get in the way of democracy. 
""Cartels are criminal organisations that don't have an ideology,"" says organised crime expert Pedro Granja. ""They are criminal organisations moving illicit goods, they follow the same logic as a company. They are doing a market study at the moment - then we'll see whether if they want to, they can paralyse the elections.""
Regardless of elections, they're paralysing people's lives. Angie Fuentes lives with her four children in Durán. The bars on all the windows in this neighbourhood tell you all you need to know about the lack of security.
The past few years have been tough for Angie - her father died from Covid and Guayaquil was hit hard. Bodies were piled up in the streets with authorities unable to deal with the huge numbers dying.
But while the Covid vaccine helped curb the spread of the virus, criminal gangs are now offering a new type of vacuna as they call it - hand over money that the criminals demand and in return for being extorted, you get immunity from the violence.
Not that it's so straightforward. Last month a neighbour was shot dead outside his daughter's school so Angie pulled her children from having to attend - but authorities refuse to offer virtual lessons from home despite the dangers.
""All I want is security,"" says Angie. ""That's the only thing that will allow us to take our children to school without running the risk of being hit by a stray bullet."" 
It's a war that experts say has no end, especially when demand for cocaine in Europe and as far afield as Australia has soared.
""You can end civil war and war between countries,"" says Pedro Granja. ""But putting an end to drug-trafficking is totally impossible - people will carry on taking drugs.""

Britney Spears' husband Sam Asghari says their marriage is over,"Britney Spears' husband Sam Asghari has said the pair have decided to end their ""journey together"" after 14 months of marriage.
A divorce petition filed on Wednesday and seen by BBC News cited ""irreconcilable differences"" between Mr Asghari, 29, and Ms Spears, 41.
The couple got engaged in September 2021 and were married in a small but star-studded ceremony in June 2022.
Rumours of their marital struggles were reported in US tabloids this year.
Ms Spears became a global superstar after her song  ...Baby One More Time was released when she was just 16. She went on to have hits including Toxic, Womanizer and Oops!...I Did It Again.
In a post on Instagram, Mr Asghari said: ""After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together. 
""We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. 
""Shit happens. 
""Asking for privacy seems rediculous [sic] so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.""
Representatives for Ms Spears have not yet commented.
The musician did not address the divorce in a Wednesday night post to her 42 million Instagram followers, instead writing that she was ""buying a horse soon"".
According to the dissolution of marriage petition filed by Mr Asghari in Los Angeles County Superior Court, he asks that spousal support and attorneys' fees be paid by Ms Spears.
The Iranian-American actor, model and fitness trainer met Ms Spears while she was shooting the video for her song Slumber Party in 2016.
He was a vocal supporter of her efforts to end her father Jamie's conservatorship, a fight she won just months before their marriage.

Watch: Sam Asghari talks marriage, family and public support for Britney Spears
Their wedding last year, at the superstar's home in Thousand Oaks, California, was an intimate and lavish affair attended by celebrities including Paris Hilton, Madonna and Drew Barrymore.
The two had recently been seen without their wedding rings in public.
The separation comes as Ms Spears prepares to publish her memoir - The Woman in Me - this October.
It marks the end of her third marriage.
In 2004, she married childhood friend Jason Alexander for 55 hours in Las Vegas, before she annulled the nuptials at the urging of her management team.
Mr Alexander, who was seen participating in the pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol in Washington DC in January 2021, attempted to crash Ms Spears' wedding to Mr Asghari hours before they tied the knot.
He was charged with trespassing, vandalism and two counts of battery, and has been court-ordered to stay away from her.
Ms Spears' second marriage - to rapper Kevin Federline - lasted from 2004 to 2007. Mr Federline retains sole custody of their two children, Jayden James and Sean Preston.

Canada wildfire: Evacuees flee Yellowknife as fire nears northern city,"This video can not be played
Watch: A dramatic helicopter rescue for three hikers trapped by wildfire in Canada
Thousands of people fleeing a wildfire on the outskirts of Yellowknife, one of the largest cities in Canada's north, have crowded into the local airport and the road out of town.
Hundreds have also lined up for emergency military evacuation flights.
Local officials have given the 20,000 residents of Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, a deadline of noon Friday (18:00 GMT) to leave.
As of Thursday, the fire was within 16km (10 miles) of the city.
The Northwest Territories declared a state of emergency late on Tuesday as it battles nearly 240 wildfires.  
""Very tough days ahead - with two days of northwest to west-northwest winds on Friday and Saturday, which would push fire towards Yellowknife,"" the territorial fire service said in a statement on Facebook.
There have been reports of long lines at petrol stations in the city and on the road out of town.
Resident Bill Braden told Global News he was carrying extra petrol with him after a family member told him the line at one gas station stretched a kilometre in length.
Police advised drivers to slow down as they reach Fort Providence, about 300km southwest of Yellowknife by road, as a long queue for gas was affecting traffic.
For those not staying with friends or family in other communities, the closest centre for evacuees is 1,100km south of Yellowknife. 
Military evacuation flights are scheduled throughout the afternoon and evening on Thursday, with five flights to Calgary, in the neighbouring province of Alberta. 
The federal transport minister has also assured evacuees that the country's largest airline, Air Canada, is capping the cost of flights out of Yellowknife. 
Air Canada has added two extra flights out of the city. 
Shane Thompson, environment minister for the Northwest Territories, told reporters on Wednesday that the fires had ""taken another turn for the worse"" and represented a ""real threat"" to Yellowknife, the region's capital.
""I want to stress that the city is not in immediate danger,"" he said. ""[But] you put yourself and others at risk if you choose to stay.""
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the wildfire situation in the northern territory. 
Some residents of Yellowknife had already begun leaving earlier on Wednesday after parts of the city were put on evacuation alert, meaning they could be asked to leave at a moment's notice. 
""Watching the flights sell out and the prices go up I just kind of got to a point where we should leave,"" Ashley Maclellan, who fled south to Edmonton with her baby, told the CBC. 
Another fire is threatening the community of Hay River. 
One evacuee told the CBC her car began melting as she and her family drove through embers while fleeing that town over the weekend. 
Hay River Mayor Kandis Jameson pleaded with anyone remaining in the town to leave immediately. 
The fire moved 30km in a few hours because of strong winds earlier this week, closing the only two highways out of the town. Then it stalled about 10km away from the town. 
Resident Lisa Mundy described how her bumper had begun to melt, her windscreen had cracked and her car had filled with smoke as she and her husband left the town with their two children on Sunday.
""You couldn't see anything - we were driving through embers,"" she said. 
About 46,000 people live in the Northwest Territories, and Canada's military has been co-ordinating the largest airlift evacuation effort in the region's history.
The communities of Fort Smith, K'atl'odeeche First Nation, Hay River, Enterprise, and Jean Marie River are all also under evacuation orders. 
Kakisa, a community of about 40 people some 130km from Hay River, received an evacuation order on Thursday.
Kofi Yeboah, a social worker in Fort Good Hope, about 800km northwest of Yellowknife, said his community has had some smoky skies from the fires in the territory. 
""We are all praying we get as much rain as we can,"" he told the BBC. 
Canada is having its worst wildfire season on record, with nearly 1,100 active fires burning across the country as of Wednesday. 
Experts have pointed to a warmer and drier spring than normal as the reason.
Scientists say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.

"Abused and stalked, US election workers are bracing for 2024","As former US President Donald Trump and his allies face charges of plotting to overturn vote results in the state of Georgia, poll workers say false claims of ballot fraud have had an enduring impact on their lives and the country. It shows no sign of abating for next year's general election.
Chris Harvey had just worked the most exhausting months of his life helping to run Georgia's 2020 elections when he got a call on 4 January 2021 that someone was threatening him and his family. 
""We hope you enjoyed this holiday because it will be your last,"" read the threat, posted on the dark web with a picture of Mr Harvey's home and address. 
Mr Harvey, a law enforcement official turned elections director for Georgia's secretary of state, immediately thought of his wife and four children at home. 
""I wasn't really worried so much for my safety as I was for my family, and stuff that might happen when I wasn't around,"" he told the BBC. ""There's only so much that you can do."" 
Mr Harvey is one of several Georgia officials who found themselves at the centre of 2020 election fraud allegations perpetuated by Mr Trump and his campaign team as they sought to challenge their loss in the battleground state to Joe Biden. 
The former president and 18 others are now facing 41 charges from Fulton County prosecutors related to the alleged plot. Mr Trump has denied the allegations and accuses the district attorney of a politically motivated hit job. 
Unsubstantiated claims of election fraud in 2020 led to stalking, intimidation and death threats for hundreds of election workers across the country. 
Those who fell victim say the allegations have ushered in an era of harassment for vote workers. 
""Election officials are getting beat up left and right,"" said Mr Harvey. ""Law enforcement has gotten better, but has been slow to recognise that threats against election officials are really threats against the entire process, and so they need to be taken just as seriously as anything else."" 
In the Peach State, some of Mr Trump's alleged co-conspirators are charged with targeting election workers. 
Fulton County prosecutors accuse Mr Trump's former personal attorney, Rudolph Guiliani, in the 98-page indictment of making false statements about Fulton County Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss, who worked at a vote-counting site. 
Mr Giuliani falsely claimed the two mishandled ballots in Fulton County, a reliably Democratic district in Georgia. 
Others are charged with travelling from out of state to harass Ms Freeman. 
According to the charge sheet, two defendants, Illinois pastor Stephen Lee and Kanye West's former publicist Trevian Kutti, went to Ms Freeman's home to try to convince her to confess to voter fraud. 
The unfounded allegations saw violent threats directed at Ms Freeman and Ms Moss, they testified last year to a congressional committee that blamed Mr Trump for the US Capitol riot. 
They had to go into hiding, they told lawmakers.

Shaye Moss describes threats after Trump targeting
""I've lost my name,"" Ms Freeman said, ""and I've lost my reputation. I've lost my sense of security."" 
The threats spread to Georgia's top Republican election officials, including Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and voting system implementation manager Gabriel Sterling. 
Mr Harvey, the secretary of state's elections director, said a police car had to be parked outside his house for several weeks after he received a death threat. 
The state of Georgia - where Mr Trump lost by a margin of fewer than 12,000 votes - was one of the ""bullseyes"" in efforts by the outgoing president's team to overturn the election, said Lawrence Norden, the senior director with the Brennan Center for Justice's elections and government programme.
""As a result, there's no question that election workers in those states got more of the abuse,"" he said. 
Election officials across the country have experienced an uptick in threats since 2020. 
According to a 2023 poll from the Brennan Center for Justice, 30% of local election workers said they had been abused, harassed or threatened over their jobs. 
Mr Norden has heard stories of a worker in Arizona whose dog was poisoned after the election and others who were forced to abandon their homes.  
Many are leaving the profession because of it, he said. 
""There's no question it's really been traumatic for the field and that it's impacting unfortunately who is willing to serve,"" said Mr Norden. 
This increase in threats has so far shown little sign of abating. 
Just this week, the names and addresses of grand jurors who voted in the Georgia indictment against Mr Trump were posted on a fringe website known for violent rhetoric, according to a report from nonprofit research group Advance Democracy. 
Last week, a 43-year-old woman from Texas was charged with threatening to kill Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing a federal case against Mr Trump also related to the 2020 election. 
The woman allegedly called the court in Washington DC and said: ""If Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you.""
It's yet another example of how the conspiracy theories about what happened in the last presidential election still hold a powerful grip over many in the country, Mr Norden said. 
""We're going to be living with the 2020 election - and the fallout of that - in 2024,"" he said. 
News of an indictment in Georgia against those who perpetuated election conspiracies and allegedly harassed workers have been welcomed by some. 
In a statement this week, lawyers for Ms Freeman, the Georgia poll worker, said the charges served as further evidence that ""while doing their jobs and serving their community"", Ms Freeman and her mother ""were targeted as part of a broad, co-ordinated conspiracy to undermine the results of the 2020 presidential election"". 
For others, the charges brought little relief. 
Deidre Holden, the director of elections in Paulding County, which covers part of Atlanta, faced violent threats in 2020, including an email warning of ""detonations"" at every polling site. 
Ms Holden told the BBC that 2020 ""changed the entire dynamic of how elections are viewed"".
But she argued that Mr Trump's latest charges in Georgia would only continue to ""fuel the fire of division in our country"". 
""I am truly shocked at the indictment,"" she said. ""We need to learn from the 2020 election, and move on.""
Others argued the country could not do so without more accountability. 
Some threatening violence over elections do not believe there will be consequences, said Mr Norden. 
The only way to make clear these consequences and to deter future incidents is ""to indict people, to prosecute people, and to make sure that the world sees it"", he argued. 
Mr Harvey said he has struggled watching his colleagues face incessant harassment in the aftermath of the election, during which some workers died from Covid-19 while they carried out a logistically tortuous voting process in the midst of a pandemic. 
""People have to realise that… election officials, they are people, people who are doing a good job,"" he said. 
""They shouldn't be afforded any less justice than any other victim of crime, and people do need to be held accountable.""

"Himachal Pradesh floods: More rain, less snow are turning Himalayas dangerous","Torrential rains and unabated construction are frequently triggering disasters in India's Himalayan region. 
But an unusual increase in rainfall is making the terrain even more dangerous. 
Landslides and flash floods have already killed dozens in the area this month, burying homes and buildings. Parts of Nepal and Pakistan have also suffered damage. 
A new study has found that mountains across the globe, including the Himalayas, are now seeing more rainfall at elevations where it has mostly snowed in the past.
The change has made the mountains more dangerous, scientists say, as increased temperatures not only bring rain but also accelerate melting of snow and ice. The rainwater also loosens the soil resulting in landslides, rockfalls, floods and debris-flows.
""Our findings provide several lines of evidence demonstrating a warming-induced amplification of rainfall extremes at high altitudes, specifically in snow-dominated regions of the Northern Hemisphere,"" says the study, published in June in the Nature journal.
The finding is consistent with a special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  in 2019 which said that snowfall had decreased, at least in part because of higher temperatures, especially at lower elevations of mountain regions.
There are more instances of extreme precipitation events occurring now in the form of rainfall even at a high elevation and in all seasons, says Samuel Morin, executive director of the National Centre for Meteorological Research in France and one of the authors of the special IPCC report. 
This is mainly because the zero-degree isotherm, the freezing level at which precipitation falls as snow, has moved to a higher elevation because of global warming
""As a result, these [mountain] regions are regarded as hotspots that are vulnerable to high risk of extreme rainfall events and related hazards of flooding, landslides and soil erosion,"" the study says.
This risk is higher for the Himalayan region compared with other mountainous regions like the Alps and the Rockies in the northern hemisphere, Mohamed Ombadi, the study's lead author, told the BBC. 
""That's because there are additional warming-related processes [in the Himalayas] that change wind patterns and storm tracks, leading to an increase in the intensity of storms.""
Mountains in the Himalayas, which span India, Bhutan Nepal and Pakistan, hardly have any weather stations, which often leads to a lack of accurate data on precipitation levels. 
There are a few stations located in the lower elevations of the mountains but they do not show whether the precipitation recorded is rain or snowfall. 
However, a weather station installed at the base camp of Mount Everest showed that 75% of the 245.5mm precipitation on the mountain between 1 June and 10 August this year had fallen as rain. The remaining was snow or a combination of rain and snow.
This is a huge jump from the 32% of rain recorded between June and September in 2022, 43% in 2021 and 41% in 2020.  
""We believe the dominance of rain vs snow is a relatively recent phenomenon but do not have longer term data to fully quantify that,"" said National Geographic explorers Baker Perry and Tom Matthews who were part of the National Geographic and Rolex Perpetual Planet Expeditions that installed the station.
The changes in precipitation are evident on the mountains of the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, says Bikram Singh, head of the regional weather office. 
""We can definitely say snowfall frequency has decreased and this is usually at elevations below 6,000m. During monsoon, the lower elevations receive heavy rainfall.""
The dwindling snowfall and increased rainfall mean that the nature of rivers in the region has changed, says Professor JS Rawat, former head of Kumaun University's geography department.
""There are now lots of flash floods after extreme rainfall and rivers that were once glacier-fed in the region have now turned into rain-fed [water bodies].""
Rising temperatures have added to the problem as they have accelerated the melting of Himalayan glaciers. This leads to rapid filling up of glacial lakes that then become prone to overflowing and causing floods. The thinning of glaciers also destabilises mountain slopes.
The Himalayas are estimated to be warming at three times the rate of the global average - and several studies have projected this will lead to substantive increase in rainfall there.
Locals in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh say they have noticed that the frequency and intensity of landslides and floods during the monsoon season have increased. 
""Our village Ganai was already threatened by landslides because of increased rainfall on the mountains, so we had to abandon it and move,"" says Prabhakar Bhatta, 25, a resident of Mayapur village in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district. ""But even here we have become homeless.""
On 14 August, a little before midnight, a huge flash flood hit Mr Bhatta's two-storey house, burying it under debris of rock, silt and mud.
""We managed to survive because we were warned by people in villages at higher elevations that it was raining very heavily and there could be a flash flood coming our way,"" he says. 
Mr Bhatta says his family stayed up that night and fled when they heard ""odd sounds"".
""My father built the house with his lifetime savings, and now that too is gone,"" he says. ""This region is becoming unliveable.""
Experts say that rampant development of infrastructure like road, tunnels and hydropower projects in the ecologically sensitive region also leads to these disasters. Located in a seismic zone as the Himalayas are, they are subject to earthquakes which make matters worse. 
The impact of increased rainfall is also visible across the Indian border.
In northern Pakistan, where the Himalayas meet Karakoram and Hindukush mountains, debris flows and flash floods have become increasingly common, officials say.
There were 120 flash floods in the region's Gilgit Baltistan area during the last monsoon  - a huge jump from 10-20 years ago, says Kamal Qamar, director general of the regional disaster management authority. 
""It's raining in high altitudes at around 4,000m both in summer and winter, when it should have snowed,"" he says.
In the eastern Himalayas in Nepal, flash floods and debris flows are destroying vital infrastructure like hydropower and drinking water plants, apart from local settlements, roads and bridges.
According to the country's Independent Power Producers Association, 30 hydropower plants have been damaged in eastern Nepal this monsoon.
Experts say cascading events on Himalayan regions' mountains are also becoming frequent and intense. 
That's when an event triggers something else further downstream, says Jakob Steiner, a researcher with the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, based in Kathmandu.
""And higher rainfall intensity is often the start or a sub-trigger in these chains.""

Pakistan: More than 100 arrested after churches burned,"More than 100 people have been arrested in a city in east Pakistan after thousands of Muslims burned churches and vandalised homes.
Violence in Jaranwala was sparked by claims that two Christian men had torn pages from a copy of the Quran.
The historic Salvation Army Church was still smouldering on Thursday, one day after the riot.
Ruins have been surrounded with barbed wire as the situation remains tense in the city.
Public gatherings have also been restricted for seven days in Faisalabad district, which includes Jaranwala.
The two men accused of damaging the Quran, Islam's holy book, have been arrested and are being investigated for blasphemy, which is punishable by death in Pakistan.
While some have been sentenced to death, it has never been carried out. However a mere accusation of blasphemy can result in widespread riots, sometimes leading to lynchings and killings.
A local official told BBC Urdu that authorities had received calls about protests and fires early on Wednesday morning, after reports about the desecration of the Quran circulated in the city and on social media. 
Authorities said torn pages of the sacred text with blasphemous content allegedly scribbled on them in red marker ink were found near a Christian community. 
The reports sparked outrage among the Muslim community, and the violence that ensued saw mobs attacking and looting private homes belonging to Christians. 
Police told the BBC that possessions belonging to Christians were pulled into the streets and set on fire. 
Yassir Bhatti, a 31-year-old Christian, was one of those forced to flee their homes.
""They broke the windows, doors and took out fridges, sofas, chairs and other household items to pile them up in front of the Church to be burnt,"" he told AFP news agency.
""They also burnt and desecrated Bibles, they were ruthless.""
Videos on social media show protesters destroying Christian buildings while police appear to watch on. 
A worshipper was in tears as he told the BBC: ""They burnt everything. They destroyed our homes, this house of God."" 
Another woman, called Sonam, fled with her three children just before the area was attacked.
""We just left without dressing,"" she said. ""We picked up our small children and just ran.""
Usman Anwar, the police chief in Punjab province, was asked by the BBC why - according to some eyewitness accounts - in some cases, the police did not appear to try to stop the protestors. 
He said that law enforcement did not want to escalate the tension in case it led to loss of lives.
He also confirmed the arrest of over 120 people for their involvement in the unrest. Police identified them through social media videos.
The police chief added that five cases have been filed against hundreds of people suspected of being responsible for the violence. More arrests are expected once the identification process is concluded.
Two years ago, a Sri Lankan man accused of blasphemy was killed by an enraged mob and had his body set on fire. In 2009, a group burned down about 60 homes and killed six people in the Gorja district in Punjab, after accusing them of insulting Islam.
Pakistan inherited the blasphemy law from the British in the 19th Century. In the 1980s, Islamabad introduced stiffer penalties, including the death sentence for insulting Islam.
Around 96% of Pakistan's population is Muslim. Other countries, including Iran, Brunei, and Mauritania also impose capital punishment for insulting religion. 
Religion-fuelled violence in Pakistan has risen since the country made blasphemy punishable by death, as it ""bolsters violent behaviour,"" Iftekharul Bashar, a researcher at the think-tank RSIS who focuses on political and religious violence in South Asia, told the BBC.
""The Pakistani society has experienced increased fragmentation, driven by widening economic disparities, leading to an upsurge in violence directed towards minority religious groups,"" Mr Bashar said, adding that the emergence of ""extremist and vigilante factions"" within Pakistan has also contributed to this.
Amir Mir, the information minister for Punjab province, condemned the latest alleged blasphemy and said in a statement that thousands of police had been sent to the area, with dozens of people detained. 
The angry group was mostly made up of people from an Islamist political party called Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a government source told Reuters. The TLP has denied any involvement. 
Caretaker PM Anwar ul-Haq Kakar called for swift action against those responsible for the violence.
And Pakistani bishop Azad Marshall, in the neighbouring city of Lahore, said the Christian community was ""deeply pained and distressed"" by the events.
""We cry out for justice and action from law enforcement and those who dispense justice, and the safety of all citizens to intervene immediately and assure us that our lives are valuable in our own homeland,"" he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Channel migrants: France arrests four people over fatal sinking,"Four people have been arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter in France following the fatal sinking of a migrant boat in the Channel. 
Six men died after the vessel they were aboard got into difficulty near Calais on Saturday. 
More than 50 other people were rescued by French and British coastguards.
French judges are also reportedly considering further charges against the Iraqi and Sudanese suspects.
At least two of those detained are thought to have links to human trafficking networks, according to French media. 
The people on board were reported to be mainly Afghan, with some Sudanese also present.
Karim was one of about 10 people who was turned away from boarding the vessel due to overcrowding, despite paying people smugglers €2,000 ($2,200; £1,700) for a place.
He told the BBC the smugglers promised him a ""good boat"" - something at least 10m (32ft) long - but what they were given was only 3m long.
Two of his friends were allowed aboard and Karim thinks they were among those who died. 
Another man, Idris, managed to survive the journey but has ended up back in France. 
""There were far too many passengers,"" the 22-year-old told the Reuters news agency.
""The waves were very strong, and the boat split up. 
""Half the passengers fell into the water and were swallowed up by the sea. Those who were left in the boat tried to stay alive with the help of their lifebuoys.""
Rescue workers on Saturday said it was the seventh time that week that they had pulled people from the water, raising concerns that the smugglers organising the crossings may be using a defective batch of boats.
The English Channel is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, with 600 tankers and 200 ferries passing through it every day.
Despite this, many people are willing to take the risk. 
Figures released on Thursday show more than 17,000 migrants have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel.
More than 400 people arrived in small boats on Wednesday alone.
The BBC also spoke to Zhala in Calais, who said she was fleeing gun attacks in Iraq with her young family. They have repeatedly tried to get on a boat. 
""It's fate,"" she said when asked what she thought about Saturday's sinking.
""It's not dangerous for us. We've come across so many difficulties in my country.""
A migrant from South Sudan, who has set up a camp hidden in the bushes on the coastline, told the BBC he was adamant to get to the UK to make a success of himself.
He said: ""[The UK} colonised me in Sudan, that's why. It's like my father.""
Explaining why he wants to leave Sudan, he explained he was leaving because of war and corruption.
But French authorities have threatened to move him and his fellow countryman from their makeshift camp, he added.  
Karim said he is also still looking to try and make it across into the UK.
Aid workers in Calais say more migrants have been arriving in recent weeks and have been living rough on the coastline. They say many of them are determined to get to the UK, despite warnings over the dangers of the crossing.

RTÉ has no plans for Tubridy return 'for now',"At a glance
The former Late Late Show host has been off-air since 22 June
Ryan Tubridy received €345,000 more than was declared publicly by the Republic of Ireland's national broadcaster
The announcement about Mr Tubridy's future at RTÉ was announced to staff in an email by the director general
Kevin Bakhurst concluded his email by saying ""who knows what the future holds""
There are no plans for Ryan Tubridy to return to RTÉ presenting ""for now"", the Irish state broadcaster's director general has said. 
Mr Tubridy has been off-air since 22 June, when controversy over the under-declaration of his salary was first revealed by the RTÉ board.
An audit of RTÉ's finances found Mr Tubridy was paid €345,000 (£296,800) more than was declared publicly between 2017 and 2022.
Some of the undisclosed payments to Mr Tubridy from RTÉ were made through a UK-based ""barter account"" operated by the organisation, but there is confusion over how exactly that was done.
RTÉ is funded using advertising revenue as well as a TV licence fee.
In an email to staff, director general Kevin Bakhurst said that negotiations with Mr Tubridy were entered into with good faith ""in the hopes of reaching an agreement that would see Ryan return to his RTÉ Radio 1 show"".
Mr Bakhurst said: ""I have decided not to continue with negotiations and, as such, there are no plans for Ryan to return to his presenting role with RTÉ at this time.
""Despite having agreed some of the fundamentals, including fee, duration and hours, regretfully, it is my view that trust between the parties has broken down.""
Mr Bakhurst concluded his email by saying ""who knows what the future holds"".
However, he added that ""for now"" he is concluding negotiations with Mr Tubridy.
RTÉ's board on Wednesday acknowledged governance “failures” over Mr Tubridy’s pay as it released a long-awaited report by accountants Grant Thornton.
In a statement on Wednesday, the former Late Late Show host welcomed the latest report.
The report found a plausible explanation for the under-declaration of Mr Tubridy's earnings in 2017, 2018 and 2019 by €120,000 was RTÉ's objective to achieve a position where his earnings for each year were below €500,000.
It also stated that Mr Tubridy had no involvement in the adjustments made by the broadcaster in 2020 to his published earnings for the 2017 to 2019 period.
Meanwhile, the chair of an Irish parliament committee has confirmed that members will meet in a private session next Tuesday to discuss the payments controversy at RTÉ.

Ukrainian twins' A-level success at Harrogate college,"Twin sisters from Ukraine have achieved top A-level grades at a Yorkshire college despite fearing for their family's safety back home.
Diana and Sofiia Shypovych managed a combined five grade A*s and one grade A at Harrogate Ladies' College.
The teenagers, who are from Cherkasy, joined the college in September 2021 as boarding pupils, leaving behind their parents in Ukraine.
They said they were ""delighted"" at their A-level success.
Russia invaded Ukraine just a few months after the sisters joined the school, aged 16.
""It was difficult being away from my family, but school really helped me,"" Sofiia said.
Diana, who alongside her sister helped to raise funds for those affected by the war, said she was delighted with her results. 
However, she told the BBC it had been ""really difficult"" at times, especially when she was not in lessons and had time to read the news and think about her friends and family back home.
But, despite everything that had happened in Ukraine, she said school had given both her and her sister a lot of confidence.
The sisters, who chose to return to Ukraine after graduating from the Harrogate school earlier in the summer, celebrated their results alongside their family. 
Their mother, Iana Shypovych, said she was thrilled.
""When our then 16-year old daughters left Ukraine to study in Harrogate we were a little worried about how they would adapt to living so far away from home, but our concerns never came true. 
""When the war broke out, we were truly grateful they were safe and being cared for,"" she added.
Harrogate Ladies' College principal Sylvia Brett paid tribute to the sisters.
""We're incredibly proud of all of our pupils, but Sofiia and Diana deserve special recognition for the circumstances under which they've been studying for the last two years,"" she said.
""They are truly remarkable young women who always looked out for others in school and organised events such as the Ukraine Cultural Day to help us all understand and support their country.""
Diana and Sofiia said they now both hoped to study psychology at university.

Pascale Ferrier jailed for 22 years for mailing Donald Trump ricin,"A Canadian woman has been jailed for 22 years in the US for sending letters laced with ricin poison, including to Donald Trump when he was president. 
Pascale Ferrier, 56, agreed to the sentence in January after pleading guilty to biological weapons charges.
The deadly envelope addressed to Mr Trump was intercepted in September 2020 before delivery to the White House.
Ferrier told the court that she regretted that her plan had failed and that she ""couldn't stop Trump"".
In a long-winded address to the court, she also said that she saw herself as an activist not a terrorist.
""I want to find peaceful means to achieve my goals,"" Ferrier added.
The FBI found her fingerprints on the letter to Mr Trump, which urged him to drop out of the presidential race. 
""I found a new name for you: 'The Ugly Tyrant Clown',"" she wrote in the letter, according to FBI charging documents. 
District Judge Dabney Friedrich sentenced Ferrier to 262 months  - just shy of 22 years - in prison. She will be deported from the US after serving her sentence and faces supervision for life if she ever returns.
Judge Friedrich told Ferrier her actions were ""potentially deadly"" and ""harmful to you, harmful to society, harmful to the potential victims"".
Ferrier also admitted sending similarly tainted letters to eight Texas law enforcement officials.
In 2019, she was detained in the state for about 10 weeks for unlawfully carrying a weapon and driving without a valid licence, and she blamed those officials for that detention, according to a US justice department statement.
Ferrier, a dual citizen of France and Canada, was arrested crossing the border into Buffalo, New York in September 2020. She was carrying a gun, knife and rounds of ammunition. 
She later admitted to making the ricin - a poison made from the waste material left over from castor beans processing - at her Quebec home, and placing it into an envelope with the letter.
There is no known antidote to ricin. Depending on the dose, it can cause death within 36 to 72 hours, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
In 2014, a Mississippi man was sentenced to 25 years in prison after sending ricin laced letters to President Barack Obama and other officials.

Sara Sharif: More tests needed to establish cause of death,"Further tests are needed to establish the cause of death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, police have said.
Sara's body was found at her family home in Woking, Surrey, at about 02:50 BST on 10 August.
A post-mortem examination performed on Tuesday concluded that the cause was ""still to be established"".
Three people known to Sara booked one-way tickets to Pakistan, and flew the day before her body was found, BBC News understands.
Surrey Police launched a murder investigation after Sara's body was found alone in the property in Hammond Road, and officers plan to be there for ""some weeks"".
No arrests have been made, but the three people detectives wish to speak to are believed to have left the country on 9 August.
A travel agent in Woking told the BBC that he was contacted by someone known to Sara, wanting tickets for three adults and five children.
On Thursday, flowers were left outside the house, including a bouquet with a card written in Polish that appeared to be from Sara's mother. 
The message translated as: ""Sleep sweetly my darling daughter. You are an angel in heaven now and watching over us from above. Love you, Mama."" 
Det Supt Mark Chapman, of the Surrey Police and Sussex Police major crime team, said officers are not looking to identify anyone else in connection with the investigation.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) has also revealed it is working with Surrey Police in their investigation.
A statement from the NCA said: ""The NCA is supporting Surrey Police with their investigations into the murder of a 10 year old girl.
""This involves specialist officers from our Joint International Crime Centre and across our international network providing operational support, advice and guidance as required.""
The BBC has spoken to police in Pakistan who have said that no formal approach has been made by the British authorities over the case.
Pakistan and the UK do not have a formal extradition treaty.
Surrey Police said the girl's mother was informed and continues to be supported by specially trained officers.

Ukrainian refugee in Newbury 'proud' to pass A-levels,"A teenager who fled his home in Ukraine has passed his A-levels a year early. 
Andrii came to the UK with his mother and sister in June 2022, aged 16, and stayed with a family in Newbury.
He attended Trinity School and jumped a year to complete A-levels in maths, computer science and business studies in English - his third language. 
Andrii is celebrating with his father back in Ukraine before he turns 18, as he will not be able to leave if he visits again after his birthday.
His father has been fighting in the war and it is the first time since fleeing their home that Andrii, his mother and sister have seen him. 
They left Chernihiv, close to the Belarussian border, and stayed with an acquaintance in central Ukraine for 10 weeks as they waited for permits to be able to enter the UK. 
They then moved in with Gillian Durrant and her husband Stuart, who live in Newbury, where they have lived for the past 14 months.
Andrii said studying for his exams felt like ""a sense of relief"" because it helped him feel ""less stressed"" not thinking about the war. 
He explained: ""I wasn't thinking about all the horrible things that are happening in Ukraine. I don't think it's really a good feeling to just think every day, hour, minute about the war.""
Andrii said he was ""really grateful"" to Mrs Durrant, adding: ""I can't tell you how many things Gillian has done for us."" 
Mrs Durrant said Andrii worked ""incredibly hard"" and had completed a two-year course in one year so he could complete his A-levels this summer. 
Andrii received an A in maths, B in computer science and a B in business studies and is now considering going to university in England.
Ukrainian military law states applicants of higher education studying full-time are exempt from signing up for national service, which is why Andrii expects this to be his last trip to his home country for some time, unless he starts university. 
He said: ""I do feel proud, two years ago I didn't really think I would have such an opportunity to attend any university and I'm really grateful.""

Cape Verde boat disaster: 'My brother died for a dream we all have',"The brother of a man who died after a boat carrying dozens of migrants was found off Cape Verde has told the BBC they were trying to reach Spain.
More than 60 people are feared to have died on the boat, which was at sea for over a month. Most were from Senegal.
""Everyone is shocked. He was one of the pillars of our family,"" Mamour Ba said about his brother Cheikhouna.
But the 27-year-old said he would still attempt the trip himself as it was impossible to make a living in Senegal.
Mr Ba, 27, is a student from the small fishing town of Fass Boye, halfway along the coast between the capital, Dakar, and the historical town of St Louis. 
Three of his brothers and one of his cousins were on the wooden pirogue style boat that set off for Europe on 10 July from Fass Boye with 101 people on board.
""They wanted to get to Spain. They said they wanted to leave and I couldn't tell them not to because they'd already made their minds up.""
He thought they had all died, until he got a call from Cape Verde on Wednesday after their rescue.
They were among 38 people, including children, who were saved, with footage showing them being helped ashore, some on stretchers, on the island of Sal. More than 60 other people are feared to be lost at sea.
The archipelago sits around 600km (372 miles) off the coast of West Africa and on the migration route to the Canary Islands, a Spanish territory seen by many as a route to the EU.
Mr Ba says he still does not know the details of his relatives' five-week journey as they were too disorientated: ""They didn't have the strength to explain what happened, they just said: 'We're alive'. They sounded very weak.""
But as the conversation continued, he found out that not all of them had survived.
""One of my brothers, Ibrahima, used one of the doctor's phones to call me from Cape Verde.
""He told us our other brother Cheikhouna was lost at sea. I was shocked. We were very close, he was a real fighter. He was married with two kids. 
""The day he left he held my hands and said, 'Brother I have to go.'
""He was my brother, he was my friend.""
After news of the tragedy spread in Fass Boye, where most of those on board the boat hailed from, anger erupted on Wednesday.
Some set fire to the house of the mayor, angered with the authorities about the lack of opportunities for young people.
This frustration is something Mr Ba is all too familiar with - he has tried at least twice to leave Senegal. 
""There was nothing for me here... so I decided I needed to try to move to Europe via Morocco,"" he said, speaking of his first attempt during his third year at university.
Things did not work out though, and he was forced to return home after spending nine months there. 
But he was determined to achieve his dream of moving to Europe - and tried again, this time just a few weeks ago, at the end of June, with Cheikhouna. 
But the attempt failed.
""This latest trip was Cheikhouna's second attempt at getting to Europe by boat. Three days after we came back, he had set off again,"" Mr Ba said.
""He was determined to leave because he had a family and there's nothing for us here in Senegal.
""We're fishermen, we work all day and we make no money. He just wanted to feed his family and have a better life.""
Mr Ba knows it is risky to try to board another boat to Europe, but it comes down to finances.
""I don't have the money to take a plane. It's better to pay 300,000 CFA ($480, £375) or 400,000 CFA to go to Spain than to spend millions trying to get there by plane.""
He says he is not scared of drowning.
""Others have done this journey and have drowned but it doesn't put me off. It's a risk I'm willing to take. Even if there was a boat ready to go today, I'd take it.""

Belarus declares 19th Century nationalist poems 'extremist',"Two Belarusian poems from the 19th Century have been declared ""extremist"", in a sign of an expanding crackdown on criticism of the authorities.
Vincent Dunin-Martsinkevich's poems relate to a nationalist uprising against the Russian Empire.
Authoritarian Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko has tightened his grip on power since elections in 2020 which were widely considered to be rigged.
He has since provided support for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine.
Experts described the banning of the poems as part of a transition to totalitarianism, as many opponents of the regime are nationalists who dislike Mr Lukashenko's pro-Russian stance.
Most have now fled the country or are in jail.
An announcement by the prosecutor's office in the capital Minsk on Thursday said that the two poems, The Winds are Floating and Conversation of an Elderly Man, along with a foreword to the author's collected works by literary critic Yazep Yanushkevich, had been declared ""extremist material"".
The poems were written during the Kastus Kalinowski rebellion of 1863 by Belarusians and Poles in what was then Poland and a part of the Russian Empire.
Dunin-Martsinkevich was at the time accused of disseminating ideas ""harmful for the authorities"".
He was arrested and incarcerated, but his direct participation in the uprising was never proven.
Today his works are part of the school curriculum and his plays are performed regularly. He has several streets named after him and he is celebrated in his home town of Bobruisk, in the south-east of Belarus.
The independent outlet Nexta said that books by several 20th Century authors - Larisa Geniyush, Vladimir Neklyayev, Lidiya Arobey and Natalya Arseneva - had also been banned.

Spain's Queen Letizia to attend World Cup final against England,"Spain's Queen Letizia will fly to Australia to attend Sunday's World Cup final in Sydney but no British royals will be present.
England's Lionesses take on Spain in what is both teams' first final in the women's event.
Football Association President Prince William will cheer on the England team from the UK, Kensington Palace said.
It is understood he made the decision to avoid making long-distance flights for a very short stay in Australia.
The prince has made tackling climate change one of his priorities and is believed to be concerned about the impact of such a journey.
However, the Royal Spanish Football Federation confirmed that Queen Letizia and her 16-year-old daughter Infanta Sofia would go to the final.
King Felipe is busy with other official duties and will not be joining them, it said in a statement.
The federation added that the queen visited the team during training in June and gave a speech to players and coaching staff.
Prince William also visited the Lionesses in training, handing manager Sarina Wiegman an honorary CBE - Commander of the Order of the British Empire. 
He is expected to watch the final on TV.
""What a phenomenal performance from the Lionesses - on to the final!"" the prince wrote following their semi-final victory against Australia.
King Charles also congratulated the team, writing to Wiegman and the players: ""My wife and I join all our family in sending the mighty Lionesses our warmest congratulations on reaching the final of the World Cup, and in sharing our very best wishes for Sunday's match.""
England's women are European champions, and were given their medals by Prince William after last year's final at Wembley.
England's only other football World Cup final, also at Wembley in 1966, was attended by Queen Elizabeth II, who presented captain Bobby Moore with the trophy after the team's 4-2 victory over West Germany.

Warwickshire refugee pays tribute to community support,"A refugee who fled Syria has spoken of the support from the local community after resettling in Warwickshire.
Since arriving with his family in June 2022, Abdulrahman Zakaria said local residents had helped arrange schooling and healthcare, as well as supporting him to set up his own IT business.
He said they had also helped him and his family improve their English.
""They make the hard things easier,"" he said, adding that his neighbours had also been ""very friendly"".
""Here when we came, we feel like we are very safe,"" he added.
Across the UK, more than 1,000 refugees have been supported by community sponsorship, which involves local groups directly helping people to resettle.
Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said the scheme, which opened in 2016, had offered the ""best prospect"" of integration. 
He said the UK was one of a ""few countries"" that allowed local communities to help settle those ""directly at risk in conflict zones"" around the world.
Mr Zakaria had spent the previous 10 years living in Egypt while waiting for resettlement in the UK, having been referred by the UN Refugee Agency.
He described how the family had escaped from the war in Syria to find a ""good life"".
Under the Home office scheme, eligible refugees are assessed for their need for resettlement, before being matched with sponsor groups.
Community groups are also asked to raise £9,000 to support resettlement and integration needs.
Julia Fitzsimons and other members of community group Warwickshire Circle of Friends have been supporting Mr Zakaria since his arrival.
""We found the house and provided the furnishing for that,"" she said.
""We can link them with the school, we've helped them to work out how to go to the doctors, the shops - so we are friends here, but also good neighbours.""

Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman invited to visit UK,"Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been invited to visit the UK, the Saudi Arabian embassy has told the BBC.
No 10 said it would confirm the prime minister's engagements in the usual way, with nothing in the diary yet.
A spokesperson said the prime minister looked forward to meeting the crown prince ""at the earliest opportunity"". 
It would be the prince's first UK visit since the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018.
The invitation was first reported by the Financial Times and the Times newspapers.
The murder of Mr Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Arabia's government, was condemned by the West at the time. 
UK ministers said it involved ""appalling brutality"" and later sanctioned 20 Saudi nationals involved in the killing.
US intelligence agencies concluded that the prince must have authorised the killing, despite him denying any involvement. 
A Downing Street spokesperson said Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to the crown prince earlier, with the leaders discussing their commitment to developing the trade and investment relationship between the two countries, as well as to strengthening cooperation on defence and security.
The BBC has been told the Saudis were already making plans for a visit at least a month ago. 
It is not clear whether the prince has formally accepted the invitation yet but it is known that he does want to come to the UK. 
Dates currently being considered are in the first half of October.
The invitation was criticised by the Liberal Democrats, who said it sent a signal that the crown prince ""can continue acting with impunity and we and our allies will do nothing about it"". 
The party's foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran said: ""It beggars belief that Rishi Sunak is rolling out the carpet for Mohammed bin Salman. 
""This man - who authorised the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi and presides over a dismal human rights record - should not be receiving a warm welcome from the UK government.""
Polly Truscott, from human rights campaign group Amnesty International, said: ""There must be no question of the UK rolling out the red carpet for Mohammed bin Salman or of the Saudi ruler being able to use this visit to rehabilitate himself on the world stage.""
However, Labour said the UK also had to have a ""dialogue"" with Saudi Arabia.
The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""It's important as part of that visit that the prime minister speaks to him about human rights.""
She added: ""Part of our role internationally is to challenge other nations… and to try and influence in that way. If you don't then you don't have any influence whatsoever.""
UK ministers have indicated a desire for closer ties with the kingdom in recent months. The nation has opened an office in London for its trillion pound investment fund to diversity its economy away from oil. 
Saudi Arabia has also spent billions of pounds through its Public Investment Fund on international sports deals, including a takeover of Premier League club Newcastle United and the negotiation of a dominant stake in professional golf. 
Critics have described this as an attempt to ""sportswash"" - or distract from - the country's human rights record. 
Earlier this year, when he was business secretary, Grant Shapps held talks with Saudi Arabia over collaborating more in sectors like space, tech, and critical minerals. 
The government has also been exploring support for a trade deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), of which Saudi Arabia is a key member.
While they have not been involved in the crown prince's invitation, a Department for Business and Trade source said securing a trade deal with the GCC was a ""priority"" for Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch. 
The GCC is headquartered in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, where Ms Badenoch visited earlier this summer. 
The source added a deal would provide ""enormous opportunities to bring investment into the UK"" but said talks were separate to those about a visit by the prince. 
They said the government view was that ""when it comes to trade deals and relationships you are in a stronger position to talk about what they are doing if working with them not lecturing from the outside"". 
Then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson met the crown prince in Riyadh last year, as part of talks with Gulf leaders about ending reliance on Russian oil and gas. 
However, he turned down an invite to the Queen's funeral in September, with another senior Saudi royal attending in his place.
He last visited the UK in March 2018, when Theresa May was prime minister, six months before the murder of Mr Khashoggi.
The prince, who is the de facto ruler of the world's leading oil exporter, won plaudits from Western leaders for overseeing some reforms in the conservative Gulf kingdom, including lifting the ban on women driving. 
However, his international reputation was severely damaged by the killing of Mr Khashoggi.

Magaluf: six arrested over alleged gang rape of British teen,"Spanish police are investigating the alleged gang rape of an 18-year-old British woman on the island of Majorca.
The alleged incident is said to have happened early on Monday at a hotel in the popular holiday resort town of Magaluf. 
Five French tourists and a Swiss tourist have been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and violation of the right to privacy.
They are in custody and their phones have been seized.
The alleged victim is thought to have met a group of young tourists in the early hours of Monday morning.
She is believed to have followed them to their hotel, where she was forced to have sexual intercourse and was filmed by her alleged aggressors.
The woman later escaped and was helped by hotel staff after being found calling for help on the street.
It is the second case of suspected gang rape in Majorca in recent months. A group of German tourists was arrested in July on suspicion of sexually assaulting a woman.
Majorca has become a popular destination for young tourists due to its reputation for cheap alcohol and beach parties.
However, the authorities there have long said they want to clean up the area to make it more attractive to more upmarket travellers and families.

Gotthard: World's longest rail tunnel shut for months after freight crash,"The world's longest rail tunnel has been shut to passenger services after a derailment in Switzerland caused damage that will take months to repair.
Swiss authorities said there was ""no indication"" when the Gotthard Base Tunnel would reopen.
Sixteen wagons derailed and are still stuck inside, a week after the incident on 10 August.
Opened in 2016, the Gotthard rail link took 20 years to build and cost more than $12bn (£8.2bn).
National Swiss rail operator SBB chief executive Vincent Ducrot said on Wednesday that Gotthard was one of the safest tunnels in the world.
""The fact that an accident like this could happen has hit us very hard,"" he said. ""Fortunately, there were no injuries, though significant material damage was incurred.""
An investigation is being led by the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board (STSB) and the public prosecutor's office of the Canton of Ticino.
SBB said that in total, around 8km (4.9 miles) of track and 20,000 concrete sleepers needed to be replaced.
The rail operator added that one side of the tunnel was unaffected and should be operating ""in principle"" for freight usage from 23 August, but passenger trains would not be able to use the unaffected side due to safety reasons.
In a statement SBB said: ""Since the derailment, the tunnel has been closed to passenger and freight traffic, and trains must be diverted. 
""Currently, there is no indication of how long the tunnel will be closed.
""Diverting trains via the panorama route means longer journey times for passengers.""
The route cuts through the Alps and provides a high-speed link between northern and southern Europe.
As well as transporting passengers, Gotthard is a key passage for cargo - particularly between Germany and Italy.
More than two-thirds of rail freight traffic in the Alps rolled through the tunnel last year.
Journey times will now take at least 60 minutes longer and passengers travelling internationally will need to change trains in Chiasso. 
Only trains travelling to and from Genoa and Venice will run directly, SBB said.

More than 60 migrants feared dead at sea off Cape Verde coast,"This video can not be played
Watch: Survivors brought ashore after migrant boat disaster
More than 60 people are feared dead after a boat carrying migrants was found off Cape Verde in West Africa. 
Thirty-eight people, including children, were rescued, with footage showing them being helped ashore, some on stretchers, on the island of Sal.
Almost all those on board the boat, which was at sea for over a month, are thought to have been from Senegal.
Cape Verde officials have called for global action on migration to help prevent further loss of life. 
The vessel was first spotted on Monday, police told the AFP news agency. Initial reports suggested that the boat had sunk but it was later clarified that it had been found drifting.
The wooden pirogue style boat was seen almost 320km (200 miles) off Sal, a part of Cape Verde, by a Spanish fishing boat, which then alerted authorities, police said.
The survivors include four children aged between 12 and 16, a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.
The boat left the Senegalese fishing village of Fass Boye on 10 July with 101 people on board, Senegal's foreign ministry said on Tuesday, citing survivors. 
Moda Samb, an elected official in the village, told AFP news agency nearly all those on the boat had grown up in the community and that some local families were still waiting to hear whether their relatives were among the survivors. 
The ministry said it was liaising with authorities in Cape Verde to arrange the repatriation of Senegalese nationals.
The passengers' other countries of origin reportedly include Sierra Leone and, in one case, Guinea-Bissau.
By Nicolas Négoce, BBC News, Dakar
People in the small fishing community of Fass Boye are in shock - and there is a lot of anger too.
University student Moussa Diop, who lives here, told me he had three male cousins and a teenage nephew on the boat that left in secret last month. His sister had no idea her son was on the boat - and had been in a desperate state since his disappearance last month.
The first the family heard about their doomed voyage was when one of the cousins sent Mr Diop a WhatsApp video from Sal on Wednesday to tell them that three of them had made it and were in hospital - but one of the young cousins had died.
Mr Diop says sorrow for lost relatives and relief about those who have survived has boiled over into frustration. After news of the tragedy spread on Wednesday, people in the town began damaging cars and boats and they also set fire to the house of the mayor.
Young people blame a lack of opportunities and want the authorities to do more to help them.
Jose Moreira, a health official on Sal, said the survivors were improving and were being looked after, with a focus on rehydration and tests for conditions like malaria. 
Health Minister Filomena Goncalves said: ""We know that migration issues are global issues, which require international co-operation, a lot of discussion and global strategy. 
""We all - all the nations - have to sit down at the table and see what we can do so that we don't lose any more lives at sea, above all.""
IOM spokeswoman Safa Msehli said safe pathways for migration were ""sorely lacking"" and that their absence gave ""room to smugglers and traffickers to put people on these deadly journeys"".
The survivors may have ended up in Cape Verde, but it was almost certainly not their intended destination. 
The archipelago sits around 600km off the coast of West Africa and on the migration route to the Canary Islands, a Spanish territory seen by many as a route to the EU. According to the IOM, it is one of the most dangerous journeys any migrant can make. 
""This devastating loss of life demonstrates the continued failure of the Europe's hostile approach to refugee protection,"" Natasha Tsangarides, Associate Director of Advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said.
As ever with irregular migration, exact figures are hard to come by, but between 2020 and 2023 at least 67,000 people arrived in the Canary Islands. 
Over that same period, just over 2,500 lost their lives. The IOM point out that figure covers the deaths that have been registered. Given the irregular and secretive nature of the route, the true figure could be far higher.
So, what is driving people to leave their homes and risk such a dangerous journey? In many cases, poverty is thought to be a key factor. Europe is seen by many as a route to a better life for the person migrating, as well as remittances to support the families they leave behind. 
There are, however, other factors at play as well. Much of West Africa is increasingly unstable, with coups and Islamist insurgencies making an already difficult situation worse. 
In Senegal, opposition politicians have been imprisoned, with claims of violent crackdowns by the authorities. President Macky Sall recently announced he would not seek a third term in office, but tensions remain high.

"Looting, barricades, bodies - volunteers rush to help Lahaina after fire","When deadly fires torched the Hawaiian town of Lahaina, improvised groups of volunteers raced to respond. In convoys of trucks, they delivered supplies and were some of the first to witness the devastation in the place many of them called home.
Along an industrial road in Kahului, not far from Maui's northern shore, Auntie Lehua Kekahuna sat in the back office of a nondescript single storey building. A handful of men stood around her - tall and broad, half wore bright yellow construction vests, with dirt caked on their faces and under their nails. When Kekahuna spoke, they stayed quiet. 
It was Tuesday, one week after a fast-moving fire tore through Lahaina, levelling most of the historic town and killing more than 100. In the last few days, efforts from local, state and federal agencies have come into focus - with hundreds of emergency personnel deployed and $2.3m (£1.81m) in assistance to families disbursed so far. 
But in the immediate aftermath of the fires, before official forces had mobilised, Kekahuna already had. She and her friend, Duke Sparks, devised their own response within hours. Sparks shut down his central Maui restaurant, calling in staff to make hot meals for shelters and emergency responders, and the two collected donations for evacuees. And - within a day - they had organised an impromptu team of truck drivers to transport that aid to Lahaina, moving in and out of the devastated town more than a dozen times even when official routes were closed. 
""Auntie says it all the time, when the kāhea comes, we'll be there,"" said Koa Gomes, a nephew of Kekahuna, using the Hawaiian word for 'call'. ""We're our own soldiers."" 
Their efforts are part of a wider network of support run by locals outside the formal channels of government agencies and NGOs. According to dozens of people here, that grassroots aid has been crucial in the face of governmental bureaucracy and delays. 
""Honestly we don't disrespect our government,"" Kekahuna said. ""But we're not waiting.""
The group's headquarters are now at Shaka Detailing, an auto detailing company owned by Kekahuna's son, Sonny, that is around 25 miles from Lahaina. The short hallway to Kekahuna's office was lined with donations, neatly ordered piles of nappies, food, water and batteries. 
Kekahuna's authority was clear, her low voice silencing entire rooms. ""She's our auntie, she's a mother, she's a grandmother,"" Gomes said. ""When she speaks we keep our mouths shut."" 
Passing through the small building was an assortment of drivers, most stopping on their way to or from Lahaina. For days they have filled their trucks, owned or borrowed, before setting off to the frontlines and using connections with local police to pass through checkpoints designed to keep non-official personnel away. 
Most of these men are from Lahaina, meaning that some of the first to see the town after it was destroyed were those who call it home.
""It's survival, everyone's in survival mode,"" said Casey Smythe, from Lahaina, who drove in the first convoy to West Maui. ""You're in disbelief. How could this happen?"". During his first trip in, he said, he cried the entire time.

Some supplies are deposited at makeshift hubs, dubbed Kanaka [Hawaiian] Costcos. Others are delivered door to door, to the few homes still standing. 
""Before FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] and Red Cross was there, don't take it in the wrong way, but Kanaka Costco was there,"" Smythe said. ""We were there."" 
""Lahaina itself, it looks like hell,"" said Eddie Iniba in Kekahuna's office, stopping in after an overnight shift in the levelled town, with mud and sweat streaking his shirt. Streetlights in Lahaina were still down, he said, and the only visible sights at night were of police barricades and military personnel. 
""It's like watching an apocalypse movie,"" he said. ""It hurts."" 
Iniba and several others spoke of a different kind of horror inside Lahaina - the looting of both vacant homes and of the bodies of the dead. 
One man, Chaymen Enomoto, said he was forced to stop a friend from assaulting someone who they found pillaging in Lahaina. 
""He found someone looting the body of an elderly woman who was charred up. She had gold and jewellery everywhere."" His friend ""broke"" at the sight, Enomoto said, and used a knife to attack the looter. 
""It took every ounce of me to stop him from killing this guy, because I felt the same anger he was going through."" 
Officials have denied claims of violence or looting in Lahaina. At a press conference last week, Hawaii's Governor Josh Green said there had been ""virtually no conflicts between the residents of Maui that have survived"".
Asked about these comments, Enomoto replied: ""We're catching it before they get there."" 
FEMA, the behemoth federal agency tasked with handling natural disasters, has provided $2.3m in assistance to more than 1,300 households so far and sent more than 190 search and rescue team members as well as hundreds more of its own personnel. The agency has urged survivors to register online to receive housing and other assistance - including an immediate payment of $700 for food and water - but with limited power in West Maui, this aid remains out of reach for some.
The agency cannot offer direct assistance for a recovery operation until a state requests a disaster declaration from the president. In Hawaii, this did not come until Thursday - two days after the fires began. 
Taken together, the accounts from Lahaina suggest improvised volunteer groups have acted as a substitute for aid workers, demolition crews and law enforcement. And while neither Kekahuna or Sparks criticised the government explicitly, their story reflects a common sentiment in Maui - that locals have stepped in to fill the void of a slow official response. 
""All those Red Cross people, bless their hearts, flying in from out of state,"" Kekahuna said. ""Do you think they're going to pick up the bodies? You think they can pick up metal? You think they can pick up cars?"" 
She continued: ""Our locals are going to be the people to clean up this mess."" 
Some West Maui residents have said they received more help from unofficial supply chains than from government channels. Inside Shaka Detailing this week, a man dropping off donations said of the volunteer group: ""They're the only ones doing anything."" 
And the alienation between locals and their government has deepened due to a widespread belief that the precise scale of destruction has been downplayed. On Tuesday, Hawaii's governor said he expects the death toll to grow significantly, suggesting it may double as the search progresses. 
""We live by the forensic facility,"" said Gomes, Kekahuna's nephew. ""There are four reefers [refrigerated trucks]. One container, easy, 100 bodies in there. They don't even have enough body bags."" 
And from that same view, Gomes has watched families be called in to identify the remains. ""All you can hear is crying, screaming, wailing,"" Gomes said. ""But we can't call on anybody, we get nothing.""

World Cup: Matildas score TV rating record in semi-final loss to England,"The Matildas' semi-final defeat to England in the Women's World Cup has become the most watched television show in Australia on record.
The game drew 11.15 million viewers at its peak on Wednesday as football fever gripped the host nation.
Host broadcaster Channel Seven said an average audience of 7.13 million tuned in for the Sydney match.
""The Matildas have rewritten the history books,"" said Seven's head of network sport Lewis Martin. 
The semi-final, which the Lionesses won 3-1, commanded the highest viewership ever recorded since the current rating system was established in 2001.
Some 975,000 viewers watched the match on 7plus, which the network said was record viewership for a streaming event in Australia.
It added the final figure will likely be higher as the audience data, which is measured by research firm OzTAM, does not include people watching from pubs, live sites and stadiums.
The data also does not include those who watched on pay-TV broadcaster Optus Sport.
Mr Martin said Australia was ""captivated"" and the Matildas had ""captured the hearts and minds of the nation"".
""Seven is beyond proud to have played a part in bringing Australia together around our screens, as the Matildas' performance captured the Australian spirit like nothing we have seen in decades,"" he said.
It was the second time in less than a week that television records were broken in the country, which has a population of 25 million.
On Sunday, Australia's win over France after a thrilling penalty shootout had a peak audience of 7.2 million on Channel Seven.
The figures surpassed other major sporting events such as the Rugby World Cup final in 2003.
More than 8 million people are reported to have tuned in to watch Cathy Freeman's 400m final at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, which predates the current ratings system.
Australian fans will have one more chance to support the Matildas in the World Cup for their third-place play-off against Sweden in Brisbane on Saturday.
England face Spain in the final in Sydney on Sunday.

North Korea: Taekwondo athletes believed headed to Kazakhstan,"A group of people, thought to be North Korean Taekwondo athletes, have crossed the border into China.
They are said to be heading to the Taekwondo world championships in neighbouring Kazakhstan. 
It marks the first time that Pyongyang has sent a sports team overseas since its Covid border closure in 2020.
Sources say they will travel on to Beijing before heading to the Kazakh capital Astana.
Two green buses have been spotted crossing the Yalu River that divides North Korea and China. They arrived in the Chinese city of Dandong, where dozens of people then disembarked. 
At the start of the pandemic in 2020, Pyongyang sealed off its borders, with no one allowed to leave or enter the country since. 
These are the first known athletes to be sent overseas, which indicates that Pyongyang may be finally relaxing its border restrictions. 
Recent reports also suggest that the government is preparing to allow its own citizens to re-enter the country soon. North Korean labourers, who number in the tens of thousands, are still in China and Russia.
Last month, Russian and Chinese delegations were in Pyongyang to mark the 70th anniversary of the Korean War armistice.
They were the first known foreign groups to be invited to the country since borders closed three years ago.

Radioactive material found as Australian border force raid Sydney home,"Three people have been taken to hospital after radioactive material was found inside a home in southern Sydney.
For several hours the home in Arncliffe was cordoned off with tape warning of a toxic, nuclear or biological hazard inside.
Australian Border Force (ABF) confirmed officials had carried out an operation with the assistance of fire crews.
Fire and Rescue New South Wales said ""low level radioactive isotopes"" had been found.
The material was discovered in a suitable and effective container with no release of radiation, the brigade added in a statement.
""They were able to further seal the material without incident. Three occupants of the address were taken to hospital, purely for observation,"" it said.
Nearby residents were evacuated as a precaution and have since returned to their homes on Kelsey Street.
Additional testing by the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) confirmed no evidence of exposure.
Earlier, local broadcaster Channel 10 had reported mercury and a uranium isotope were discovered. This detail was not confirmed by the ABF nor the fire service.
Photos from the scene showed the small brown-brick apartment building cut off from the road by red and yellow tape saying: ""Contaminated area - do not enter - hot zone"".
Sam Abraham, 19, was trying to get home when he came across the closed road.
He told the AFP News Agency: ""It's scary finding uranium in your neighbour's house. It's not something that usually happens in Arncliffe.""
Nemr Khamis, 60, added: ""In the morning I heard the loud trucks and all that stuff, I looked out of the window and I saw the ambulance and the fire brigade.
""I had a baby with me and the police told me to go inside.""
Khamis phoned relatives who told him ""there's some uranium in the street just off the unit"", he added.
Part of Australia's department of home affairs, the AFB is responsible for offshore and onshore border enforcement, investigations, compliance, detention operations as well as customs services in the country.

Pakistan: Mob burns churches over blasphemy claims,"Thousands of Muslims in a city in Pakistan have set fire to at least four churches and vandalised the homes of Christians over claims that two men desecrated the Quran, police say.
Residents said up to a dozen buildings connected to churches in Jaranwala, in eastern Punjab, were also damaged. 
Police have detained more than 100 protestors and launched an investigation into the violence.
Authorities say the situation remains tense, but say no deaths were reported.
Police have also filed a case against two local Christian residents for violation of the blasphemy law, which carries the death sentence.
Even though Pakistan has yet to sentence anyone to death for blasphemy,  a mere accusation can result in widespread riots, causing lynchings and killings
Two years ago, a Sri Lankan man accused of blasphemy was killed by an enraged mob and had his body set on fire. In 2009, a mob burned down about 60 homes and killed six people in the Gorja district in Punjab, after accusing them of insulting Islam.
A 19th century law punishing blasphemy was instituted by the British in colonial times. But in the 1980s, authorities introduced stricter punishments for breaking the law, including a death sentence for anyone who insults Islam.
Around 96% of Pakistan's population is Muslim. Other countries, including Iran, Brunei, and Mauritania also impose capital punishment for insulting religion. 
Religion-fuelled violence in Pakistan has risen since the country made blasphemy punishable by death, as it ""bolsters violent behaviour,"" Iftekharul Bashar, a researcher at the think-tank RSIS who focuses on political and religious violence in South Asia, told the BBC.
""The Pakistani society has experienced increased fragmentation, driven by widening economic disparities, leading to an upsurge in violence directed towards minority religious groups,"" Mr Bashar said. 
""The emergence of extremist and vigilante factions within Pakistan, some of which exhibit significant financial backing, also contributed to this trouble trend,"" he added. 
A local official told BBC Urdu that authorities received calls about protests and fires early Wednesday morning after reports of the two men allegedly desecrating the Quran, the holy book of Islam, circulated on social media. 
Authorities said torn pages of the the sacred text with blasphemous content allegedly scribbled on them in red marker ink, were found near a Christian community. 
The reports circulated around the city and on social media, sparking outrage among the Muslim community. The violence that ensued saw mobs attacking and looting private homes belonging to Christians. 
Yassir Bhatti, a 31-year-old Christian, was one of those to flee their homes.
""They broke the windows, doors and took out fridges, sofas, chairs and other household items to pile them up in front of the Church to be burnt,"" he told AFP news agency.
""They also burnt and desecrated Bibles, they were ruthless.""
Videos on social media show protesters destroying Christian buildings while police appear to watch on. 
Amir Mir, the information minister for Punjab province, condemned the alleged blasphemy and said in a statement that thousands of police had been sent to the area, with dozens of people detained. 
The mob was mostly made up of people from an Islamist political party called Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a government source told Reuters. The TLP has denied any involvement. 
Caretaker PM Anwar ul-Haq Kakar called for swift action against those responsible for the violence.
Pakistani bishop Azad Marshall, in the neighbouring city of Lahore, said the Christian community was ""deeply pained and distressed"" by the events.
""We cry out for justice and action from law enforcement and those who dispense justice, and the safety of all citizens to intervene immediately and assure us that our lives are valuable in our own homeland,"" he posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Brian Houston: Hillsong Church founder cleared of concealing father's abuse,"Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston has been found not guilty of concealing the crimes of his paedophile father.
Australian prosecutors had argued Brian Houston tried to cover up his father's sexual abuse of a child in the 1970s.
The church founder only learned of the abuse decades later and said he did not report it because the victim, by then an adult, did not want police involved.
Frank Houston, who died in 2004, is believed to have used his position as a pastor to abuse as many as nine boys.
Victim Brett Sengstock - who has waived his right to anonymity - was seven when his family hosted the New Zealand preacher at their home while he was on a tour in Sydney.
It was then that Frank Houston sexually abused him for the first time - abuse which continued over several years when the pastor moved to Australia.
Prosecutors had contended Brian Houston was involved in ""hush money"" paid to Mr Sengstock some years later, and that he wielded his powerful influence to further cover up abuse allegations.
They argued that his ""only focus"" in responding to the claim was to protect the Church - that the victim did not want police involved was a convenient excuse for failing to report them.
But on Thursday, Magistrate Gareth Christofi ruled that Mr Houston had a ""reasonable excuse"" under the law not to do so.
""I do not see any reason why a convenient excuse may not also be a reasonable one,"" he said.
Speaking outside court on Thursday, Mr Houston called his father a ""serial paedophile"" and admitted the extent of his crimes will likely never be known.
""But I am not my father. I did not commit this offence,"" the 69-year-old said.
Founded by Brian Houston in Sydney 40 years ago, Hillsong has become a global megachurch known for a brand of modern evangelism that has attracted millions of followers.
It also made Mr Houston one of the world's most famous preachers. He remained the Church's global senior pastor until 2022 when he resigned following allegations he behaved inappropriately towards two women.
The verdict is the culmination of over a decade of speculation about a ""cover-up"" by the Church, and the end of a court battle which has unearthed at-times extraordinary evidence.
Brian Houston has previously described the moment his father - his ""hero"" - confessed he had sexually abused a boy as like ""jets flying into the twin towers of my soul"".
At that time in late 1999, Frank was revered - considered a founding father of the Pentecostal movement in Australia - and Brian himself was on a meteoric trajectory.
Not only did he lead his own congregation - the seed of megachurch Hillsong - Brian led the entire denomination it fell under; then called the Assemblies of God (AOG).
The Sydney court heard evidence that Frank Houston's victim was daunted by the prospect of speaking up about such a powerful family, and felt pressured by both his relatives and the church to keep quiet.
In some of the court case's most shocking evidence, Mr Sengstock detailed meeting Frank Houston at a suburban McDonald's restaurant in late 1999. It was there that the 61-year-old said he was pushed to sign a scrunched-up napkin in exchange for A$10,000 (£5,000; $6,400). 
It is unclear what - if anything - was written on the paper, but Mr Sengstock said: ""I was paid for my silence"".
Mr Houston told the court he knew about the money. He consulted a lawyer over the matter and passed that advice on to his family, he said, before asking them to keep him at ""arm's length"" from it.
Prosecutors argued Mr Houston knew it was ""hush money"", but he told the court he saw it as his father's ""feeble attempt to try and right the wrong"".
Brian's next steps also came under scrutiny in court.
At an emergency meeting in the Qantas lounge at Sydney airport, he told the AOG board of Frank's confession.
Brian said he had immediately sacked his father and that the victim had repeatedly stressed that he did not want police involved - something Mr Sengstock told the court he can't remember ever telling Brian.
The group discussed - then accepted - legal advice which said they did not need to make a report because the victim was an adult, according to minutes of their meeting tendered in court. 
And ultimately, they decided that Frank would be invited to enter its ""restoration program"", refrain from preaching for 12 months and be offered counselling.
The meeting log was then sealed, Frank's ""retirement"" was announced in internal messages, and he was paid a package to leave Hillsong.
While Brian conceded the AOG church could have been more forthright about why Frank was standing down, he said he stood by the decision not to report the allegation to police.
""I believe we did the right thing, that I personally did the right thing,"" he told the court.
Within a year of the meeting in 1999, Brian had learned of more allegations his father had abused several other boys in New Zealand.
However, as more victims came out of the woodwork, Brian still did not go to police. He told the court he didn't think Frank was a danger to the community because he was 82 and the offending was historic.
But his legal team say he spoke openly about Frank's offending.
They pointed to sermons Brian had given where he told thousands of churchgoers about the ""predatory"", ""very serious moral accusations"" made against Frank, and a letter sent to AOG pastors in 2001 using similar language.
Prosecutors had argued Mr Houston had downplayed the seriousness of the allegations, and the court heard from a pastor who had welcomed Frank to the pulpit in the months before his death - something he says he never would have allowed had he realised what the preacher was accused of.
But ultimately Mr Christofi ruled the prosecution case was too ""weak"".
He found that while it was ""quite clearly wrong"" for Mr Houston to be involved in the payment of money to Mr Sengstock, there appeared to be no need to buy his silence.
Whether his reluctance to report aligned with Brian's own personal interest was not relevant, he said.
And proving allegations of a further cover-up was ""a tall order"".
Brian did not dismiss the allegation, he had acted quickly, and while ""euphemistic at times"" he had made it clear he wanted people to know what his father had done. 
""That is the very opposite of a cover-up,"" Mr Christofi said.
After the verdict, Mr Houston called the case against him a ""targeted attack"".
""If I wasn't Brian Houston from Hillsong this charge would never have been laid.""
His feelings of relief were mixed with grief for his father's victims, he said.
""A lot of people's lives have been, tragically, hurt and for that I'll always be very sad.""
Flat too, was Mr Sengstock. Outside court he told reporters he felt the case had exposed how other people had taken it upon themselves to speak for him.
""Clergy child sexual abuse survivors… still do not have a voice in this country.""
He said he'd suffered 45 years of trauma both from the abuse and the response by the Church.
""Regardless of today's outcome, I have received a life sentence.""

Texas woman arrested after threats to Trump judge Tanya Chutkan,"A Texas woman has been charged with threatening to kill a judge who is overseeing a criminal case against former US President Donald Trump.
Abigail Jo Shry, 43, allegedly phoned the court in Washington DC on 5 August and used a racial slur in her message for US District Judge Tanya Chutkan.
Ms Shry also allegedly threatened to kill a Democratic member of Congress.
She admitted making the call after investigators traced her phone number, according to a court document.
In the call, Ms Shry allegedly told the judge, who is overseeing an election conspiracy case against Mr Trump: ""You are in our sights, we want to kill you."" 
Prosecutors say Ms Shry added: ""If Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you."" 
The caller also threatened all Democrats in Washington DC and the LGBT community, according to the court filing.
She allegedly also threatened to kill congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a black Texas Democrat who is running for mayor of Houston.
When federal agents visited Ms Shry's home in the Houston suburb of Alvin three days later she said she had harboured no intention of going to Washington DC to carry out her threats, according to the court filing.
But she allegedly added that ""if Sheila Jackson Lee comes to Alvin, then we need to worry"".
A day before the threatening phone call, Mr Trump had posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, in all capital letters: ""If you go after me, I'm coming after you!"" He had been arraigned a day earlier on the election plot charges.
Last Friday Judge Chutkan warned at a court hearing that both sides should avoid any ""inflammatory statements"" about the case.
Meanwhile, supporters of Mr Trump have posted personal details of the Georgia grand jury members who voted to indict him over election interference allegations earlier this week.
A report by a private investigative organisation found social media users had called for violence to be used against them and Fani Willis - the lead prosecutor in the case against the former president. 
On Monday, a 98-page indictment was unsealed and claimed Mr Trump ""unlawfully conspired"" to change the election outcome while participating in a ""criminal enterprise"".
He denies all charges. Ms Willis has given Mr Trump and 18 other defendants the opportunity to voluntarily surrender no later than noon on 25 August. 
Who is the hard-line judge on Trump's election case?

Maui fire: First victims named as death toll reaches 111,"This video can not be played
Watch: 'This acrid smoke really sticks in your throat'
The first names of people killed by wildfires in Maui have been released by officials, one week after at least 111 people died on the Hawaiian island.
Robert Dyckman, 74, and Buddy Jantoc, 79, were the first to be named. 
On Wednesday night local time in Hawaii, County Maui officials confirmed Melva Benjamin, 71, Virginia Dofa, 90 and Alfredo Galinato, 79, were also killed in the fires.
More than 1,000 people are estimated still to be missing.
The fire, which destroyed the historic town of Lahaina within hours, has been followed by a slow and gruelling search for victims.
Mr Jantoc's body was discovered at his home in an old people's home in Lahaina, the New York Times reported.
Relatives told the newspaper he was known by family as ""Mr Aloha"" and regaled them with tales of his heyday as a bass guitarist playing alongside Carlos Santana and George Benson.
""I'm hoping he was asleep,"" his daughter-in-law said. ""I hope to God he did not suffer.""
Twenty sniffer dogs trained to detect bodies have led teams on a block-by-block search of the wreckage, a 5sq mile (13sq km) area now filled with twisted metal and other debris. 
Another 20 canine teams are expected to join the search, said Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) Administrator Deanne Criswell on Wednesday. 
""This is a really hard disaster. And this is a really difficult search operation,"" she told reporters in Washington DC. ""This is also going to be a very long and hard recovery."" 
Previously on Tuesday evening, Governor Josh Green said 27% of the disaster site had been searched. In a televised address he warned the number of dead could climb significantly and even double over the next 10 days. 
Officials must then complete the difficult work of identifying the dead, a process complicated by the severity of the victims' burns and one that requires forensic experts and DNA samples from family members.

Watch: 'I just want to put my stepfather's body to rest.'
Thirty specialists from federal mortuary teams are already in Maui and will soon be joined by more from the US defence department. 
US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will travel to Hawaii on Monday, the White House said in a statement. 
Mr Biden was asked by a reporter over the weekend about the rising death toll in Hawaii and responded: ""No comment."" The president's apparent delay in visiting Maui, as well as that remark, has angered many locals, who told the BBC they see his absence as a slap in the face. 
""Hey Mr President, how about Hawaii?"" said Chaymen Enomoto. ""'No comment'? That is a big screw you.""
Mr Biden said on Tuesday that he had not yet visited because of concerns it would divert resources and attention from the humanitarian response. Jill Biden will accompany him to Hawaii, he said. 
""I don't want to get in the way. I've been to too many disaster areas,"" he said. ""I want to be sure we don't disrupt ongoing recovery efforts.""
It will probably be a long wait until the full scale of the destruction is understood. The Maui Emergency Management Agency has estimated it will cost $5.52bn (£4.3bn) to rebuild.
""We have officials who don't even want to go back to the site, that's how devastating [it is],"" said Maui resident Koa Gomes. 
Many people told the BBC they were frustrated by the scale and speed of the recovery efforts. 
One resident, Les Munn, said he had so far received $500 (£392) from Fema - less than the price of a night in most hotel rooms on the island.
For now, he is still sleeping in a shelter.
Fema said Wednesday it had sent millions of litres of water and food to the island, and given $2.3m in assistance to families.
But in Lahaina, once Hawaii's royal capital, many people are relying on relief supplies co-ordinated by other Maui locals. Ice, water, clothing and other supplies are being delivered by grassroots groups. 
On Wednesday morning, the Honoapiilani Highway, the primary route into Lahaina, opened to non-residents for the first time since last week's fires. For days, the road was closed even to residents who sat in long queues for hours hoping to get in. 
The road will be open to everyone during the day, with late-night access limited to West Maui residents, employees and first responders. Still, officials have asked that people travel to this part of the island only if necessary to live, work, or volunteer.

"After McDonald's, Burger King India drops tomatoes from its menu","Burger King says it has removed tomatoes from its food in Indian outlets after a sharp rise in prices.
The fast food chain said it made the decision because of ""unpredictable conditions on the quality and supply of tomato crops"".
The burger chain is the second in the country after McDonald's to drop the ingredient from its menu.
Experts say crop damage due to bad weather conditions have caused a shortage in the market.
Earlier this week, US sandwich chain Subway also removed tomatoes from menus as India's food inflation hit its highest since January 2020, reports Reuters. 
It even cancelled the free cheese slices the restaurant offered with the sandwich for years.
Prices of essentials have skyrocketed in India in recent months, with the tomato hitting a peak of 250 rupees ($3; £2.37) per kilo in July as monsoon rains disrupted crop and supply chains. 
Tomato prices have since come down but earlier this month, India began importing it from neighbouring Nepal to manage the supply crisis. 
These are being sold at 50 rupees per kilo in capital Delhi and the northern states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
On Wednesday, Burger King added a new section to its official website in India called, ""Why are there no tomatoes in my burgers?"" 
The food chain said its Indian franchisee followed ""very high standards of quality"" and that tomatoes will be back soon on the menu. 
""Till then we request your patience and understanding,"" it said. 
Last month, McDonald's also dropped tomatoes from most of its outlets in northern and eastern India. 
The fast food giant attributed the decision to quality concerns and not the surge in prices.

"Cash, cars and homes seized in $735m Singapore anti-money laundering raids","Singapore police have seized about S$1bn ($735m; £578m) - including luxury homes, cars and watches - in one of its biggest anti-money laundering probes.
Gold bars, designer handbags, wine and S$23m in cash were among the items seized in the raids.
Police arrested ten people in the operation, all of whom held foreign passports.
Raids of this size are rare in Singapore, which has one of the lowest crime rates in the world.
The Singapore Police Force said in a statement that simultaneous raids were held across the city-state on Tuesday.
It added that 94 properties, including houses in some of the country's most sought after areas, were seized, along with 50 vehicles.
Ten people, aged between 31 and 44, were arrested for alleged money laundering and forgery offences. Police said that those arrested had passports from China, Cambodia, Turkey and Vanuatu.
The group was ""suspected to be involved in laundering the proceeds of crime from their overseas organised crime activities including scams and online gambling,"" according to the police.
""We have zero tolerance for the use of Singapore as a safe haven for criminals,"" said David Chew, director of the police's Commercial Affairs Department, which investigates white-collar crime.
""Our message to these criminals is simple - if we catch you, we will arrest you. If we find your ill-gotten gains, we will seize them. We will deal with you to the fullest extent of our laws,"" he added.
Police said another 12 people were assisting with investigations, while eight others are currently on its wanted list.
The country's central bank and financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said it had been in contact with financial institutions ""where the potentially tainted funds have been identified"".
It added that it would take ""firm action"" against institutions which did not meet official anti-money laundering requirements.

Hunter Biden: The struggles and scandals of the US president's son,"Hunter Biden, the second son of President Joe Biden, is attracting attention once again.
In July, the 53-year-old looked set to resolve tax and gun charges against him and avoid prison time in a plea agreement with prosecutors.
But that deal has since fallen apart, a special counsel now heads a five-year-long federal probe into alleged wrongdoing, and a jury trial appears imminent.
Congressional Republicans are also investigating alleged influence-peddling by the first son, particularly in his foreign business dealings during his father's vice-presidency.
Meanwhile, his personal struggles - from alcohol and drug abuse, to relationship strife - have spilled over into politics in recent years.
So what more do we know about Hunter Biden? 
Born in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1970 to Joe Biden and his first wife Neilia, Hunter was given his mother's maiden name as his first name.
He was only two years old in December 1972 when - less than six weeks after his father's election to the US Senate - a truck rammed into the family car.
The accident took the lives of his mother and his baby sister Naomi, while leaving him with a fractured skull and his older brother Beau with a broken leg.
The elder Mr Biden - who was not in the car - took his oath of office by their bedside in hospital.
Hunter later attended Georgetown University and Yale Law School, graduating in 1996.
Between the two degrees, he joined the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, a Catholic group that serves marginalised communities.
There, he met his first wife, Kathleen Buhle, a lawyer, and they wed in 1993. They have three children - Naomi, Finnegan and Maisy - but the pair split in 2017.
His father is teetotal, but Hunter started drinking as a teenager and confesses he abused cocaine as a college student. He has been in and out of rehab.
In 2013, he signed up for the US Navy Reserves and was sworn in before his father - then the vice-president - in a White House ceremony.
But on his very first day at the naval base, he tested positive for cocaine use and was discharged, something he later said he was ""embarrassed"" by.
According to the New Yorker, he drank excessively after the death of his older brother, Beau, from brain cancer in 2015, sometimes only leaving the house to buy vodka.
""He and Beau were one,"" his daughter Naomi once wrote on Twitter. ""One heart, one soul, one mind.""
During their acrimonious divorce, Ms Buhle accused Hunter of ""spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations) while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills"".
Breaking her silence last year on how the 24-year marriage unravelled, she told Good Morning America: ""He was struggling under a massive drug addiction, and that's heart-breaking and painful and that wasn't who I was married to.""
In his 2021 memoir Beautiful Things, Hunter concedes that his infidelity was the final straw in their marriage.
A DNA test in 2019 found he was ""the biological and legal father"" of a child born to Lunden Alexis Roberts, an exotic dancer from Arkansas.
Hunter claimed to have ""no recollection"" of their encounter in his memoir, but he has settled a paternity suit with Ms Roberts and pays her child support.
None of the Bidens appear to have ever met Navy Roberts, now four years old. But amid a media pressure campaign, President Biden was recently forced to acknowledge his seventh grandchild.
Even before his split from Ms Buhle was finalised, Hunter entered into a relationship with his brother's widow, Hallie Biden.
For about two years, they bonded over the shared and ""very specific grief"" of their loss, he told the New Yorker.
Reports of an ""amicable"" split surfaced in 2019, less than a week after his father launched a third bid for president.
But mere weeks later, Hunter wed South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen after a whirlwind six-day romance. They have one son.
Speaking out in 2019 on his struggle with addiction, he said: ""You don't get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.""
In Beautiful Things, he credits his survival to his family's love, recounting an intervention that ended with his father tightly embracing him and saying: ""I don't know what else to do. I'm so scared. Tell me what to do.""
Hunter has turned in recent years to painting as a form of therapy, telling the New York Times that it ""keeps me away from people and places where I shouldn't be"".
But sales of his artwork - for up to $500,000 a piece - have created an ethics dilemma for the Biden White House.
President Biden has defended his son on multiple occasions, most notably during a presidential debate in 2020.
After Mr Trump took issue with his child's struggles, an emotional Joe Biden responded: ""My son - like a lot of people - had a drug problem. He's fixed it and worked on it, and I'm proud of my son."" 
After graduating from Yale, Hunter worked at MBNA America, a bank holding company headquartered in Delaware and later acquired by Bank of America.
Joe Biden's close ties to the bank - one of the largest employers in Delaware and a top contributor to his political campaigns - earned him the unfavourable moniker of ""the senator from MBNA"".
As Hunter was promoted to the rank of executive vice-president, Joe pushed bankruptcy reform legislation favourable to MBNA through the Senate.
In the early 2000s, while still receiving consulting fees from the bank, Hunter opened a Washington lobbying practice.
It saw him land ""clients with interests that overlapped with [his father's] committee assignments and legislative priorities"", according to Politico Magazine.
The father-son relationship at the time, he told the New Yorker, was that neither would speak to the other about lobbying work.
President Biden has maintained this to be true in the case of more recent allegations of wrongdoing as well.
In 2006, with then-Senator Biden set to re-assume chairmanship of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, Hunter and another relative made an ill-fated purchase of a hedge fund group.
Their tenure at Paradigm Global Advisors extended through Joe Biden's 2008 run for president and selection as vice-president to President Barack Obama.
During this time, the fund was connected with several alleged fraudsters, including a Texas financier convicted of running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in US history.
The Bidens denied any wrongdoing and faced no charges. In 2010, they liquidated the fund and returned money to investors.
Much has been made in recent years about Hunter's foreign business interests while his father was vice-president.
In 2013, he took a founding board seat at BHR, a Chinese private equity firm - first as an unpaid member and later owning a 10% equity stake in the fund.
The company was registered in Shanghai less than a fortnight after Hunter flew with his father on an official vice-presidential trip to China and met BHR's chief executive, but only for ""a cup of coffee"", the first son later said.
After his father left office in 2017, Hunter partnered with Chinese oil tycoon Ye Jianming on a natural gas project in Louisiana.
The deal collapsed after Ye was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges and subsequently went missing.
Hunter's dealings in Ukraine have stoked even more controversy, given that his father was the Obama administration's point man for US-Ukraine relations.
In 2014, he joined the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma Holdings, where he was paid as much as $1.2m (£943,000) per year.
As part of an anti-corruption drive, Vice-President Biden was at the time rallying for the ouster of the country's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.
Mr Shokin was removed by parliament in 2016, but critics argue the prosecutor only lost his job because he was investigating Burisma.
Republicans have alleged both Joe and Hunter Biden received $5m payouts from Burisma executives in exchange for Mr Shokin's firing.
A former business partner to Hunter also testified Joe had been on speakerphone several times during Hunter's calls with various contacts.
Allegations of corruption formed the centrepiece of both President Trump's first impeachment in 2019, and emerging efforts to impeach President Biden.

Watch: Why Hunter Biden is important to Republicans
A laptop abandoned by Hunter at a Delaware repair shop, and the seedy contents of its hard drive, also featured prominently in the 2020 presidential campaign.
The Biden team argued at the time it was a ""smear campaign"" engineered by Russian disinformation, but the hard drive has since been authenticated by US media and seized by the FBI.
Analysis of its contents has provided proof of Hunter's extensive earnings from his work in China and Ukraine, as well as evidence of his alcohol- and drug-fuelled escapades.
As the president revs up his re-election campaign, his strategists will be hoping the fallout from his son's legal drama and tabloid-friendly life does not prove an unwelcome distraction.

Ukraine war: University students grapple with rules under conflict,"Ukraine's students are getting used to disruption.
Outside Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, a university here in the country's capital, a group of student volunteers are helping new applicants to enrol. 
Anna explains that some of the current students have never attended a class here in person. 
""They were accepted during the Covid [pandemic], and then Russia's full-scale invasion happened, so they were never really in class offline. It's a little bit sad.""
But she and her fellow volunteers explain that things are different now, with students returning to in-person lectures this year, despite the ongoing war.
That means parents have even more questions than usual.
""They ask pretty often if we have enough places in shelters if [their children] come and study here,"" Anna says. 
And it also means even further pressure on students deciding whether and where to go to university. 
Under war-time government rules, no man aged between 18 and 60 can leave Ukraine without special permission from the authorities. 
That means male students who decide to study in Ukraine cannot travel abroad until the war is over. And while currently students are exempt from being drafted into the army, those rules could change if Ukraine suddenly needs more men. 
It also means male students thinking of studying abroad have to leave before they turn 18: crucially, they are unable to return home to visit without then risking getting stuck inside their own borders.
Russia's war is opening a gender divide in Ukrainian society. 
Liza fled west when Russia launched its assault on Ukraine last year, and settled eventually in Germany.
She's now planning to study sciences in the southern city of Konstanz there, on the border with Switzerland, after she's passed a mandatory German language course.
The 17-year-old has returned home briefly to Kyiv to prepare for university. 
""I'm relying on the chance to buy something in Germany because they've got more shops open - many shops I liked in Kyiv closed,"" she says. ""But it's more expensive there. So I'll thrift in Kyiv before I go!""
Liza says that of her 32 classmates at school in Ukraine, half have chosen to study abroad - both boys and girls. She says the male students in her year have accepted the rules.
""It's not even discussed. Boys don't blame anyone, they understand it's the rules and they should be obeyed,"" she says. ""But they try also to leave - they're [just] 16, 17, 18 years old.""
Misha, 17, struggled this year to decide where to apply. 
""You have a lot more opportunities [elsewhere] in Europe,"" he says. ""You have a lot more nightlife. For a 17-year-old guy like me, I want to have some crazy stuff going on - I know in Kyiv the only thing I can do after midnight is stay at home, because of the curfew.""
But ultimately he realised he couldn't leave his family and his friends.
""My parents were pressuring me so hard to go somewhere because I might get drafted into the army, I might get killed by a rocket,"" he says. ""But I'm not afraid. Maybe it's my mistake, but I don't care, that's how I want to live.""
Misha says he also wants to stay in Ukraine to focus on his plans for the future, and to help rebuild the country. He makes electronic music under the name ""shlepok"", meaning ""slap"" in Ukrainian, and wants to keep growing his presence here in Kyiv. 
""I'm very optimistic about Ukraine,"" he says. ""With people like me and my friends... I think we can make Ukraine great.""
He's not alone. Stephan is also a 17-year-old student, based here in Kyiv. Unlike Misha, he applied and was accepted to a university in Poland. 
But instead of leaving his country, he's decided to study remotely from Ukraine, and has signed up for additional courses with universities at home. 
""My parents wanted me to go to Poland,"" he says. ""I wanted to stay in Ukraine.""
Stephan is not just studying - he is working as the creative director of a marketing agency called Hooligan Bureau. He walks us around the 24th floor of a building near Kyiv's Polytechnic Institute where they're making an office for clients. 
He thinks there's no time to waste to develop his country. 
""The war will end soon, and we'll need to rebuild Ukraine,"" Stephan says. ""Everything is dependent on [individual] Ukrainians. We are a strong nation, and we can make everything happen.""
Before the war, Stephan says travel was important to him - he's been across Europe, to the US, even to some parts of Asia. He says he's happy in Ukraine for now. Once the war is over though, he has plans to travel again.
""I'd like to visit all the countries that had helped Ukraine most,"" he says. ""I want to create a project, 'A thank you for countries', with nations that have supported Ukraine, like the UK and lots of countries in the EU.""
That would be his second trip though. ""I want to go to Russia and hit everyone in the face!"" he jokes.

Trevian Kutti: Who is ex-Kanye West publicist indicted alongside Trump?,"A celebrity stylist and former Kanye West publicist is among 19 individuals indicted with former President Donald Trump for alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia. 
Trevian Kutti, a Trump supporter, is accused of involvement in a plot to pressure a Fulton County election worker to falsely admit ballot fraud.
The Chicago-based publicist is charged under Georgia's racketeering law. 
Ms Kutti posted online a screenshot of a TMZ article about her indictment. 
The charge sheet accuses her of helping to conspire ""to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favour of Trump"". 
The 98-page court document alleges that Ms Kutti was recruited by Harrison Floyd, the leader of Black Voices for Trump and a co-defendant in the case, to travel to Atlanta, where she was to contact Ruby Freeman, an election worker. 
Ms Kutti has previously said the depiction of the meeting in the indictment is false. The BBC has reached out to her for comment. 
She allegedly lied to Ms Freeman's neighbour, saying she was a ""crisis manager"" who had come to help the vote counter.
Ms Freeman was falsely accused of being a ""professional vote scammer"" and ""political operative"" by Mr Trump in the weeks and months after the 2020 election. 
Many of the former president's supporters also baselessly accused Ms Freeman and her daughter, Shaye Moss, of being part of an illegal scheme to input 18,000 false ballots for President Joe Biden into election counting machines.
During testimony to the US House of Representatives select committee last year, the mother and daughter said the voter fraud claims had left them living in fear.
According to the indictment, Ms Freeman met the publicist at a Cobb County Police Department precinct on 4 January 2021. 
During the meeting, Ms Kutti allegedly asked Ms Freeman to confess to voter fraud and told her she was ""in danger"".
Ms Kutti allegedly also warned people would come to Ms Freeman's home in 48 hours if she didn't confess. 
After Ms Freeman's accusations about Ms Kutti became public in 2021, Pierre Rougier, a spokesperson for Kanye West, said Ms Kutti was not connected with the musician at the time she contacted the election worker. 
""Trevian Kutti was not associated with Kanye West or any of his enterprises at the times of the facts that are reported in these articles or since these facts occurred,"" said Mr Rougier. 
According to the indictment, Ms Kutti was in contact with alleged co-conspirators Harrison Floyd and Stephen Lee, a pastor from Illinois, several times before she travelled to Atlanta. Mr Floyd also allegedly spoke to Ms Freeman on the phone while Ms Kutti was with her.
The three face a charge of conspiracy to commit solicitation of false statements and writings for allegedly trying to coerce Ms Freeman to say she had committed election fraud. 
In 2021, Ms Kutti, who has also lobbied for cannabis companies in Illinois, posted on social media that the allegations of the details of her meeting with Ms Freeman were false. 
She wrote: ""Fake news collectives used my prior work with Kanye West to negatively associate us to Trump.""

The baby at the centre of an India-Germany diplomatic row,"She loves Indian food and in videos shared by her parents appears joyful in their company.
But Baby M, two-and-a-half-years-old, is now in a centre for children with special needs near the German city of Berlin, her mother says. 
The toddler has been at the centre of a diplomatic row between India and Germany after she was taken away from her Indian family on accusations of child abuse in September 2021 - when she was only seven months old. 
In June this year, a court in Berlin terminated the parental rights of Dia and her husband Amit - we are not using their real names for legal reasons - and the baby's custody was handed over to Jugendamt or the Youth Welfare Office of Germany. The court also rejected the parents' demand to repatriate the child to India. The parents have called it a ""sham trial"" and filed an appeal. 
Dia, who is currently in Delhi to drum up support in her fight to bring the child back to India, dissolves into tears while talking to the BBC about being separated from her daughter. 
The family moved to Berlin in 2018 when Amit got a job there and Baby M was born on 2 February 2021.
According to court documents, at the centre of the family's row with the authorities is a genital injury Baby M suffered when she was seven months old. It has one doctor saying that they'd ""never seen such a severe genital injury in an infant"" and that she needed surgery to fix it.
The child protection services took her away saying they suspected sexual abuse - an accusation the family denied. The hospital where she was treated cleared them later, with doctors certifying that ""there was no evidence"" to suggest sexual abuse and the police closed the case without pressing charges. 
The parents say they believe the injury was accidental. Two independent doctors from the US and India who saw the baby's medical records agreed with that assessment. 
""The injury highly likely was caused by an accident. It was impossible that parents intentionally inflicted injuries on her repeatedly and then rushed her to the doctors,"" they said in a report submitted in court. They added that they believed that ""her injuries could've been worsened because of all the invasive examinations"" she was put through. 
But the child protection authorities said they didn't think that Baby M would be safe at home - a contention the court agreed with.
So, she has now spent nearly two years in foster care, and her parents say they have been allowed little contact with her - despite social workers who were assigned to the family describing them as ""loving and caring"" parents and describing the child's interactions with them as ""consistently positive, joyful and curious"". A court-appointed psychologist also recommended that one of the parents live with Baby M in a parent-child facility supervised by a caregiver.
But last week, Jugendamt informed the parents that ""all visitations with their daughter have been cancelled as there is no one to pick and drop her"", says Dia, alleging that they have not even been allowed to video-call the child. 
""We have no information on who is caring for her since she was moved from foster care to the centre for children with special needs. The secrecy surrounding our baby is totally bizarre."" 
Dia accuses the German authorities of ""snatching my child because of cultural differences and miscommunication"" - she says she can't speak German and the translator she was given spoke Hindi but did not know Gujarati. The BBC has reached out to Jugendamt and their response is awaited. 
Baby M's case has received a lot of attention in India and Germany - protests have been held in several Indian cities and by the Indian diaspora in Frankfurt and Darmstadt and support has poured in for the parents. 
In Delhi, Dia has met officials from the Indian ministry of external affairs (MEA) and lobbied dozens of MPs who have sent a letter to the German Ambassador Phillip Ackerman to repatriate the toddler to India.
An MP urged the government to take the necessary steps to bring her back.  Another politician asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take up the matter with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz when he visits Delhi next month for the G-20 summit. 
Dia too is now appealing to the prime minister to intervene. ""My only hope is Mr Modi now. If he intervenes, my daughter can come back,"" she says.
The dispute over Baby M has revived memories of a similar case from 2011 when two Indian children were taken from their parents in Norway. They were eventually returned to India a year later. 
Suranya Aiyar, former lawyer and activist who helped the Indian family in Norway and is now helping Baby M's parents, says such cases are not uncommon.
""It's a significant problem. The assumption is that it's a brilliant solution, and needs no further discussion.""
The role of Jugendamt in cross-border family disputes has also been criticised by the European Parliament. In a scathing report in 2018, the EP accused the organisation of discrimination, being unfair to children of migrants, and harming the rights of both parents and the children they confiscate. 
In a new report released in May, the EP said its Committee on Petitions still receives complaints about Jugendamt. ""The role and actions of youth welfare offices are often seen as too far-reaching… Foreign parents feel disadvantaged compared to German parents."" 
A better solution in cases like these, Ms Aiyar says, would be for the state to assign social workers to help families look after their children.
In Baby M's case, she says, the only solution is for the government to step in.
""The child has done no wrong. Let her return to India. She's an Indian citizen and she has every right to be here."" 
The Indian government has said the case is being given ""high priority"". MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said earlier this month that they had ""summoned the German Ambassador"" to convey India's concerns.
""At a minimum we believe this child's cultural rights and rights as an Indian are being infringed upon,"" Mr Bagchi said at a media briefing. ""We have asked for the early return of the child to India and we will continue to press Germany on this matter,"" he added. 
A German embassy spokesman in Delhi refused to comment on the case. But government sources in Germany said the case was in court and out of their hands, adding that they were working with India to find a resolution to the case. 
Indian authorities say they have identified a family in Gujarat - the western Indian state to which the family belongs - where Baby M can be placed in foster care.
Dr Kiran Aggarwal, retired government paediatrician and former member of the child welfare committee of the Delhi government, says the child should be with her parents.
""India has very robust child protection laws and if the German court repatriates her, she can be looked after in India,"" she said. 
As time passes, Dia says each day adds to her worry that she's losing her child bit by bit. 
""She's not being able to learn her mother tongue Gujarati. She only speaks German, how will I be able to speak to her?"" she asks.
The family is also struggling to pay the 9m rupees ($108,477; £85,554) they have been ordered to fork out for foster care and court costs.
""We raised money through crowdfunding and have already paid 5m rupees. We are a middle-class family. They have broken us morally and emotionally, now they are trying to break us financially too,"" she says.

Syria doubles public-sector pay and cuts subsidies as economy sinks,"Syria's government has doubled public sector pay while at the same time cut fuel subsidies, as it tries to boost the war-torn country's economy.
The announcements were made overnight, after the value of the Syrian pound fell to a new low against the US dollar on the parallel, or black, market.
The currency's collapse has helped fuel hyperinflation and push 90% of the population below the poverty line. 
The hardship has recently sparked rare protests in government strongholds.
Syria has been devastated and more than half a million people have been killed by the civil war that erupted after President Bashar al-Assad cracked down violently on peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations in 2011.
More than 15 million people - 70% of the population - require humanitarian assistance, with 12.1 million considered food insecure.
Presidential decrees issued early on Wednesday ordered a 100% increase in the salaries and pensions of civil servants, military personnel and government contractors - the first such rise since December 2021.
They also set the overall minimum monthly wage for all workers at 185,940 Syrian pounds, which is worth $21.76 (£17.09) at the official exchange rate of 8,542 and $12.40 at the current parallel market rate of 15,000. At the start of the war, a dollar was worth 47 Syrian pounds.
The new minimum wage would only be enough to buy a third of the essential food that the World Food Programme (WFP) calculates a family of five requires each month, according to data from May. It would also cover just over a tenth of such a family's minimum household expenditure.
Vulnerable households have been struggling to pay their bills due to spiralling inflation, with the minimum expenditure figure 62% higher than it was in May 2022 and 159% higher than in September 2021, according to the WFP. 
In a separate statement issued overnight, the commerce ministry announced the total lifting of subsidies on petrol and a partial lifting of subsidies on fuel oil. The price of petrol will rise to 8,000 Syrian pounds ($0.53) per litre from 3,000 pounds, and fuel oil to 2,000 pounds per litre from 700 pounds.
Prime Minister Hussein Arnous said last year that cutting fuel subsidies would ensure the poorest families benefited, reduce the budget deficit and help stabilise the Syrian pound.
However, economists have noted that his government cannot afford to maintain the subsidies. 
They have also warned that the public sector pay rise is likely to further increase inflation and the Syrian pound's depreciation, meaning that the economic benefit could be all but wiped out within months. 
Officials have blamed the economic crisis and the hardship among its ordinary Syrians on strict US sanctions imposed in 2019, which targeted any foreign person or entity knowingly providing support to Mr Assad's government. The US have said the measures do not affect humanitarian aid.

Wagner cements Belarus presence as 'educational organisation',"The Russian mercenary group Wagner has been listed as an ""educational organisation"" in Belarus.
Media reports on Wednesday revealed that the group had been registered as a limited company on 4 August.
The place of registration corresponds to the area where Wagner troops are believed to be based.
Its members were allowed to move to Belarus as part of a deal to end a mutiny in Russia in June, in which its forces sought to march on Moscow.
Since then Wagner forces have been seen arriving at a camp south of Minsk and training Belarusian troops.
According to the Single State Registry of Companies and Individual Entrepreneurs of Belarus, Wagner registered for ""educational activities"" at the village of Tsel in Osipovichi district, the same location as their new base.
Media reports say a real estate company, Concord Management and Consulting, was registered at the same address last month.
Concord is said to be 100% owned by a Russian company of the same name, whose director general is Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin.
Last month the BBC verified the location of the camp at Tsel and the arrival of Wagner troops there, who were welcomed by Prigozhin.
The mutiny in June saw Wagner mercenaries seize military facilities in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don following tensions between its leadership and the Russian general staff over the conduct of the war in Ukraine.
Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko helped broker a deal between Wagner and the Russian authorities to end the mutiny, allowing its fighters a choice between joining the Russian army or going to Belarus.
He said they might be called upon to defend his country, adding that a close eye would be kept on them.

Police sent to some ATMs after Bank of Ireland glitch ,"This video can not be played
Queues formed after a Bank of Ireland glitch allowed extra cash withdrawals
At a glance
A Bank of Ireland glitch led to customers being able to withdraw large sums even if they had little or no funds in their accounts
Queues formed at some cash machines in the Republic of Ireland
The bank says it is has now resolved the technical issues 
It has warned transfers and withdrawals will be applied to customers’ accounts
Irish police said they received a handful of calls concerning public order incidents at some cash machines
Bank of Ireland technical faults that allowed people to withdraw funds despite having little or no money in their accounts led to officers being sent to some cash machines, gardaí (Irish police) have said.
Large queues formed at many cash machines in the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday after word of the glitch spread.
Posts on social media also appeared to show officers seemingly deployed to cash machines.
The bank said on Wednesday morning that the issues had been resolved and apologised for the disruption.
It warned transfers and withdrawals would still be applied to customers’ accounts.
Gardaí said they had received more than 40 calls from members of the public between 20:00 local time and midnight about an unusual volume of activity at some cash machines across the country.
A handful of calls concerned public order incidents at some cash machines.
One call was made in relation to an assault.
A spokesperson said events involved a ""complicated set of circumstances"" surrounding large sums of money during a ""developing and escalating situation"".
""In response to this dynamic and evolving situation and to ensure public safety, decisions were made locally on a case-by-case basis depending on the circumstances presenting to control rooms and operational members,"" they added.

Bank of Ireland said the technical issues also affected customers in Northern Ireland, but that it ""didn’t have similar reports of customers using Northern Ireland ATMs late last night"". 
It added that overnight payments to accounts might appear throughout Wednesday.
""We are aware that the technical issue meant some customers were able to withdraw or transfer funds above their normal limits,"" the spokesperson said.
""These transfers and withdrawals will be applied to customers’ accounts today.""
""We urge any customer who may find themselves in financial difficulty due to overdrawing on their account to contact us.""

The problems first emerged on Tuesday afternoon when customers were unable to access the services although contactless, card and cash machine services were unaffected.
Reports on social media suggested that some customers had been able to transfer more money than they had in their Bank of Ireland accounts to other external accounts and then withdraw the cash.
One man queuing outside an ATM in Stoneybatter, Dublin told the Irish Times he had heard about the glitch on the internet and intended to take advantage of it. 
“I don’t know if I’ll get away with it but it’s worth a shot,” he said.

Canada excluded as China loosens group travel bans,"Canada has been left out as China lifted a restrictions on group tours to multiple countries, including the US and the UK. 
It suggests a deterioration of relations following Canada's recent accusations that Beijing meddled in its politics.
Chinese officials said Canada was excluded over the foreign interference claims.
It could have a significant impact on Canada's tourism industry. 
Chinese tourists were estimated to have injected over C$1bn (£580m;$740m) into the Canadian economy annually in years prior to the Covid pandemic. 
China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism regulates which countries Chinese tour operators can visit, saying it's done to safeguard citizens travelling abroad. 
But it has also been viewed as a political tool to advance China's political agenda overseas.
Last week, China added 78 countries to its list of approved destinations for group tours, excluding Canada while adding other major G20 countries like the US, Germany, Australia, and South Korea. 
There are currently 138 countries on the list.
In a statement, China's embassy in Ottawa said it was concerned that ""the Canadian side has repeatedly hyped up the so-called 'Chinese interference'"". 
Beijing is focused on ""protecting the safety and legitimate rights of overseas Chinese citizens and wishes they can travel in a safe and friendly environment"", the statement said. 
Diplomatic relations between the two countries deteriorated rapidly earlier this year. It happened amid a series of leaks to Canadian media of reports from domestic intelligence agencies that laid out accusations that China meddled in recent federal elections. 
Canada has also accused Beijing of trying to intimidate Conservative member of parliament Michael Chong and waging a disinformation campaign against him on the popular Chinese messaging app WeChat. 
Chinese diplomat Zhao Wei was expelled from Canada in May over some of the allegations. In a tit-for-tat move, China expelled Jennifer Lynn Lalonde, Canada's diplomat in its Shanghai consulate. 
The BBC has reached out to Global Affairs Canada for comment on the tourism snub. 
Destination Canada, which promotes tourism in the country, told broadcaster CBC that China accounts for the largest source of tourist arrivals from the Asia-Pacific region. It is also its second-largest long-haul market after the UK. 
More than 700,000 Chinese tourists travelled to Canada in 2018, according to a 2021 report by the Canada China Business Council, with each visitor spending an average of C$2,600. 
At the time, the business group warned that bilateral tensions made the future of Chinese tourism to Canada ""uncertain"", noting that ""comments made by Chinese officials alluded to the contingency of Chinese tourism on positive relations"". 
Group tours from China to Canada were first approved in 2010, and it boosted air travel and tourism between the two countries.
In 2018, bilateral relations suffered a set back when Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was detained in Canada at the request of the US. 
Two Canadians were arrested in China not long after, in a move viewed by Canada and its allies as ""hostage diplomacy"".
The number of tourists to Canada from China fell in 2019, according to the Canada China Business Council. 
Ms Meng and both men were released in 2021.  after the Huawei executive came to a deal with US prosecutors. 
China began easing pandemic travel restrictions for both visitors and its citizens early this year.

"Dominican Republic blast kills dozens, including a baby","More than two dozen people, including a four-month-old baby, have died in an explosion which rocked the small town of San Cristóbal, in the Dominican Republic, on Monday.
The death toll rose from 11 to 25 on Wednesday as the search for survivors continued.
It is not yet known what caused the blast in the town's commercial area.
Smoke from the explosion and the fires it ignited could be seen wafting over the town for many hours afterwards.
President Luis Abinader, who visited the site of the explosion, said on Tuesday that ""we are doing all that is humanly possible to locate"" the missing.
Dozens of people were injured and many remain in hospital. 
Hundreds of firefighters are still trying to extinguish the flames in four of the nine buildings which caught fire. 
The explosion ripped through the town, on the south-western outskirts of the capital Santo Domingo, on Monday afternoon. 
Its exact source has not yet been pinpointed. Among the buildings destroyed are a hardware shop, a veterinary clinic and a plastics factory.

Saudi scrutiny can only be a good thing - Shearer,"Fundraising for the Alan Shearer Foundation will take place during the golf tour
At a glance
Alan Shearer says Saudi Arabia's involvement in sport will lead to more scrutiny
He said it ""can only be a good thing"" that people were asking questions
His foundation has accepted a donation from Saudi-backed LIV golf league
He said the answer to any offer of funds was ""always a yes""
Former Newcastle United and England footballer Alan Shearer has said the more Saudi Arabia is involved in sport, the more the regime will be scrutinised.
More people were asking questions ""and that can only be a good thing"", he said.
Shearer was responding to questions about concerns over his charity accepting a donation from the Saudi-backed LIV golf league.
He said that during a cost of living crisis, the answer to any offer of funds was ""always a yes"".
The Match of the Day pundit's charity, the Alan Shearer Foundation, provides respite, residential care and activities for people with complex disabilities.
It has accepted a donation of $25,000 (£19,600) from LIV and fundraising will also take place throughout its Asian Tour event at Close House near Newcastle.
The foundation's facilities are provided for free but this means funds have to be raised to cover running costs, Shearer said.
""So, whenever anyone asks if they can be involved with it, then it's always a yes because times are tough nowadays,"" he said.
""We still have the raise the money somehow.""
However, Shearer said he understood concerns about where the money was coming from.
""I think it's important that we talk about that and ask questions about that,"" he said.
""It's such a big part of sport now that we have to accept that LIV and the Saudis are in.
""But I think, because of their involvement now, then more people are asking the questions and that can only be a good thing.
""The more questions that people have to answer then the better it can be.""
Two Saudi Arabia friendlies are to be held at St James' Park
A Saudi Arabia-backed takeover of Shearer's former club, Newcastle United, in 2021 caused controversy because of the country's poor human rights record.
Amnesty International called for the deal to be re-examined by the Premier League earlier this year.
On Wednesday, the organisation's chief executive, Sacha Deshmukh, criticised the decision to hold two Saudi international matches at St James' Park, calling it another example of ""how sportswashing works"".

Rico: Rudy Giuliani jailed mobsters with a charge he now faces,"As a federal prosecutor in the 1980s, Rudy Giuliani made headlines around the world for aggressively going after New York's organised crime families. 
To do so, he pioneered the use of a federal anti-racketeering act aimed at prosecuting ongoing criminal ""enterprises"". 
Nearly 40 years later, the one-time New York City mayor is facing a similar act as a defendant in Georgia's election inquiry. 
Mr Giuliani has denied any wrongdoing. 
The act, formerly known as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act - or Rico - was passed by Congress in 1970 in a bid to help prosecutors piece together complex cases involving criminal bosses who gave orders and the lower level underlings that carried them out.
In the early 1980s, Mr Giuliani famously used the Rico Act to aggressively target the ""Five Families"" of New York City's Italian-American mafia. 
Since 1931, the families had been governed by ""the Commission"", a national ruling body that oversaw the activities of approximately 1,000 ""made"" members of the mob and a vast network of several thousand other ""associates"" across New York, New Jersey and further afield.
The investigation - which involved hundreds of FBI agents and New York police officers - saw extensive use of listening devices, discreetly placed in locations including an East Harlem social club and a mob driver's Jaguar used to ferry gangsters across the city. 
The surveillance effort resulted in hundreds of hours of taped conversations, giving investigators a detailed look at the inner workings of the mafia and how decisions made by its senior leaders in the Commission trickled down to criminal activity on the streets. 
Armed with this information, Mr Giuliani took the case to a federal grand jury and, in 1985, obtained indictments against 11 mob leaders and their lieutenants. Eight were eventually convicted and most were sentenced to 100 years in prison.
While Rico prosecutions had been used before - notably against the Hells Angels motorcycle gang in California in the late 1970s - Mr Giuliani and his allies have long lauded its use as one of his prime accomplishments before becoming mayor. 
""Using it against the Commission,"" Mr Giuliani told the New York Times in 1989. ""That was an idea that no one had until I developed it and went down to Washington and started talking about it.""
Nearly 37 years after the Commission trial's verdicts came down, Mr Giuliani, now 79, is facing Georgia's version of the Rico act as a defendant alongside former US president Donald Trump and 17 other people accused of attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 US election. 
In a dramatic twist, the once popular Mr Giuliani is facing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who frequently touts the use of the same Rico act that made Mr Giuliani famous as a prosecutor. 
""I have right now more Rico indictments in the last 18 months, 20 months, than were probably done in the last 10 years out of this office,"" she told the Washington Post in January. 
Mr Giuliani has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In a Monday statement, he called the Georgia indictment an ""affront to American democracy"" that does ""permanent, irrevocable harm"" to the US justice system.
""The real criminals here are the people who have brought this case forward both directly and indirectly,"" he said.

What is racketeering? Trump charged with mafia-busting law in Georgia,"The first count in the Georgia indictment charges Donald Trump and 18 others with racketeering for their alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state.  
Announcing the charges, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis implicated the former president in a sprawling election subversion conspiracy, with him as the ringleader.
""The indictment alleges that rather than abide by Georgia's legal process for election challenges, the defendants engaged in a criminal, racketeering enterprise to overturn Georgia's presidential election results,"" she said.
These are the fourth set of criminal charges brought against Mr Trump in recent months, but it is the first time a former American president faces charges once used to convict mob bosses like John Gotti and Vincent Gigante.
Organised criminal activity in the US is routinely prosecuted under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act.
Rico laws help prosecutors connect the dots between underlings who broke laws and those who gave them marching orders.
More than 30 US states have implemented their own versions of the federal government's Rico Act and Georgia's adaptation is broader in scope than most.
Federal Rico statutes list 35 crimes that would qualify as evidence of racketeering, but Georgia's Rico laws choose from a list of 65.
Prosecutors are required to show that a criminal ""enterprise"" exists and to detail a pattern of racketeering that rests on at least two qualifying crimes.
The Rico Act is a storytelling tool prosecutors can use ""to really capture what happened here in the aftermath of the election and to prosecute the full scope of the conspiracy,"" says Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University.
""There were so many different bad actors in Georgia working to undermine the election and to overthrow the vote count. Donald Trump is at the centre of it, but he was working in a broader orbit.""
Penalties under Georgia's Rico Act are steep - prison terms between five and 20 years, or fines of up to $250,000 (£197,000) - and can help persuade subordinates to cut deals with the prosecution in exchange for lesser sentences.
Such incidents could generate a wave of never-before-seen evidence and testimony prosecutors can use against the alleged ringleaders, Mr Kreis argues.
But to convict Mr Trump himself, prosecutors will have to show the former president was ""not some kind of passive participant"" following legal advice, but the man ""driving the bus"", he says.
The campaign was ""very sloppy, left a paper trail everywhere they went and had no shame in covering up what they did,"" says Mr Kreis. ""That means there are nuggets of information out there.""
Mr Trump is already facing federal charges from the US Department of Justice over his false election claims, in a trial whose evidence could factor into, and overlap with, the case in Georgia.
He is also awaiting trial over his alleged mishandling of classified documents and his hush-money payments to a porn star.
District Attorney Willis, a Democrat, has used the state's racketeering laws for high-profile prosecutions in the past.
In 2013, she led the prosecution - on Rico charges - of Atlanta public school teachers and administrators accused of cheating on state-run standardised tests in order to secure bonuses and promotions.
""You don't, under Rico, have to have a formal, sit-down dinner meeting where you eat spaghetti,"" Ms Willis explained as she indicted nearly three dozen educators about a decade ago.
""But what you do have to do is all be doing the same thing for the same purpose. You all have to be working towards that same goal.""
Eleven of 12 officials were ultimately convicted at trial, the longest in state history, with most other co-conspirators taking guilty pleas.
Last year, Ms Willis leaned on Rico statutes again to allege that Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug and 27 associates at his YSL music label are a ""criminal street gang"".
""The reason that I am a fan of Rico is, I think jurors are very, very intelligent,"" she said at a news conference to announce the charges.
""They want to know what happened. They want to make an accurate decision about someone's life. And so Rico is a tool that allows a prosecutor's office and law enforcement to tell the whole story.""
But a trial that was set to begin this past January is now eight months into a glacial jury selection process, with thousands of jurors excused and not a single juror seated.
That has left Young Thug sitting in jail for 15 months, while a handful of his YSL co-defendants have taken plea deals or had their cases separated from the trial.
""I am hoping Fani Willis has learned from this YSL case when Donald Trump's case finally gets to that level,"" said Keisha Steed, an Atlanta defence attorney. ""The way it's playing out has been a mess!""
She said Ms Willis's office did not seem ""prepared for the number of jurors that they had to call in, the logistics of having everybody be in one place, the time it takes for all attorneys to question jurors"".
The plodding pace of Young Thug's trial has set it on course to beat the record set by the Atlanta educators' trial as the longest in state history.
That is not unusual for multi-defendant and multi-attorney Rico cases, which can create major backlogs in the legal system.
""The whole courthouse is basically closed,"" said Meg Strickler, another local defence attorney.
""I hate the Rico Act,"" she added, saying clients are frequently intimidated by the penalties they could face, and the time and money needed to defend themselves.
And, given how lengthy and complicated Rico trials are, she expects the Trump trial will prove a confusing and uncomfortable affair for a jury, if one can eventually be seated.
""Jurors are going to fall asleep long before they understand it,"" Ms Strickler predicted.

Ireland ATM: Queues form as bank glitch allows extra cash withdrawals,"This video can not be played
Long queues formed at cash machines across the Republic of Ireland, after technical faults led to customers being able to withdraw large sums while having little or no funds in their accounts.
The glitch, which affected some Bank of Ireland ATMs, lasted for several hours on Tuesday, and it now appears to have been resolved.
Irish police said they were aware of an unusual volume of activity around some cash points, and deployed officers outside banks.
Some customers were allowed to transfer up to €1,000 (£850) from their accounts, the Irish Times reported.
The bank has apologised for the outage, but also warned customers that any money withdrawn over normal limits would be ""applied to their accounts.""

Lithuania closes two Belarus border crossings,"Lithuania is to close two of its six border crossings with Belarus.
The two rural crossing points, which are not used by commercial vehicles, will be closed from Friday.
The government said the decision was in response to changes in the geopolitical situation and threats to national security, as well as smuggling. 
Belarus's western neighbours have increased security since Minsk granted shelter to fighters from Russia's Wagner mercenary group.
This came as part of a deal to end a brief mutiny in Russia by Wagner in June.
The Lithuanian government said the crossings at Tverecius and Sumskas will be closed, and traffic will be diverted to Medininkai, the largest of its six checkpoints.
Deputy Minister of Transport Agnė Vaiciukeviciute told the Associated Press that the closures were temporary.
Poland has also sharply restricted access from Belarus, and on Tuesday, Latvia ordered reinforcements to its border.  
Latvian PM Krisjanis Karins said Belarus needed to know his country was serious about securing its borders for the good of its own people, and the rest of Europe.
""We have seen that this summer the pressure from Belarus is not decreasing, but gradually increasing,"" Mr Karins said. 
""We are simply increasing our presence and sending a clear signal to both our own society and the Belarusian authorities that this is no joke.""
Poland announced last week it was sending 10,000 extra troops to its border with Belarus following an alleged incursion by Belarusian military helicopters.
Its government says they'll help to guard against mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group who have moved to Belarus after Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki warned that Wagner fighters could pose as migrants and enter the EU.
Concerns have been rising among the neighbours of Belarus - a close ally of Russia - since June, when a mutiny by Wagner challenged President Vladimir Putin's authority.
A deal ended a 24-hour rebellion, which saw the troops seize the southern Russian city of Rostov and march on Moscow - aborting the march just 200km (124 miles) from the capital.
Under the agreement, Wagner fighters were told they could either join the regular Russian army or go to Belarus.

Libya militias battle in Tripoli after commander's arrest,"Two powerful militias that back Libya's UN-supported government have clashed in the capital, Tripoli, killing 55 people and injuring 146 others, medics say.
The fierce fighting, which erupted on Monday until late on Tuesday, forced the city's main airport to close.
It only subsided after one side released a commander whose detention had triggered the fighting.
Libya remains in political chaos after long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed in 2011.
The country is effectively now split between an interim, internationally recognised government in Tripoli and another one in the east.
A 2020 ceasefire has brought a measure of peace, but entrenched factionalism on all sides constantly threatens to upset it.
Fighting has left many people trapped in their homes as battles took place in several districts of the capital, including Ain Zara in the south-east.
The latest violence was between brigades that operate in Tripoli, where Prime Minster Abdul Hamid Mohammed Dbeibah heads a government.
The Special Deterrence Force, which controls the airport, arrested a senior commander from the 444 Brigade as he tried to travel on Monday.
The commander had once been an officer in the rival militia, the Reuters news agency reports.
According to Libya's Emergency Medicine and Support Center, 234 families had to be evacuated from frontline areas with 60 ambulances deployed and three field hospitals set up to deal with the causalities.
The prime minister intervened and managed to get the commander released to a ""neutral party"", the AFP news agency reports.
He later toured the neighbourhoods affected to see the scale of the damage.
The airport reopened later on Wednesday, AFP says.
The UN mission said it was concerned about the possible impact of these developments on the ongoing efforts to prepare for elections, which were delayed two years ago.
""All parties must preserve the security gains achieved in recent years and address differences through dialogue,"" its statement said.

Ukraine war: Ship leaves Odesa despite Russia Black Sea attack fears,"A merchant ship has left the Ukrainian port of Odesa, despite concerns Russia could target vessels in the Black Sea.
The Hong Kong-flagged Joseph Schulte had been trapped in the port since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 
Kyiv has announced a ""humanitarian corridor"" in the Black Sea after a deal collapsed last month which had allowed it to export grain.
But Moscow has not said whether it will respect the corridor. 
The ship left as Kyiv said Russian air strikes damaged grain storage facilities in Reni, a river port on the Danube river, about 260km (160 miles) south west of Odesa.
Ukrainian officials released photos showing destroyed storage facilities and piles of scattered grain and sunflowers in Reni, on Ukraine's border with Moldova and Romania. 
An industry source told Reuters the port was continuing operations. 
Russia has not commented on the latest attack.
Last month Russia pulled out of a deal guaranteeing safe passage for exports across the Black Sea, and said any ship heading for Ukrainian ports could be considered a military target.
Earlier this week it fired warning shots at a ship travelling towards Ukraine. 
Ukraine is a major grain and oilseeds exporter, and the blockade has contributed to rising food prices globally.

Despite the threats, Ukraine last week announced a humanitarian corridor in the Black Sea to allow ships to leave its ports, promising full transparency to make clear they were serving no military purpose. 
""A first vessel used the temporary corridor for merchant ships to/from the ports of Great Odesa,"" Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Facebook. 
Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, which jointly owns the Joseph Schulte with a Chinese bank, confirmed the ship was travelling to Istanbul, Turkey, Reuters reports. 
It was carrying more than 30,000 tonnes of cargo, including food, in 2,114 containers, Mr Kubrakov said, adding that the corridor would mainly be used to evacuate ships trapped in Black Sea ports since Russia's full-scale invasion began. 
Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials announced the capture of Urozhaine, a small hamlet in the eastern Donetsk region, from Russian forces. 
""Urozhaine liberated - our defenders are entrenched at the outskirts,"" Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram. 
In recent months, Ukrainian forces have been conducting a huge counter-offensive, largely in the east and south east, aimed at retaking territory from occupying Russian forces. 
Despite receiving billions of dollars of Western military equipment, it has seen only modest advances. 
Earlier this week Ukraine said it had recaptured 3 sq km (1.2 sq miles) of territory around war-ravaged Bakhmut, also in Donetsk region, although it is facing ""powerful resistance"" in the south. 
Intense fighting in the country's east has led to many residents being evacuated.
As she prepared to leave the frontline town of Kupiansk, in Kharkiv Region, Vira Vunesku, 53, said she was ill and needed to evacuate her grandson. 
""My condition is serious - I was in a hospital in Kharkiv, came back home for a bit, and now I have to leave again,"" she told AFP news agency. 
Separately, Russia said its air defence systems downed three drones overnight near Moscow, the latest in a series of attacks that have targeted Russian cities.

Sara Sharif: Trio known to Woking girl booked flights to Pakistan,"Three people known to 10-year-old Sara Sharif booked one-way tickets to Pakistan, and flew the day before her body was found, BBC News understands.
Sara's body was found at her home in Woking, Surrey, on 10 August.
The BBC has spoken to a travel agent in the town who said he was contacted by someone known to Sara, wanting tickets for three adults and five children.
Police want to speak to three people known to Sara - who they have not named - and who left the UK on 9 August.
Surrey Police launched a murder investigation after Sara's body was found alone in the family home 02:50 BST.
Speaking to the BBC, the travel agent in Woking identified the person making the booking on the evening of 8 August to travel the following day, whom he said had used his services before.
The BBC has spoken to police in Pakistan who have said that no formal approach has been made by the British authorities over the case.
Pakistan and the UK do not have a formal extradition treaty.
In an interview with the Sun newspaper Sara's mother spoke about her grief and disbelief that her daughter was dead.
Olga Sharif was divorced from Sara's father, who had custody of the child. 
A post-mortem examination was due to be carried out yesterday (Tuesday) on the 10-year-old but a cause of death has not been formally confirmed.

Military airlifts hundreds to safety from fires in Northwest Territories,"Michel Labine, a long-time resident of Fort Smith in Canada's Northwest Territories, has often been the one fighting wildfires or helping evacuees in his hometown.
But last weekend, the 63-year-old found himself for the first time on the other side, forced to flee as a nearby forest fire inched closer and closer to his community.
The sky was smoky that Saturday morning but had turned pitch black by noon from the fires. 
""Then it broke up a bit and there was just a red, amber sky,"" Mr Labine told the BBC. That is when he saw fire trucks driving from home to home warning people to get out. 
Mr Labine and his family were later airlifted by the military 365km (226 miles) away to Fort McMurray, Alberta. The airlift is the biggest rescue operation in the territory's history. 
The Labines managed to get out with only the essentials. 
""We had no luggage,"" Mr Labine said. ""I had my bag with my medical items and that was it. We had nothing.""
He is one of more than 6,500 people who have been ordered to evacuate in parts of the Northwest Territories due to 236 active wildfires in the region. 
On Tuesday, the government declared a territory-wide state of emergency, while the mayor in the small town of Hay River warned people in her community that time to escape is running out.
""It is life-threatening to be here,"" Kandis Jameson said at a news conference, adding the fire is about 15 kilometres from the town. Ms Jameson said about 500 people have yet to evacuate. 
This is Hay River's second evacuation this summer. The town also housed evacuees from Fort Smith, who were forced to flee again on Sunday.
""When they evacuated Hay River, there were over 5,000 people there,"" Mr Labine said. ""Normally there would be 3,500, but they had a lot of people from Fort Smith.""
One of those fires has destroyed nearly all of the hamlet of Enterprise, its mayor said on Tuesday, which is home to 120 people.
""I think there's seven or eight houses left and three or four businesses,"" Michael St Amour told the CBC. ""Between 85 and 90% of the community is gone."" 
Another fire is within one mile of Fort Smith, Mr Labine said. 
""If the wind is in our favour then we might be saved,"" he said. ""But if the wind shifts to the south … the town's gone."" 
""All we can do is pray now, and hope that the guy upstairs says 'we're going to let you go this year,'"" said Mr Labine, who is now sheltering at a hotel full with other evacuees.
Canada is witnessing its worst wildfire season on record, with nearly 1,100 active fires across the country as of Tuesday, thanks to a drier than normal summer. 
A total of 13.2m hectares (32.6m acres) have burned so far - roughly the size of Greece.
The Canadian government has deployed its military to the Northwest Territories to help fight the fires and coordinate evacuations.
Meanwhile, Yellowknife - the territorial capital - declared a local state of emergency on Monday night due to the ""imminent threat"" of wildfires. The declaration allows the city to take pre-emptive steps to respond and to prepare residents to leave at a moment's notice. 
A retired renewable resources officer whose role included dispatching fire crews in his community, Mr Labine said this year's wildfire season is unlike any other he has witnessed. 
The ground has been so dry this summer that walking on grass felt like stepping on broken glass, he said. 
""When you stepped on it, it just crunched,"" Mr Labine said. ""I've never seen it that dry. We've had very little rain."" 
The Northwest Territories saw its hottest temperature on record this July, reaching 37.4C in the northern community of Fort Good Hope. 
Wildfires are also burning in British Columbia, where several heat warnings are in effect this week due to record-high temperatures. 
Scientists say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. 
Extreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation.
The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

Secret room found in County Wexford Castle,"The original castle dates back over 850 years
At a glance
The secret room was discovered during conservation works at Johnstown Castle on Sunday 
Contractors broke through a section of wall to find an untouched room
The Irish Heritage Trust wants to find out more about what it was used for, when and who by
The gothic-revival castle outside Wexford town has been undergoing substantial conservation and restoration works in recent years
A secret room has been discovered during conservation works at a castle in County Wexford.
The discovery was made at Johnstown Castle on Sunday by a carpenter who was working on window.
The contractors from National Gates and Joinery Company broke through a section of wall only to uncover a hidden room which had remained untouched for many years.
It will now be assessed by the Irish Heritage Trust to find out more about what it was used for, when and who by.
The contractors from National Gates and Joinery Company uncovered the room
The gothic-revival castle outside Wexford town has been undergoing substantial conservation and restoration works in recent years and has been reopening to the public in stages.
The original castle on the site dates back more than 850 years to Norman times.
It was owned by a number of different aristocratic families before entering public ownership in the late 20th century.
Parts of the castle were opened to the public for the first time in mid-2019 and more followed during the past two years, following a €7.5 million makeover.
Anne O'Donoghue, CEO of the Irish Heritage Trust, said it was an incredible discovery.
""It is highly unusual to find additional hidden treasures in heritage properties and this is the second time that this has happened at Johnstown Castle following our discovery of a secret room under the tower at the lake just last year,"" she said.
The room found under the tower is only accessible by boat.
Manager of Johnstown Castle, Brenda Comerford, said the room appeared to have been covered up for a long time.
""It is part of one of the towers and looking around it, on initial inspection we think it was most likely a small turret bedroom. 
""There is quite a tragic family history associated with Johnstown Castle, so this room could have been sealed off due to a tragedy, which would have happened in times past, who knows. 
""We will need to investigate this further.”

Russia's new tactic for cutting off Ukraine's grain,"Following the Kremlin's refusal to renew the deal which allowed ships to transport grain across the Black Sea, Russia has started targeting Ukraine's key alternative export routes along the Danube River. 
We've looked at what grain infrastructure has been targeted and what this latest escalation means for global trade.
Since it started in August 2022, almost 33 million tonnes of grain and other foodstuffs have been exported via the Black Sea grain deal.
But with Ukraine's Black Sea ports now effectively blockaded by Russia, experts say it will have to rely heavily on its ports along the Danube river to export grain into neighbouring Romania.
From there it can be transported further afield as Romania's ports remain open.
After repeatedly targeting export hubs on the Black Sea, Russia has now turned its missiles and drones on ports on the Danube.
Russia's has attacked the port of Reni twice, with missiles and drones striking about 200m from the border with Romania - which is a Nato member - across the Danube.
In the Black Sea, extensive damage to port infrastructure was seen in Chornomorsk, where at least two storage tanks appear to have been hit on the night of 19 July.
Ukrainian authorities say that 60,000 tons of agricultural products were destroyed at the site.
The main grain terminal at Odesa port appears to have remained unscathed on satellite images we've analysed.
There have been several recent attacks on the city of Odesa, but these other strikes don't seem to have disrupted grain trade.
Further south, in areas where Ukraine uses other export routes that bypass the Black Sea, the damage has been more extensive.
A total of 19 drone attacks on Danube ports were recorded on the night of 24 July, hitting Ukraine's main alternative export routes, according to Lloyd's List - a company that tracks global shipping markets.
Russia's attacks on Reni have caused extensive damage.
From satellite imagery we can see the strikes hit several silos, hangars and other buildings at the port.
On 2 August, Russian drones targeted the port of Izmail on the Danube, according to a local official.
He said they hit grain storage and loading infrastructure, a passenger building and the offices of a private shipping company. 
The Zatoka bridge - a key link which allows grain trucks into Izmail - has also reportedly been hit.
""With the grain deal being over, the export of Ukrainian grain will stumble at maximum export capacity by river, trucks and rail to about 2.5 million tonnes per month,"" says Mariia Bogonos, an agriculture policy expert at the Kyiv School of Economics.
The majority of this would travel via the Danube river.
""Prior to the war Odesa was the biggest grain exporter, but in recent months because of slow operations in Odesa, the Danube has become the main route,"" says Andrey Sizov, an expert on the Black Sea agricultural markets.
Although the recent attacks temporarily closed the port of Reni, all the Danube ports appear to have swiftly returned to normal operations. 
The strikes have failed to significantly affect trade along the river route, according to Lloyds List.
Any further disruption has an impact on the rest of Europe and the world - as global wheat prices will increase if there's a hold up in trade.
Prices of wheat are up more than 10% since the deal enabling grain shipments to safely leave Black Sea ports collapsed.
Dozens of commercial ships are currently sailing in the Danube and waiting by the river's mouth, according to vessel tracking data from Lloyd's List.
There's been speculation that this week's strikes have caused a backlog, but Richard Meade, Editor-in-Chief of Lloyd's List, says they've just exacerbated the congestion that's been there since the start of the war.
""Without the [Black Sea grain deal], exports are heading to the south but there is a physical limitation on how many ships you can get through a narrow river corridor,"" says Mr Meade. 
Moscow and Kyiv have both threatened to treat some commercial vessels as military targets, which has added to tensions in the shipping industry.
Mr Meade believes it's unlikely that either side will attack commercial ships, but even the threat of this will stop many boats from returning to the region - and those that do come back will face higher insurance premiums.
Lloyd's List say the increased risk at Danube ports has left traders assessing the viability of remaining Ukraine grain export routes.
There are land routes where grain could be taken by truck or rail, but agriculture experts say this wouldn't be quick or cheap to facilitate.
""The reason it's taken in large quantities by boat is that its the lowest cost of transporting it, so all the other routes will add costs to the grain and the price will increase,"" says Mike Lee, an agriculture expert who focuses on eastern Europe.
Mr Lee also says Russia could target those overland routes next.
""If they are hell-bent on stopping grain exports out of Ukraine then will they start to attack the rail infrastructure, they haven't yet but the logical next step is the railways,"" he says.

Alec Baldwin: How events unfolded after fatal Rust shooting,"Actor and producer Alec Baldwin is no longer facing charges of involuntary manslaughter, after criminal charges against him were dropped over a fatal on-set shooting.
Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed by a live bullet fired from a prop gun being used by Baldwin, on the set of the film Rust in 2021. 
Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film's armourer responsible for safety on the set, is still facing two counts of involuntary manslaughter.
She is fighting the charges in Santa Fe Magistrates Court, New Mexico, and there will be a preliminary hearing on 3 May. 
Here is a summary of the events so far.
Halyna Hutchins dies and director Joel Souza is injured after Alec Baldwin fires a prop gun on a film set for 19th Century western Rust in New Mexico.
Ukrainian-born Hutchins was shot while working as the film's director of photography. The 42-year-old was flown to hospital by helicopter, but died of her injuries. Souza was taken by ambulance from the scene at Bonanza Creek Ranch.
Baldwin, who is also a co-producer of Rust, plays the film's lead and namesake - an outlaw whose 13-year-old grandson is convicted of manslaughter. The actor, 64, is best-known as Jack Donaghy on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock, and for his portrayal of Donald Trump on sketch show Saturday Night Live.
Speaking at the time, he said: ""My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna."" He said he was ""fully co-operating with the police investigation"".
In his first statement since the on-set shooting, injured director Souza says he is ""gutted by the loss of my friend and colleague"" Hutchins.
Hutchins was fatally shot in the chest. Souza, who had been standing behind her, was treated in hospital for a wound to the shoulder, and later discharged.
Court submissions show assistant director David Halls did not know the gun contained live ammunition, and indicated it was unloaded by shouting ""cold gun!""
A vigil takes place in New Mexico to mourn Hutchins, with industry professionals among those lighting candles in her memory.
Legal documents reveal Alec Baldwin was drawing a revolver across his body and pointing it at a camera during the on-set rehearsal when the gun fired.
It is revealed Rust's assistant director, David Halls, had been sacked from a previous production, war drama Freedom's Path, over gun safety violations in 2019.
A statement from the producers of that film told news agency AFP that Halls was dismissed after a crew member ""incurred a minor and temporary injury when a gun was unexpectedly discharged"".
Halls could not be reached for comment. There is no suggestion that he was at fault for the Rust incident.
Criminal charges may still be filed over the shooting on the set of Rust, police say, a week after the tragedy.
Investigators said a ""lead projectile"" had been removed from director Souza's shoulder, and that it appeared to be a live round.
Sante Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said police had recovered 600 pieces of evidence so far - including three firearms and 500 rounds of ammunition.
Baldwin speaks publicly for the first time since the shooting, calling Hutchins ""my friend"".
""The day I arrived in Santa Fe and started shooting I took her [Hutchins] to dinner with Joel,"" he said. ""We were a very, very well-oiled crew shooting a film together, and then this horrible event happened.""
He said police had ordered him not to discuss the ongoing investigation, but described the accident as a ""one-in-a-trillion episode"".
He tells reporters he would be in favour of limiting the future use of firearms on film productions to protect people's safety.
A legal action against Alec Baldwin alleges that the film script did not require him to fire a gun when he fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.
Script supervisor Mamie Mitchell - who called police after the shooting on the New Mexico film set - filed the case.
Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, accused the actor of ""playing Russian roulette"" when he fired the gun without checking it first.
Police obtain a further warrant to search the premises of an arms supplier.
An affidavit - a written statement of evidence - with the warrant says police were told ammunition for the film had come from several sources, including PDQ Arm & Prop.
The affidavit said the ammunition supplier's owner, Seth Kenney, had told investigators the live round may have been from some ""reloaded ammunition"".
He said the ammunition he supplied for the film consisted of dummy rounds and blanks, according to the affidavit.
Baldwin admits his acting career may be over, telling George Stephanopoulos of ABC News: ""It could be"", adding that he did not care.
He also says he ""didn't pull the trigger"" of the gun during the incident, and adds: ""Someone put a live bullet in a gun. I know it's not me.""
Baldwin said that, while he didn't feel guilty, the incident had left him emotionally scarred.
According to court records, Halls was given the gun by Gutierrez-Reed. Her lawyers have said she did not know where ""the live rounds came from"". That question lies at the centre of the police investigation.
Police obtain a search warrant for Baldwin's phone, issued by a Sante Fe court. The warrant claims ""there may be evidence on the phone"" that could be ""material and relevant to this investigation"".
Investigators move to confiscate Baldwin's iPhone to look at text messages, emails, web browser history and other information.
Despite obtaining a search warrant more than three weeks earlier, in December, officials say they have been unable to obtain Baldwin's phone.
The actor hits back at suggestions he is not complying with the investigation.
In a long video message posted to his Instagram page, the actor says ""any suggestion"" he had been deliberately evasive with investigators was a ""lie"".
""They can't just go through your phone and take your photos, or your love letters to your wife, or what have you,"" Mr Baldwin said. ""That is a process that takes time. But of course we are going to comply 1000% with all that.""
Gutierrez-Reed sues the prop supplier, alleging his company distributed ""a mix of dummy and live ammunition"" on set.
She filed her legal claim in New Mexico state court, and is seeking unspecified damages from Seth Kenney and PDQ Arm and Prop LLC. Kenney has not yet commented.
Her claim states: ""The ammunition was misrepresented as only dummy ammunition when it contained both dummy and live ammunition.""
But in December, Kenney had told Good Morning America: ""It's not possible that they [the live rounds] came from PDQ or myself personally.""
Court documents state Gutierrez-Reed said police discovered seven bullets suspected of being live after the shooting, according to AFP news agency. 
The documents said the bullets were distributed among a box of cartridges with other ammunition and cartridge belts, intended for the actors to use as accessories.
Baldwin turns over his mobile phone to police investigating the fatal shooting.
Hutchins' family brings a lawsuit against Baldwin, assistant director Halls, armourer Gutierrez-Reed and prop master Sarah Zachry. 
It alleges Baldwin ""recklessly shot and killed"" cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust in October 2021.
Lawyers for the Hutchins' family say she would still be alive if crew members had not cut corners.
The case was filed in the First Judicial District Court of New Mexico on behalf of the cinematographer's husband, Matthew, and son Andros, and seeks unspecified damages.
Hutchins' husband says it is ""absurd"" that Baldwin is not taking responsibility for her death.
Matthew Hutchins tells NBC's Today: ""I was angry to see him talk about her death so publicly in such a detailed way, and then to not accept responsibility after having just described killing her.""

The producers of Rust are fined and strongly criticised by authorities for failing to follow safety guidelines.
The makers of the film showed ""plain indifference to recognised hazards associated with use of firearms on set"", according to the New Mexico Environment Department.
The agency issues the maximum $136,793 (£105,000) fine to Rust Movie Productions.
Police release footage from the set of Rust, including of the aftermath of the fatal shooting.
Santa Fe Sheriff Adan Mendoza also releases crime scene photos and witness interviews with people including Baldwin. 
The producers of Rust dispute an official report saying they were indifferent to gun safety before the on-set shooting tragedy.
Rust Movie Productions says it ""enforced all applicable safety protocols"".
In legal documents filed to contest the official findings, the firm also said it ""did not 'wilfully' violate any safety protocol"".
Baldwin reaches a settlement with Hutchins' family.
Filming of Rust will continue in January 2023, with her widower Matthew on board as the movie's executive producer.
All parties believe Hutchins' death was an accident, her husband said.
The exact terms of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, are not disclosed.
Heather Brewer, spokesperson for the office of the first judicial district attorney for New Mexico, said the proposed settlement ""will have no impact on District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altweis' ongoing investigation, or her ultimate decision whether to file criminal charges in the case"".
Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed will each will be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter over the shooting of Halyna Hutchins, District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies announces. 
Lawyers for both say they intend to fight the charges in court.
Both face up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 (£4,040) fine if convicted. They will be tried by a jury, prosecutors say.
Assistant director David Halls entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanour charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, prosecutors said. He will spend six months serving probation.
Baldwin was on the phone during firearms training for Rust, prosecutors say, as they charge him with involuntary manslaughter.
Santa Fe's District Attorney's Office accuse the actor of ""many instances of extremely reckless acts"".
""If Mr Baldwin had performed mandatory safety checks with armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and not pointed the gun at Hutchins, the ""tragedy would not have occurred"", wrote Robert Shilling. He is a special investigator for the district attorney's office, and wrote this in a statement of probable cause filed with the manslaughter charges.
Baldwin has previously denied responsibility for the shooting and a representative declined to comment to the BBC. 
A lawyer for Gutierrez-Reed says she ""will fight these charges"" and blamed Halls for not letting her know that a real gun was to be used in the moment when the fatal shooting occurred.
Hutchins' family files a new civil suit against Alec Baldwin and producers involved in Rust.
Their lawyer, Gloria Allred, says they were ""devastated by the shocking killing"" and ""feel strongly that anyone who is responsible for her loss must be held accountable"".
The case alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence, and is being brought in Los Angeles County Superior Court by Hutchins' mother, father and sister, who are living in Ukraine.
Filming on Rust is to resume this spring, according to US reports, with Baldwin remaining in the the starring role. It is shifting location to Montana.
A mix of new and old crew members will work on the film, with Bianca Cline taking over as cinematographer. 
Meanwhile Hutchins' widower Matthew has also approved a documentary about his late wife, producers said.
The documentary, made ""at [executive producer, Mr] Hutchins' behest, and with his blessing and support"" will explore Ms Hutchins' life and ""final work, including the completion of the film"", a statement said.
Rust Movie productions, which Baldwin is part of, have said that the scene which was being rehearsed when Ms Hutchins was shot has now been rewritten, and that the ""any use of working weapons and any form of ammunition"" had been barred from the set.
Prosecutors in New Mexico drop firearm enhancement charges against Baldwin, in a move which reduces possible prison time for the actor, as the charges carry a mandatory five-year prison sentence.
He still faces up to 18 months in prison under involuntary manslaughter charges.
Heather Brewer, Santa Fe county district attorney spokesperson, said the prosecution dropped the firearm enhancement charge to ""avoid further litigious distractions by Mr Baldwin and his attorneys"".
According to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, prosecutors also dropped the firearm enhancement charge for Gutierrez-Reed.
Lawyers for Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed had been arguing against the firearm enhancement charge, saying prosecutors were applying a version of the law passed after the October 2021 shooting accident.
Baldwin pleads not guilty to involuntary manslaughter for the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins on the set of Rust.
He entered his plea online and also waived his right to an upcoming virtual court hearing.
Gutierrez-Reed is also accused of involuntary manslaughter; prosecutors say she failed to ensure that dummy bullets were loaded into the gun that killed Hutchins.
Criminal charges are dropped against Alec Baldwin over the fatal on-set shooting.
A statement, released by New Mexico special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason Lewis, said that ""over the last few days... new facts were revealed"" in the case, requiring further investigation.
""This decision does not absolve Mr Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled,"" the statement continued, adding: ""Our follow-up investigation will remain active and ongoing.""
A lawyer for Mr Baldwin praised the move by prosecutors, saying: ""We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident."" 
The film's armourer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is still facing two counts of involuntary manslaughter, and there will be a preliminary hearing on 3 May.
On the same day, filming and principal photography for Rust resumed in Montana.
The family of Halyna Hutchins said they will sue Alec Baldwin despite his criminal charges being dropped. 
A lawyer for Ms Hutchins' parents and sister said that the actor ""cannot escape responsibility"" for her death. 
Mr Baldwin had already reached a deal with her widower and 10-year-old son.
A judge approved a settlement agreement for the family of Halyna Hutchins.
Lawyers representing Ms Hutchins' husband Matthew and their son Andros sued Baldwin and the film's other producers for wrongful death in 2022.
An undisclosed settlement was agreed later the same year.
On Thursday, US judge Bryan Biedscheid approved that agreement, which will see youngster Andros receive ""periodic payments"" when he reaches the ages of 18 and 22.
The order stated that the settlement was ""fair, appropriate, and in the best interests of Andros Hutchins, a minor, protected person"".
Matthew Hutchins, as part of the settlement, will also become an executive producer on Rust - the western film which recently resumed filming in Montana.
A weapons supervisor on the set of Alec Baldwin's film Rust was likely hungover on the day a cinematographer was fatally shot, prosecutors alleged.
They accused Hannah Gutierrez-Reed of drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana in the evenings during filming.
In response, her lawyer said prosecutors had mishandled the case and resorted to ""character assassination"".
Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armourer and weapons supervisor on Rust pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering charges.
Prosecutors say Ms Gutierrez-Reed acted recklessly when loading the gun.
They said she failed to ensure that dummy bullets were loaded into the weapon that killed Ms Hutchins, and that the armourer handed the gun to Baldwin, having not checked that all the bullets were dummies.
Ms Gutierrez-Reed denies this. 
A new report appeared to cast doubt over Mr Baldwin's accounts of events.
He repeatedly denied pulling the trigger of the prop gun which went off, killing Ms Hutchins.
But weapons experts said the trigger would have ""had to be pulled"".

AI and data labelling: 'I felt like my life ended',"This video can not be played
Have you ever used ChatGPT before?
The software - which mimics human-like conversational dialogue in response to search queries - is powered by artificial intelligence.
But we all know the internet isn't always the safest place.
Now, a group of Kenyan 'data labellers' tasked with creating safety filters for a well-known chatbot are calling for more to be done to ensure they're protected from what they have to see online.
Mophat told the BBC's Anita Nkonge how his AI-related job has affected his personal life.

Bindeshwar Pathak: India's 'Toilet Man' who made urinating safely a reality,"Campaigner and social reformer Bindeshwar Pathak who died on Tuesday, aged 80, was a man who revolutionised the concept of toilets in India.
In the early 1970s, he made a cheap twin-pit toilet - a design which has since been used to build clean toilets in hundreds of thousands of homes across India, helping millions of women access safe sanitation facilities.
Over the years, his Sulabh Foundation also helped many Indian cities set up pay-per-use toilets that were clean and safe.
The concept - one rupee for a pee and two rupees for a poo - quickly caught on in a country where using a toilet in public often meant squatting behind a tree. 
His work in challenging India's tenacious caste discrimination - which puts those at the bottom of the social hierarchy at a disadvantage - and uplifting manual scavengers, mostly Dalits (formerly untouchables), has also been widely recognised.
During his lifetime, Mr Pathak won many prestigious Indian and global awards. As his popularity grew, the press dubbed him ""Mr Sanitation"" and ""The Toilet Man of India"". In a report, the Washington Post described him as a ""mini revolutionary"" and he figured in the Economist Global Diversity List in 2015. 
According to a New York Times report in 1989, he once led 100 girls from families of manual scavengers in Rajasthan state into a temple - where Dalits were traditionally barred from entering - and ate a meal in public with them. 
In recent years, the Sulabh Foundation also tied up with the Indian government's flagship Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign) which aims to end open defecation.
Mr Pathak, who often said that his ""priority in life was to solve the problem of sanitation for people"" and that ""I love this work more than my sons and daughters"", was deeply influenced by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, India's independence movement leader. 
Born in an upper-caste Brahmin family, Mr Pathak says that even as a child he was acutely aware of his privilege and confused by the unforgiving realities of the caste system, which dictated life in his village in every possible way. 
In an interview with the BBC in 2017, he narrated an incident from his childhood about a woman who brought deliveries to their home. After every visit, his grandmother would sprinkle water in the area to ""purify"" the house. ""I used to wonder why. People used to tell me that she was an untouchable and the land she walked on became polluted,"" he said.
A curious child, he would touch her surreptitiously to see if that would lead to any ""change in him"". One day, his grandmother caught him and there was ""an uproar"" in the house. 
""A priest was called in and told the family that Pathak had been contaminated and must be banished from home. That's when my mum intervened - he's just a boy, she said, there must be another solution."" 
It turned out that there was another so-called remedy, but it was ""equally terrible"". 
Mr Pathak said he was then forced to swallow cow dung and urine (cows are considered sacred by Hindus) - it was ""traumatic for me"", he recalled. 
The incident was a turning point for Mr Pathak, a moment of reckoning when he realised the extent of the stigma around untouchability in those days.  
""I would obsess over why we lived in such an unfair society with different rules for different people,"" he said in the interview. ""You can touch a dog, but touching another human who's just like you causes a family crisis.""
Keenly aware of this social inequality, he studied sociology in college and do something about this.
In the summer of 1968, a newly married Mr Pathak spent three months in a Dalit colony.
This greatly upset his family and community - the Brahmins said they were disgusted by his behaviour, his father was unhappy and his father-in-law accused him of bringing shame to their culture.
""My father-in-law was so furious with me that he told me he never wanted to see my face again, and that he regretted letting his daughter marry a man like me,"" Mr Pathak told the BBC.
He said the outburst saddened him, but he never regretted his choices. ""I thought to myself, I could leave my wife but not my mission.""
In 1969, Mr Pathak made a breakthrough in his research and designed a twin-pit toilet that freed thousands of manual scavengers from a life of cleaning excrement with their hands. 
The government of Bihar commissioned him to build 200 of these, after which his idea became popular and lots of important people started coming to see him and seek his advice. 
All this attention also improved his family's opinion of his work.
""My wife had always supported me, but it was only now that my father-in-law started to think that I must be doing something right,"" he told the BBC.
The Sulabh Foundation has since built 1.5 million toilets that are used by more than 20 million people in India. The design is also used in many other parts of the world. 
And since 1974, Sulabh has built more than 9,000 ""pay-and-use"" toilets in urban slums and at public places such as bus stands, markets and railway stations across the country.
In a country where fly-ridden, smelly bathrooms are common, Mr Pathak's work is recognised as a great instance of public service.
He transformed the lives of millions of Indians, especially women, who earlier had no access to toilets in crowded public places and had to exercise bladder control for hours.
In his interview with the BBC, he said: ""Sanitation is my religion. If you have not helped another human being you have not prayed to God yet.""

Rugby volunteer takes Ukrainians under her wing,"A volunteer who has been working with Ukrainian refugees said the families were like ""rabbits in headlights"" when they first arrived.
Kym Bromley said she took Rugby's Ukrainian community under her wing by ""sheer accident"".
She had been helping out sending medical supplies out to Ukraine and offered to set up a pop-up shop for people arriving in Rugby.
Since then they have spent a good part of the last year together.
""Everything was free to anybody that came in,"" she said.
""There was shampoos, deodorant, clothes, make up even and that's where I met the group.
""They were like rabbits in headlights. Nobody was guiding them and I started seeing them regularly and helping them out with any questions they needed to ask.""
Kym gives up every Saturday to offer a place to meet others, socialise, and learn English.
She also organised a trip to the seaside for more than 50 mums and children that now live in Rugby. 
""After their journey from Ukraine, I just thought they just needed a day not thinking about anything,"" she said.
""It was just so nice seeing them relax, swim, it was a beautiful day.""
The group told her that while in Mablethorpe they did not think about the war ""even once"" and since then they had grown in confidence and have begun to organise events and activities for themselves.
The hardest thing being in Rugby is ""to be without a family"", said Iryna Vasylyshyn, president of Rugby Ukraine Community. She moved here in June last year and said meeting Kym had helped her stay positive.
""I know when I have a problem I can talk to Kym,"" she said.
Kym said she never thought she would be able to fall in love with a ""bunch of strangers"" who she now viewed as part of her family.
""Hopefully when the war is over I can go to their country and see them in their environment"", she said.
She has been shortlisted in the Volunteer category of BBC CWR Make a Difference Awards.

Hawaii wildfires: 'Directed energy weapon' and other false claims go viral,"False claims about the deadly wildfires in Hawaii - including that shadowy forces orchestrated the disaster with a laser beam - have gained traction online.
The misleading posts come from a variety of sources and accounts, but generally imply that ""elites"" or government agencies deliberately started the fires.
Some of the most popular theories are couched in questions about a ""narrative"" and make claims that alternative views are being ""censored"", despite collecting millions of views.
While there are specific rumours circulating about Maui, they fit into a general pattern repeatedly seen after extreme weather events and natural disasters -  politically motivated activists seeking to downplay the potential impact of climate change.
Videos and images claiming that the wildfires were not a natural disaster - and were instead caused by a ""directed energy weapon"", a ""laser beam"" or explosion - have been viewed millions of times.
One video viewed 10 million times claims to show a large explosion in Maui just before the fires.
But the video was originally a viral clip shared on TikTok in May showing a transformer explosion in Chile.
Chilean TV network Chilevisión ran a report on the viral video, confirming the explosion was the result of a blown transformer caused by strong wind.
An image of a church on fire in Hawaii has been viewed 9 million times, with claims it shows a laser beam striking it. 
But it has been digitally altered. The original image - of the Waiola Church in Lahaina in flames on 8 August - has no laser beam or ray of light visible.
Two other false images have been racking up huge numbers of views.
One shows a fireball and a bright streak of light rising up towards the night sky. It, too, has been accompanied by claims that wildfires are not a natural phenomenon. 
But a search on the internet for previous versions of this image reveals the photo shows a controlled burn at an Ohio oil refinery and was first posted online in January 2018. The streak of light, known as a ""light pillar"", is an optical illusion formed by reflections off ice crystals on a cold day.
A similar image claims to show a huge beam of light in Maui just before the wildfires. But it shows the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in California in May 2018.
There are claims circulating about videos from Maui showing some trees still standing while houses and vehicles have been burned, with people pointing to the pictures as ""evidence"" that the fires were deliberately set or that their real cause is being hidden from the public.
One post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, includes a video of the destruction and the message: ""Everything is burnt but the trees, but don't point that out or you're a conspiracy theorist."" 
That post - which has been seen more than 24 million times - has been challenged by X's Community Notes feature, where users add context and facts around viral content. 
Dr Rory Hadden, senior lecturer and expert in fire investigations at the University of Edinburgh, told BBC Verify that it is common for trees to remain standing even after severe wildfires because ""burning through a large piece of wood takes a long time"", ""thick pieces of wood are usually not able to sustain burning on their own"" and ""the high moisture content of trees will also make them hard to burn"".
Some plants, known as pyrophytes, have also adapted to survive wildfires due to thermal insulation or other means.
Alongside the ""directed energy weapon"" rumours, speculation spread in viral posts that some of the island's rich inhabitants and second-home owners deliberately started the wildfires to grab valuable land in Lahaina.
One viral video includes claims by a podcaster that native landowners in Maui have refused to sell land to investment management companies and rich locals. He notes the false ""directed energy weapon"" rumours before going on to speculate that there might be something to them because news outlets have called the rumours ""conspiracy theories"".
Another viral thread was seen 10 million times on an X account that frequently spreads false information debunked by Community Notes. It includes a list of wealthy people who purportedly own property on Maui, a video including aerial footage of Lahaina, and claims that the pattern of destruction is suspicious.
The cause or causes of the fires on Maui are still unknown, but no real evidence has emerged to suggest they were deliberately started as part of a land grab.
X had not responded to a request for comment as of Monday (14 August).

The Killers apologise for offending fans in Georgia with Russian 'brother' remark,"The Killers have apologised after frontman Brandon Flowers invited a Russian fan on stage during a concert in Georgia to play drums on a song.
He told the crowd to treat the Russian fan as their ""brother"", drawing boos and walk-outs from parts of the arena.
Georgia, which gained independence in 1991, has a long history of tension with its neighbour.
Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and still occupies part of the former Soviet state.
Tensions have been exacerbated after a number of Russians emigrated to Georgia following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. 
In a statement posted on social media after the concert, the Killers said: ""Good people of Georgia, it was never our intention to offend anyone!
""We have a longstanding tradition of inviting people to play drums and it seemed from the stage that the initial response from the crowd indicated that they were okay with tonight's audience participation member coming onstage with us.
""We recognise that a comment, meant to suggest that all of the Killers' audience and fans are 'brothers and sisters,' could be misconstrued.
""We did not mean to upset anyone and we apologise. We stand with you and hope to return soon.""

The backlash from sections of the crowd occurred after Flowers - as is now tradition at their gigs - invited a fan up on stage to play drums with them on their track Reasons Unknown, towards the end of Tuesday's concert at the Black Sea Arena, close to the city of Batumi.
""We don't know the etiquette of this land but this guy's a Russian. You OK with a Russian coming up here?"" Flowers was heard asking the audience.
Fan footage recorded at the concert shows the crowd responded to his question with a mixture of boos and cheers.
The singer later addressed the issue, asking fans: ""You can't recognise if someone's your brother? He's not your brother?
""We all separate on the borders of our countries? Am I not your brother, being from America?""
Georgian public opinion on the ongoing war is overwhelmingly pro-Ukrainian.
Flowers urged fans to celebrate ""that we're here together"", before adding that he didn't want the event to ""turn ugly"". ""And I see you as my brothers and my sisters.""

Grace played drums with The Killers hours after finishing her final AS-level exam
The Killers, a Las Vegas rock band known for indie anthems such as Mr Brightside, will headline Reading and Leeds Festivals later this month.
Their frontman made a surprise appearance as a guest of Sir Elton John as he played his final ever UK gig closing out Glastonbury Festival last month.
Georgia gained independence in 1991, just before the Soviet Union dissolved.
Analysis by Sandro Gvindadze, BBC Monitoring
Speaking about ""brotherhood"" with Russia is a huge red flag in a small South Caucasus republic. This is mainly due to the memories of the Russian-Georgian war in 2008, as Russia has occupied 20% of Georgia's territory since.
""They [The Killers] came to Georgia without even realising what's going on and whom they are going to sing for,"" Ramaz Samkharadze tells the BBC. He owns a Radio Station Tbilisi FM, which has removed all of The Killers' songs from the air as ""a gesture of support"" to anyone offended.
Resident of Tbilisi, Mariam Chargazia, who attended the gig, says she was angry at Flowers' remarks, as the band should have considered the anxiety most of Georgia's population is currently facing.
""This would have been OK in some other country, perhaps, but you are not supposed to come to Georgia saying that Georgians and Russians are brothers and sisters,"" she says.
The fears of new aggression, omnipresent in Georgian society since 2008, were exacerbated by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Especially after thousands of Russians fled to Georgia, escaping military draft. 
The majority of Georgians perceives this influx as a threat. According to a poll conducted in February by US organisation National Democratic Institute, 69% of the population fear that it might have a negative impact on the country.
Despite increasing calls, the ruling Georgian Dream party refused to introduce a visa regime for Russian citizens. Nevertheless, Russian opposition figures, journalists and civil activists are often denied entry to Georgia.
According to various public polls, over 80% of Georgians support joining the EU. In March 2022, Georgia applied for EU membership, together with Moldova and Ukraine, but unlike them, it didn't receive the EU candidate status.
After the start of the full-scale invasion, Georgian Dream also refused to impose economic sanctions against Russia, saying this would devastate Georgia's economy. Meanwhile, its leaders made numerous controversial statements accusing Ukraine, the EU and the US of ""trying to drag Georgia into the war"" with Russia.
Earlier this year, Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, praised Georgian Dream for ""the courage to say that it will be guided by its own interests"".
Interestingly, it was the Georgian Dream who invited The Killers to Georgia. On 22 November, Georgia's Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili announced that he would spend 70 million GEL (around $26m / £21m) in two years ""to bring international stars to the country"" to boost its international appeal.
""The government is spending our money wrong. While their rating is decreasing, they try to buy themselves popularity,"" Ramaz says.

'I celebrated my 10th birthday in Changi PoW camp',"The life of a prisoner in a Japanese World War Two camp was a meagre existence, but children in Singapore's notorious Changi prison managed to eke out a semblance of childhood. 
One of those was Olga Henderson, 91, who has been reunited with a quilt she made with her fellow child prisoners.
She was a guest at London's Imperial War Museum, where it is archived.
Mrs Henderson, now an Eastbourne resident, said she was proud to see it to mark VJ Day on Tuesday.
""It really was looking rather tatty when it was sent here,"" she said. ""It's [now] so polished and looked after. I can't believe it.""
In February 1942, Mrs Henderson lived in Johor Bahru, in British Malaya (modern day Malaysia), with her parents and three siblings when, along with Singapore, it was invaded by the Japanese.
A British Army officer arrived at the family's home to inform them that Japanese soldiers were 10 miles away and they were evacuated onto the island of Singapore.
However, the island refuge did not last for long as days later British forces there surrendered to Japan. 
Nine-year-old Olga Morris - as she was then known - and her family were forced to walk 17 miles without water to the centre of Singapore, then on to Changi and three years in captivity.
While the horrors of Changi were unrelenting, with forced labour, food shortages and inhumane living conditions, the adults tried to establish some sense of normality for the children. 
Mrs Henderson told the BBC that one of the adults, Mrs Ennis, had established a Guides group, which had to be kept secret from Japanese guards. 
""I don't know how she got away with it,"" she added. 
The children found space in the likes of the camp's carpenter shop to put on plays.
On Mrs Henderson's 10th birthday, she described how a woman called Mrs Mulvaney managed to get her a piece of blue satin for her dress and fashion a petticoat out of a rice bag.
""Everybody donated a bit of their cooked rice so we made a cake,"" she recalled. 
Asked what kept her and her family going through their time as inmates, Mrs Henderson said: ""We had so much work to do.""
Her mother cooked rice for the Japanese soldiers, while Mrs Henderson worked in the match factory and later dug trenches, she said.
Maria Castrillo, from the Imperial War Museum, said: ""My job involves connecting people with collections.
""Having this [quilt] is hugely significant. It is an object of huge cultural significance because it was made in very difficult conditions by young people, and it really shows the impact of war and conflict on younger people.""

Ecuador election: 'I'm wearing a bulletproof vest 24 hours a day',"Andrea González now wears a bulletproof vest 24 hours a day. 
A week ago, her Construye party's presidential candidate in the Ecuadorean election this Sunday, Fernando Villavicencio, was shot three times in the head after a campaign rally in the capital, Quito. 
Ms González, 36, will remain the party's candidate for vice-president, as the running mate of Christian Zurita. He is a journalist who has investigated corruption - as Fernando Villavicencio had.
""I'm not letting Fernando's legacy die,"" Ms González told the BBC's Newshour programme. 
""To me it's incredibly personal and hard to not be able to say goodbye to my friend. I'm wearing a bulletproof vest 24 hours [a day],"" she said. 
Mr Villavicencio, 59, a journalist and member of Ecuador's national assembly, was shot as he left a campaign rally in the capital last Wednesday - 11 days before the presidential election.
One attacker was killed in an exchange of fire with police, while several others escaped.
His death shocked a nation that has largely escaped the decades of drug-gang violence, cartel wars and corruption that has blighted many of its neighbours. Crime has, however, shot up in recent years, fuelled by the growth of Colombian and Mexican drug cartels.
Mr Villavicencio's campaign focused on corruption and gangs, and he was one of only a few candidates to allege links between organised crime and government officials in Ecuador.
""We are at the brink of becoming a narco state,"" Ms González said. 
""We are totally sure that this is a political assassination, more than the gangs and the organised crime. There's a political feeling in this, there's a political intention in this,"" she added.
""Three days before the debate and Fernando clearly said he had very delicate information that was going to change the way these elections were turning. That information never got to light.""

Ms González, whose career has mainly focused on environmental issues, said that these levels of violence had become normalised in Ecuadorean politics. 
Initially her party wanted her to succeed Mr Villavicencio as presidential candidate, but later party officials decided to keep her as running mate and chose Christian Zurita as the replacement. They feared she could have been disqualified, as she was already registered as vice-presidential candidate.
As the ballot papers had already been printed, Fernando Villavicencio's name will remain on the ballot.
Violence has not ceased since the attack on the candidate. Pedro Briones, a local leader of the left-wing Citizen Revolution Party in Esmeraldas, was shot dead by gunmen on a motorcycle at his home on Monday.
""Any one of us is exposed to this level of violence,"" Ms González said.
""Taking your child to school is already a high risk. Every time you stop at a traffic light you are exposed to getting shot or having a bomb next to your car. 
""The level of violence that Ecuador is experiencing has never been seen before.""
But she says this will not stop her attempts to achieve what her mentor had dreamed of.
""I feel a lot of weight on my shoulders,"" she said.

Travis King: North Korea says US soldier fled because of racism in army,"North Korea has said US soldier Travis King crossed into its territory last month because of ""inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination"" in the army.
The 23-year-old private dashed across the border from South Korea on 18 July while on a guided tour.
Private King admitted to crossing illegally and wanted refuge in the North, state news agency KCNA reported.
It is the first time Pyongyang has acknowledged detaining the soldier. The claims have not been verified.
They appeared in a statement which has so far only been published by the government-controlled KCNA. It did not provide further details about Private King's health or whether the country would accept him as a refugee.
Concerns have been growing for the welfare of the US soldier, who has not been heard from or seen since his crossing. 
The US is trying to negotiate Private King's release with the help of the UN Command, which runs the border area, and has a direct phoneline to the North Korean army.
Responding to the North Korean report on Wednesday, a Pentagon official said the US could not verify the claims and its priority was to have Private King brought home safely ""through all available channels"".
North Korea has given no information on how it plans to treat Private King but said the soldier admitted he had ""illegally"" entered the country. 
The fact that North Korea's statement emphasised Private King's illegal entry suggests that it is not thinking of having him stay even if he wants to, said Christopher Green, a senior consultant at the think-tank International Crisis Group.
""That is not surprising. He would lose all his political value to them if that were the case,"" said Mr Green, but added that North Korea is in no rush to negotiate Travis King's return to the US just yet. 
""They have very publicly thrown in their lot with Beijing and Moscow, as high-level delegation visits from both countries to Pyongyang in recent weeks show. It is a mistake to think that North Korea is or needs to be in a hurry to deal with the Travis King mess,"" he said. 
The statement on KCNA did not say if he would face prosecution or punishment, and there was no mention of his current whereabouts or condition. 
""During the investigation, Travis King confessed that he had decided to come over to the DPRK [North Korea] as he harboured ill feeling against inhuman maltreatment and racial discrimination within the US Army,"" KCNA reported.
""He also expressed his willingness to seek refuge in the DPRK or a third country, saying that he was disillusioned at the unequal American society.""

Watch: What's next for captured US soldier in North Korea?
Private King is a reconnaissance specialist who has been in the army since January 2021 and was in South Korea as part of his rotation.
Before crossing the border, he served two months in detention in South Korea for assault charges and was released on 10 July.
He was supposed to fly back to the US to face disciplinary proceedings but managed to leave the airport and join a tour of the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which separates North and South Korea.
The DMZ, one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world, is filled with landmines, surrounded by electric and barbed wire fencing, and monitored by surveillance cameras. Armed guards are supposed to be on alert 24 hours a day although witnesses say there were no North Korean soldiers present when Private King ran over.
His family have previously told US media that he had relayed experiencing racism in the army. They also said his mental health appeared to have declined after he spent time in a South Korean jail.
""It feels like I'm in a big nightmare,"" said his mother Claudine Gates, adding the family was desperate for answers. 
North Korea is one of the few countries still under nominally communist rule and has long been a highly secretive and isolated society. 
Its government, led by Kim Jong-un, also stands accused of systematic human rights abuse. 
Analysts say the detainment of Travis King has played into North Korea's anti-US messaging, at a time when relations between the two countries are their worst in years.
Pyongyang will most likely have relished the opportunity to highlight racism and other shortcomings in American society, especially given the international criticism it receives for human rights abuses.
The UN Security Council is due to hold a meeting on Thursday to discuss the human rights situation in North Korea for the first time since 2017.
Ahead of its comments on Travis King, North Korean media had put out a statement on the UN meeting, which will be led by the US.
""Not content with fostering racial discrimination and gun-related crimes, the US has imposed unethical human rights standards on other countries"", it read.

Ukrainian prisoners of war say they were tortured at Russian prison,"Former Ukrainian captives say they were subjected to torture, including frequent beatings and electric shocks, while in custody at a detention facility in south-western Russia, in what would be serious violations of international humanitarian law.  
In interviews with the BBC, a dozen ex-detainees released in prisoner exchanges alleged physical and psychological abuse by Russian officers and guards at the Pre-Trial Detention Facility Number Two, in the city of Taganrog.
The testimonies, gathered during a weeks-long investigation, describe a consistent pattern of extreme violence and ill-treatment at the facility, one of the locations where Ukrainian prisoners of war have been held in Russia. 
Their allegations include:
The BBC has been unable to independently verify the claims, but details of the accounts were shared with human rights groups and, when possible, corroborated by other detainees. 
The Russian government has not allowed any outside bodies, including the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, to visit the facility which before the war was used exclusively to hold Russian prisoners.
Russia's defence ministry did not respond to several requests to comment on the allegations. It has previously denied torturing or mistreating captives.
The prisoner swaps between Ukraine and Russia are a rare diplomatic achievement in the war and more than 2,500 Ukrainians have been released since the start of the conflict. Up to 10,000 captives are believed to remain in Russian custody, according to human rights groups. 
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's human rights ombudsman and one of the officials involved in exchange negotiations with Moscow, said nine in every 10 former detainees claimed they had been tortured while in Russian captivity. ""This is the biggest challenge for me now: how to protect our people on the Russian side,"" Lubinets said. ""Nobody knows how we can do it.""
Last September, Artem Seredniak, a senior lieutenant, had already been in Russian captivity for four months when he and about 50 other Ukrainians were transferred to Pre-Trial Detention Facility Number Two. They travelled in the back of a truck for hours, without knowing where they were going, blindfolded and tied to each other by their arms, like a ""human centipede"", Seredniak told me.
On their arrival in Taganrog, he recalled, an officer greeted them: ""Hello boys. Do you know where you are? You'll rot here until the end of your lives."" The captives remained silent. They were escorted inside the building, Seredniak said, had their fingerprints taken and clothes removed, were shaven and forced to shower. 
At every step, guards at the facility, who carried black batons and metal bars, beat them in the legs, arms, or ""anywhere they wanted"", Seredniak said. ""It's what they call 'reception'.""
Before his capture, Seredniak, who is 27, headed a sniper platoon at the Azov Regiment, the main military force in Mariupol. This, he said, made him a key target for the prison staff. Seredniak said he was separated from the others and, dressed only in his underwear, brought to a room to be interrogated for the first time. He was then pushed to the floor, he said, with his head facing down. 
The guards asked him about his role in the army and the tasks he had carried out. With an electric stun weapon, they gave him shocks, Seredniak said, in his back, groin and neck. 
""That's how they worked on everybody,"" he said. ""They hammered you like a nail.""
In May last year, as Mariupol was under a Russian siege, the Ukrainian authorities ordered hundreds of soldiers holed up in the city's Azovstal steelworks to surrender. Seredniak was among the last to be evacuated. He was first taken to a facility in Olenivka, a village in Donetsk, and, months later, sent to the prison in Taganrog, in the Russian border region of Rostov, about 120km (74 miles) east of Mariupol. 
There, he told me, the captives were inspected twice a day, and anything appeared to be a motive for guards to abuse them. ""They might not have liked how you left the cell, or you weren't quick to get out, or your arms were too low or your head was too high.""
In one of those checks, Seredniak was asked whether he had a girlfriend. He said he did, and recalled a guard telling him: ""Give us her Instagram. We'll take a picture of you and send it to her."" He lied, not wanting to expose her, and said she did not have an account. He was then beaten, he said, and brought to a room in the prison's basement, where he met a twenty-something Ukrainian fighter. Seredniak told me the man was curled, holding his hands, apparently in pain, and said officers had inserted needles under his fingernails. 
As the days progressed, Seredniak noticed that the prison guards were particularly brutal with those who belonged to the Azov Regiment, the former militia in Mariupol that once had links to the far right. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has said, among other things, that his war is an effort to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine - a country led by a Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelensky - and Russian authorities often cite the unit to justify the invasion.
Seredniak said that, in his interrogations, he was accused of looting Mariupol and of personally telling his forces to kill civilians in the city, the site of one of the most deadly battles in the war so far. Seredniak, who speaks fast with a loud, determined voice, denied the claims, but it did not seem to matter. ""Until you said what they were interested in, and in the way they wanted to hear,"" he told me, ""they wouldn't stop beating you.""
Once, Seredniak said, an officer used a wooden chair to hit him, and ""he beat me so much that it broke in parts"". On another day, he said, he was asked whether he could sing the ""Azov anthem"". He did not know of any Azov anthem, and assumed the guards meant the Prayer of the Ukrainian Nationalist, a 20th-Century oath usually read aloud by soldiers before being sent into combat. Seredniak reluctantly recited it, conscious of how the guards could react. 
They punched him several times, he said. He fell, hitting his head against a wall, causing a cut near his eyebrow. He lay on the floor, while the beatings continued, he said, all over his body.
""When I finally got up,"" Seredniak recalled, ""they told me: 'We hope we beat that out of you'.""
Some of the prison staff seemed to have been heavily influenced by President Putin's ""de-Nazification"" narrative. For the detainees, this was apparent in how the guards demonstrated a particular interest in anything that could, in their view, be interpreted as being pro-Nazi. The captives were not allowed to have any personal items, so their tattoos inevitably drew the officers' attention. This reminded me of similar allegations I heard while investigating Russia's filtration camps in occupied areas of Ukraine last year.
Serhii Rotchuk, a 34-year-old senior sergeant at the regiment, also left Azovstal in the final convoys, and was taken to Taganrog a week after Seredniak. He said the guards, at first, ""looked for swastikas or things like that"". But, in reality, he said, ""if you had any tattoo, you were seen as a bad guy"". Rotchuk, who is a doctor, has tattoos on both legs, arms and chest. Weeks ago, when we met in Kyiv, he lifted his T-shirt to show me a raven that covered part of his chest and the symbol of an infantry platoon on his left bicep; he also had an emblem of the Jedi Order from Star Wars on his left thigh. 
""Did these tattoos cause you any trouble?"" I asked him. ""Many times,"" Rotchuk replied. ""They would say: 'What's this? Oh, I'll beat you for that'."" Seredniak, who has no tattoos, said some fighters who had tattooed nationalist symbols, like the Ukrainian flag or the gold trident, were frequently targeted. ""They hated us for being Ukrainian,"" he told me.
In March, a report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said Russia had ""failed to ensure the humane treatment"" of prisoners, with  ""strong patterns of violations"". 
Kris Janowski, a  spokesman for the office, said there was a ""long list of bad things that have been done"" to the detainees at the facility in Taganrog. The fact that a prison was being used to hold captives was, in itself, a breach of international humanitarian law, he said, as they should be kept in specially designated places. Ukraine also faced some accusations of mistreatment of detainees, according to the March report; but, overall, they were ""treated in better fashion"".
Rotchuk said the captives ""lived in permanent stress"" in Taganrog. He recalled meeting a man, also a doctor, who had falsely admitted to removing the testicles of a Russian prisoner, desperate to put an end to the violence. ""He said: 'OK, just leave me alone, I will sign the confession.' The officers then intimidated the other medics, saying: 'Ah, you helped him.'""
Guards gave Rotchuk electric shocks, he said, but he resisted. Rotchuk told me he was sent to solitary confinement for two months as punishment. The beatings happened almost every day; sometimes, several times a day, he said. 
Rotchuk remembered one officer who appeared to take pleasure in kicking him in the chest, which left him with a persistent pain. He complained, but was given no help. ""I had to tell myself: 'Dude, stay strong, you can't control the situation, so you need to accept it,'"" Rotchuk recalled.
Not everyone had the same resilience, though. Seredniak said a fellow Azov fighter, in his late 20s, broke a small mirror that hung above his cell's sink, and used a shard to slice his throat. The man was rescued by other captives, who stopped the bleeding with their hands. Days later, Seredniak said, the prison staff removed the mirrors from all cells.
Russian doctors, Seredniak said, would occasionally visit the detainees, but ""didn't necessarily help"" them. He described the food portions they were given as limited; sometimes, he said, they were ""so small, that if I ate 300-400 calories a day, I was lucky"". 
Seredniak, who is 1.86m (6ft1in) tall, said his weight dropped to about 60kg (9st 6lb) while he was there, from his usual 80kg. ""Every time I got up,"" he said, ""I felt dizzy. My eyes darkened, I couldn't make any fast movements."" He believed this was deliberate: weakened, the captives would not put up any resistance.
Iryna Stohnii, a 36-year-old senior combat medic at the 56th Brigade, described the detainees as ""constantly malnourished"". ""They didn't feed us,"" she said. ""They didn't even let us go outside... We could only see the sky through bars in the windows."" Stohnii said the guards, in their twice-a-day inspections, forced her and other women to move in a stress position, with arms behind their backs and head to knees, and that some ""dragged us by the hair"". Other female captives told me women would be ordered to strip naked in front of male staff who, sometimes, made disparaging comments about their bodies.
One day, Stohnii said, a guard accused her of torturing pro-Russian soldiers in captivity and twisted her arms with so much force that ""he almost broke them"". A couple of times in our interview she cried. ""Only devils live and work"" at Taganrog, she said. After her release, Stohnii underwent surgery to remove adhesions - bands of scar tissue between organs that can be caused by trauma - which had developed in her kidney and bladder. ""Apart from rape,"" Stohnii told me, ""they did everything with us"". 
Denys Haiduk, a military surgeon, said guards forced him and the other captives to run with their heads down while under blows during their ""reception"", with detainees being hit even after they were on the ground, unable to stand up. Haiduk, who is 29, had helped the wounded at Azovstal and, in his interrogation, he was accused of amputating and castrating Russians in captivity, he told me. He denied it, saying that only Ukrainian fighters had been brought to him. 
As he recalled what had happened, I could sense the anger in his voice. Haiduk was pushed to the floor, and given electric shocks with a stun weapon until, he said, the battery ran out. Other captives said guards also used a military phone to give them shocks by connecting its wires to their bodies. ""You're convulsing,"" Haiduk said. ""If you lift your head up, they start beating you. And that circle never ends.""
Taganrog is also used as a transfer point and, to his surprise, Haiduk was only held there for two days, before his release in a prisoner exchange. As he left, the officers tried to force him to sign a document, declaring that any injury to his body had been accidental. Haiduk refused. He said guards beat and kicked him, and he heard a crack. 
Haiduk struggled to breathe, he recalled, and fell into the mattress he was holding. Later, after returning to Ukraine, he was diagnosed with three broken ribs as well as a cardiac contusion - a bruise to the heart muscle caused by trauma.
I asked him why he believed the guards were treating the Ukrainian detainees that way. ""Because they can,"" he said. ""You're a captive, and they abuse you."" When I asked Seredniak the same question, he gave me a more practical answer: ""They beat you to get some information. And then say: 'It's to make sure you don't go back and fight after the swap.'""
Lubinets, the Ukrainian ombudsman, said Russian authorities had created a ""system of torture"" for Ukrainian captives, typically in detention centres, in Russia and in occupied areas of Ukraine. Ukraine has opened up its facilities to experts; Russia, however, has restricted visits to only some locations. Janowski, from the OHCHR, said Moscow had repeatedly rejected the UN's requests for access without giving ""any legitimate reasons"". With most places closed to outside observers, Lubinets said, ""Russian soldiers can do anything with Ukrainian prisoners"". 
During his ""reception"", Artem Dyblenko, a 40-year-old sergeant major at the 36th Marine Brigade, overheard the guards talking about playing football with the captives. He was intrigued. ""What I didn't know was that we would be the ball,"" Dyblenko said. Blindfolded, he was ordered to run, he said, and fell. ""There were constant kicks. You did feel like a football.""
Dyblenko told me that, in September, one of his cellmates suffered a heart attack, which he attributed to the constant physical abuse. No-one came to treat him, according to Dyblenko, and the man died, aged 53. Three weeks later, Dyblenko was included in a swap and, in Ukraine, reported the case to the authorities. The body, he said, was returned at the end of last year. ""[His son] was given pictures of it,"" Dyblenko said, ""it was horrifying"". Ukraine acknowledged that bodies were exchanged in December, without giving details of the victims' identities, or how and where they had died. The man's son said he was waiting for the result of a DNA test and did not want to comment.
The Media Initiative for Human Rights, a Ukrainian organisation, recorded allegations of at least three deaths at the Taganrog prison, apparently because of torture and lack of food and health care. Mariia Klymyk, one of the group's investigators, said this was ""one the worst places for Ukrainian detainees in Russia"". 
She heard accounts of men being taken to interrogation and asked whether they had any children. ""If someone says they don't, they are beaten in the genitals,"" Klymyk said, ""while the guard says: 'For prevention of procreation.'"" And some Ukrainian soldiers had been put on trial, she said, with the apparent false confessions they had given in custody used as evidence against them. 
After almost 12 months in captivity, seven of them in Taganrog, Seredniak was released in a prisoner swap on 6 May, alongside 44 other Ukrainian fighters. He said the date would be celebrated as if it were his second birthday. The same exchange included Serhii Rotchuk, the doctor, who later discovered he had a fracture in his sternum - the breastbone - a condition associated with significant chest trauma, which he blamed on the abuse he had suffered.
I visited Seredniak four weeks after his return, at a flat in a residential compound on Kyiv's left bank, between his physical and mental rehabilitation sessions. Doctors had diagnosed him with a broken rib and cysts in the liver and kidney which, they said, were probably caused by the beatings. Seredniak had already regained some of the weight he had lost but still suffered lower back pain and, sometimes, struggled to walk.
On my phone, he watched for the first time a video of his swap, which had been published by the Ukrainian government. The captives were filmed shouting ""Slava Ukraini!"", or ""Glory to Ukraine"", and being welcomed by a cheering crowd. Pointing at a smiling man, Seredniak said: ""This is me!"" I could not recognise him. ""I was pale, skinny, with no access to sunlight,"" he told me. ""We were like bats, living in half-light.""

Hawaii wildfires: Joe Biden vows to visit soon amid criticism,"This video can not be played
Watch: 'This acrid smoke really sticks in your throat'
US President Joe Biden says he will travel to Hawaii ""as soon as he can"" amid criticism of his response to the island's deadly wildfires. 
Speaking in Milwaukee on Tuesday, Mr Biden said he wanted to ensure that the people in the state had ""everything they need"". 
The death toll from the fires is now 101 with some 1,300 people missing. 
Hawaii residents have complained about the pace of the federal government's response to the disaster. 
While at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, over the weekend, Mr Biden was asked by a reporter about the rising death toll in Hawaii, and responded: ""No comment."" 
The president said on Tuesday he had not yet visited because of concerns that doing so would divert resources and attention from the humanitarian response. Jill Biden will accompany him to Hawaii, he said. 
""I don't want to get in the way. I've been to too many disaster areas,"" Mr Biden said. ""I want to be sure we don't disrupt ongoing recovery efforts.""
Over 500 federal emergency personnel have so far been dispatched to help with relief efforts, including 150 search and rescue specialists. 
Additional personnel are being sent to Maui to help those already on the ground, Mr Biden added. 
He said that ""all available federal assets"" in the region would be used for recovery efforts, including the US military and Coast Guard. 
""It's painstaking work. It takes time and it's nerve wracking,"" the president said. 
The US Small Business Administration has also begun offering low-interest disaster loans to help local residents rebuild. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has approved one-time payments of $700 (£550) per household to help with immediate needs in the wake of the disaster. 
""Every asset they need will be there for them,"" said Mr Biden. ""And we'll be there in Maui as long as it takes."" 
In a video update on Tuesday, Governor Josh Green said he and Mr Biden were speaking ""often"" and would work out a time for the president to visit once ""the heart-breaking work is done on the ground finding those we've lost"".
Officials in Hawaii have said they expect the death toll to rise in the coming days as more bodies are recovered from the worst hit parts of Maui. Only 25% of the affected area has so far been searched for human remains. 
Approximately 80% of Lahaina - a town of about 12,000 residents - was destroyed in the blaze.
On the ground in Maui, many residents told the BBC they have been frustrated at the scale and the speed of the recovery efforts. 
One resident, Les Munn, said he had so far received $500 from Fema - less than the price of a night in most hotel rooms on the island. 
For now, he is still sleeping on a cot in a shelter. 
Another local, Felicia Johnson, said that ""everybody wants the glory but nobody wants to put their feet on the ground"".
On a street above the fire line in Lahaina, one woman said she feared she would starve to death in the days after the fire.
But now people are dropping bags of ice, water, clothing, batteries and small solar chargers at her neighbour's home, one of several grassroots relief supplies hubs co-ordinated by locals in the area.
Ahead of a second trip into the worst-hit area, Amory Mowrey spent $1,700 to load his and his friend's SUVs with toilet paper, cases of water, packs of batteries and sacks of rice.
""We're just trying to get supplies as fast as possible into the affected areas so people get what they need,"" he said. ""There's a lack of response, it felt like, from large organisations.""

Others expressed frustration that locally sourced supplies were being turned away by government officials, or that road closures had prevented people from entering Lahaina to help. 
""The government's getting in the way of people helping,"" said Liz Germansky, who lost her home in the fire. 
""I don't think the government could have done less,"" she told the BBC while sitting in a traffic jam on the island.
""The way things are unfolding right now is typical of what we all experienced on Tuesday... it's no wonder that this got so out of hand.""

VinFast: Vietnam EV maker valued at more than Ford or GM,"Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) maker VinFast's stock market valuation has soared above Ford and General Motors (GM) on its first day of trading.
Shares in the firm, which has yet to make a profit, closed above $37 (£29) each in their New York's debut.
That gave VinFast a stock market valuation of $85bn, much higher than Ford's $48bn and GM's $46bn.
It comes as motor industry giants and newer manufacturers fight for a slice of the booming EV market.
The listing added around $39bn to the wealth of VinFast's chairman and founder Pham Nhat Vuong, who was already Vietnam's richest man.
Regulatory filings show he controls 99% of the firm's outstanding shares, mostly through Vietnam's largest conglomerate, Vingroup JSC.
That limits the number of shares available for other investors to trade, which can lead to large price swings.
Trading in VinFast was relatively thin on Tuesday, with around $185m worth of its shares changing hands.
""Investors are continuing to believe that the future is in electric and that a low-cost East Asian country will emerge as a competitor in the US,"" said Bill Russo, Founder and CEO of Shanghai-based Automobility.
""The markets believe that given geopolitics that Vietnam, not China, will be that country.""
Instead of a conventional share sale, VinFast went public using a shell company, or special purpose acquisition company (Spac).
Spacs are often used by start-ups to speed up the often slow and expensive process of taking a private company public. In simple terms, it means merging a company that is not on a stock exchange with one that is.
Several EV makers - including Lordstown Motors and Faraday Future - have gone public using Spacs in the last three years.
However, both firms have lost more than 90% of their stock market value since their mergers.
Mr Russo said VinFast could be different because ""they are primarily backed by Vingroup, which gives them access to funding from a business that has a proven track record of growth"". 
""Most EV start-ups fail because they do not have profitable core and external funding eventually runs out as they burn capital far faster than they generate cash,"" he said.
But VinFast also faces tough competition as major players fight for market domination.
Market leaders - including Elon Musk's Tesla and BYD, which is backed by veteran investor Warren Buffett - have been cutting prices to boost sales.
In the first half of the year VinFast delivered 11,300 EVs, according to a company presentation. By comparison, Tesla delivered more than 889,000 vehicles in the same period.
""Tesla will continue to be the clear leader in EVs but there will be many winners,"" said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. 
""VinFast has built a strong foundation for EV success.""

"Michael Oher, subject of The Blind Side, and 'adoptive parents' in legal feud","A retired American football star whose rags-to-riches tale was adapted into an Oscar-winning Hollywood film has alleged the story is built on lies.
In 2009 movie The Blind Side, Michael Oher, a foster child in Tennessee, is adopted by a wealthy white couple and blooms into a star college athlete.
In a court filing, Mr Oher, now 37, alleges he was never adopted and was instead tricked into a conservatorship.
He alleges Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy made millions of dollars from his name.
An attorney for the Tuohy family told the BBC the ""hurtful and absurd"" claims were part of an effort to shake down the couple.
""They have consistently treated him like a son and one of their three children,"" Martin Singer wrote in a lengthy emailed statement.
Mr Singer alleged Mr Oher had said ""he would plant a negative story about them in the press unless they paid him $15 million.""
The BBC has reached out to the Oher legal team for comment.
According to the 26-page petition filed on Monday in probate court in Shelby County, Tennessee, the Tuohys tricked Mr Oher into making them his conservators shortly after he turned 18.
Conservatorships are US court orders that appoint a parent or legal guardian to oversee the personal or financial affairs of someone incapable of fully managing their own affairs because of their age or disability.
The Tuohys took full control over Mr Oher's ""ability to negotiate for or enter any contract, despite the fact he was over 18 years of age and had no diagnosed physical or psychological disabilities"", he alleges.
Mr Oher had shown sporting potential from a young age. But having grown up in foster care and fallen behind in school, he was in need of support and often stayed overnight at classmates' homes.
""Where other parents of Michael's classmates saw Michael simply as a nice kid in need, [the Tuohys] saw something else: a gullible young man whose athletic talent could be exploited for their own benefit,"" the document alleges.
The Tuohys allegedly told the teen they intended to legally adopt him and, soon after he had moved in with them in 2004, they presented him with what he believed to be adoption paperwork.
The couple lied that adopting someone over the age of 18 was called a conservatorship, the petition alleges.
""Michael Oher discovered this lie to his chagrin and embarrassment in February of 2023, when he learned that the Conservatorship to which he consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member of the Tuohy family, in fact provided him no familial relationship with the Tuohys,"" the court filing alleges.
Mr Singer, the Tuohy attorney, said the couple ""have always been upfront"" about the nature of the agreement and, if Mr Oher wishes to terminate it, they will ""never oppose it in any way"".
The Tuohys are further accused of using the conservatorship to enrich themselves at Mr Oher's expense as he excelled on the gridiron, becoming a two-time All-American, an accolade for outstanding athletes, at the University of Mississippi.
As his life story was adapted into a book in 2006 and a movie in 2009, the co-conservators allegedly negotiated a contract that split profits and royalties between them and their two birth children, while leaving nothing to Mr Oher for a lucrative story ""that would not have existed without him"".
The Blind Side went on to amass more than $300m (£237m) at the global box office and millions more in home video sales.
According to the court filing, the Tuohys negotiated a contract of $225,000 in addition to 2.5% of the film's net proceeds for themselves and their biological children, while Mr Oher ""received nothing"".
It asks the court to terminate the conservatorship, bar the Tuohys from continuing to profit from Mr Oher's name and likeness, and establish a full accounting of what he is fairly owed.
The lawsuit accuses the Tuohys of a ""gross and appalling"" breach of fiduciary duty.
Mr Tuohy rejected the claim, telling the BBC the Tuohys insisted on equally dividing up any money they received from Mr Oher's life story.
The Blind Side's release coincided with Mr Oher's start in the National Football League, where he played eight seasons, most prominently with the Baltimore Ravens.
The film earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and won Sandra Bullock, in the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy, her only Academy Award.
Mr Oher has long resented how the movie portrays him as mentally slow, which he felt had affected his career.
The ex-NFL star said in a statement: ""I am disheartened by the revelation shared in the lawsuit today. 
""This is a difficult situation for my family and me. I want to ask everyone to please respect our privacy at this time. For now, I will let the lawsuit speak for itself and will offer no further comment.""

Hawaii wildfires: The painstaking work to identify the dead,"Nearly a week after a devastating wildfire swept across Maui, the true death toll remains unclear. 
Families of around 1,300 missing people are waiting anxiously as cadaver dogs scour the blackened disaster zone.
The confirmed death toll of 101 people is expected to rise steadily. Hawaii's Governor Josh Green said on Monday that it could take as long as 10 days to reach an accurate figure, and investigators could find ""10 to 20 people per day probably until they finish"".
As of 15 August, only three of the dead had been positively identified, according to Adam Weintraub, the communications director of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. 
Victim identification specialists told the BBC that putting names to the rest of those who perished in Maui could take months or even years.
Both finding and identifying victims will be arduous given the magnitude of the destruction - which emergency workers have described as ""extremely hazardous"" - and the condition that many of the remains are likely to be found in.

""There's a lack of response, it felt like""
On Monday, Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier described the grim reality of the situation on the ground, telling reporters that ""it's not just ash on your clothing when you take it off. It's our loved ones"". 
""The complicated part is the collecting,"" said Daniele Podini, an associate professor of forensic molecular biology at George Washington University.
""Finding the right samples, identifying relatives, creating a database for all the relatives of the missing and then comparing the results from samples to that database... It's a combination of everything.""
Chris Milroy, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Ottawa, said that in Hawaii's case, many of these scientific methods may be complicated by destruction in the area.
""[Because] there has been a fire and disruption of civil services, you may not be able to get a hold of dental records. Some of the records may also have been destroyed in the fire,"" said Mr Milroy, who also worked on forensic investigations with police in the UK and with war crimes investigators in the Balkans. ""So that method may be out for a lot of people."" 
The high temperatures may have destroyed some victims' fingerprints, he added. The same may be the case for any documentation that would allow investigators to match a person with a medical device - such as a hip replacement or pacemaker - or for items from which DNA samples can be taken. 
""The principal thing that you're probably looking at is DNA,"" he said. ""But you also need people you can compare it to. But even then, you could also have something like brothers who died. You'll be able to say that they're related, but you won't be able to say which brother is which, unless you have other circumstantial evidence.""
Visual identification by relatives is considered unreliable, as is the discovery of personal belongings such as bags or wallets near sets of human remains. 
""There's an issue of commingling and remains that may be fragmented,"" Mr Milroy said. ""And since most of the people [who have died] are likely to be damaged by fire, what may happen is that a relative may go in and be so upset by the process that they say yes, and then it's not true. That's why scientific methods are preferred"".

Watch: ''Thank God that he gave us tears' Maui resident
Specially trained cadaver dogs are playing a key part in the search. The dogs are able to move through debris without causing further destruction and can use their keen sense of smell to detect human remains - even those that have been burnt to ashes that would be difficult to detect with the naked eye. 
While 20 additional cadaver dogs from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) have been deployed in the area, the amount of time they can work each day is hindered by high temperatures and a need for rest periods. 
While the challenges in Hawaii are acute, long delays in victim identification aren't unusual in the aftermath of fires and other catastrophic disasters.
After a fire gutted the 24-storey Grenfell Tower in London in 2017, for example, it took about five months for investigations to conclusively identify all 72 victims in the residential building. Once visible remains were removed from the scene, investigators had to use small towels and mesh sieves to find smaller and harder-to-identify pieces of human remains. 
In the US, remains retrieved from the wreckage of the World Trade Center towers after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 are still being identified. The remains of about 40% of those killed are still unidentified. 
Mike Marciano, a forensic scientist who teaches at Syracuse University in New York, said that the investigation in Hawaii will probably benefit from federal and out-of-state resources. 
This could potentially include help from the US armed forces' DNA Identification Laboratory, which is normally tasked with identifying the remains of lost servicemembers dating back as far as the Second World War. The lab has an $80m (£62.8m) facility at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on the nearby island of Oahu.
Even then, he said, the process will be a slow one. 
""This is going to be a process that's going to last much longer than weeks,"" he said. ""I would say months, but it all depends on resources"".

Why Ethiopia's Amhara militiamen are battling the army,"Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has found himself at the centre of a new conflict - this time in the vitally important Amhara region that marshalled its troops to help him thwart an attempt by rival Tigrayan forces to topple him.
The conflict is the latest sign that Mr Abiy is battling to live up to his Nobel laureateship - an honour bestowed on him in 2019 for ending long-running hostilities with Eritrea and setting Ethiopia on the path of democracy after almost three-decades of iron-fist rule. 
But Mr Abiy's reputation as a peacemaker and democrat has been further tarnished by the conflict in Amhara - the second-biggest region in Ethiopia. 
The violence has raised alarm internationally, with Israel evacuating its citizens and Jewish people from the region last week. 
Mr Abiy is facing a formidable challenge to his power from militias known as Fano - an Amharic word loosely translated as ""volunteer fighters"". The phrase was popularised in the 1930s, when ""volunteer fighters"" joined the army of Emperor Haile Selassie to fight Italian invaders. 
It is still used today by the farmers and young men who have formed militias to defend the Amhara people whose future, they believe, is threatened by the government and other ethnic groups. 
Although they have no unified command structure, these militias - or Fano - have demonstrated their strength in recent weeks by:
The crisis is so serious that many people say the Amhara state government - controlled by Mr Abiy's ruling Prosperity Party (PP) - is on the brink of collapse, with key officials having fled to the federal capital, Addis Ababa, for fear of being attacked. 
The violence can be traced back to the peace deal signed by the federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) to end the two-year civil war that saw Tigrayan forces advance towards Addis Ababa in 2021, before being forced to retreat back north. 
The agreement - brokered by the African Union (AU), with the backing of the US - was widely welcomed as an attempt to restore stability in Ethiopia - a vast country that has long been regarded as a lynchpin for security in the Horn of Africa and as the birthplace of pan-African unity. 
But the deal was met with deep suspicion among Amharas as they were excluded from the talks despite the fact that the Fano militias and Amhara special forces - a paramilitary group linked to the regional government - fought on the side of the federal army. 
The influential US-based campaign group, the Amhara Association of America, went as far as to describe it as a ""war pact"" - a charge denied by Mr Abiy's government.
Nevertheless, the perception took root in Amhara, especially after Mr Abiy then announced plans to dismantle the special forces present in each of Ethiopia's 11 ethnically based regions. 
He proposed that the special forces - which are thought to number in the tens of thousands - be integrated into the federal army and police force in order to foster ethnic unity and to prevent regional forces being drawn into conflicts - as was the case in Tigray when its special forces joined the rebellion against Mr Abiy's government in 2020, more than two years after he assumed the premiership. 
But many Amharas saw his plan as a red flag, arguing it would leave them vulnerable to attacks from neighbouring Tigray - their historic rivals for land and power in Ethiopia. 
Though some of the Amhara special forces have agreed to integrate into the army and police, many others have deserted to the Fano, hiding in mountains and villages and using their weapons to carry out raids on government and military posts. 
In some towns and villages, the militias have tried to establish their own administrations, in a direct threat to the power of the government.
So far, the prime minister has primarily relied on military force, with the lower chamber of parliament endorsing, on Monday, his decision to declare a six-month-long state of emergency in the region. 
This has placed Amhara under the de facto control of the security services. The region has been divided into four command posts, falling under the overall control of a committee chaired by intelligence chief Temesgen Tiruneh. 
The heavy deployment of troops has been backed up by airpower. On Sunday, an air strike was carried out in the town of Finote Selam, reportedly killing at least 26 people at an anti-government demonstration. 
This has fuelled speculation that the army will increasingly use its airpower to repel the territorial gains of the Fano, though it carries the risk of causing civilian casualties 
The government has neither confirmed nor denied that an air strike took place. 
Night-time curfews have been declared in six cities - including the regional capital, Bahir Dar - forcing people to stay indoors. 
The security forces have also set up check-points across the region, with reports that many Amharas have in recent months been barred from travelling to Addis Ababa, raising concerns of ethnic profiling. 
The authorities say they are trying to prevent potential trouble-makers from infiltrating the city. But this has fuelled the anger of Amharas, and has increased their sense of alienation from the federal government. 
During Monday's parliamentary debate, Ethiopia's former Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew - who was once also the leader of the Amhara regional government - said it was clear that the ruling party had lost its support there. 
He said there was a need to enter into dialogue, and to form a new interim administration in the region, but so far there is no sign of this happening. 
Some analysts point out that there is also conflict in other parts of Ethiopia - including in Mr Abiy's political heartland of Oromia, where the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) rebel group is fighting for what it calls ""self-determination"".
The federal government held peace talks with the rebels in April, but they failed to achieve a breakthrough, with the region still hit by conflict. 
Oromos form the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, followed by Amharas. 
The OLA has been accused of widespread atrocities against Amharas in Oromia, raising fears that it wants to drive them out of the region. The OLA denies targeting Amharas. 
When he took office, Mr Abiy championed his vision of Mademer, or ""coming together"", and ended state repression by unbanning opposition groups, freeing political prisoners and allowing exiles to return. 
He also launched the PP, a merger of different ethically based parties, believing that it would promote nationhood in a country where ethic loyalties are strong. 
But critics say that Ethiopia has returned to repressive rule, with Mr Abiy battling to gain popular support for his vision - the latest sign of this being the conflict in Amhara. 
It is unclear what the prime minister plans to do next but some analysts say he needs to convene a national forum where political and ethnic groups can discuss how best to resolve their differences so that peace returns to a nation torn apart by conflict.

Afghan women escape for a chance at education,"In her university room in Bangladesh, Nina, 19, holds her boxing gloves up to her face, staring into the mirror. 
She is learning to protect herself. She says there is no other way. Nina is one of hundreds of Afghan women who have taken up the offer of an education abroad, despite knowing they may never be able to return home.
Nearly 12 months ago, walking through Kabul airport, she says she felt far less strong. She remembers her hands shaking. She knew it was dangerous to flee Afghanistan. 
When airport officials questioned her, she lied: ""The Taliban don't allow women to travel alone so I said my mother was sick in Pakistan.""
She was relieved when they were convinced, but a harder challenge was yet to come. 
As Nina stepped onto the plane she stepped away from her home and family. ""On the day when I left I was crying that I might never see my mother's face again, it was so hard for me,"" she says.
""It broke my younger sister's heart. When I think about them, it hurts."" 
Since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan two years ago - in August 2021 - life has drastically changed for women in the country.
They lost their right to be educated past the age of 12, their right to wear what they want or travel alone for more than 72km. 
Nina is among those who was offered a way out - an education through programmes organised by the Asian University for Women (AUW).
As soon as the Taliban came to power, the AUW began receiving calls for help from their female students. Its founder, Kamal Ahmad, says he knew he had to get them out.
As western forces left the country they managed to evacuate a group of 148 women from Kabul as AUW students spread the word. Seven coaches made the dangerous journey to the city's airport a total of three times. 
The women were in the departures area when a suicide bomb ripped through the crowd outside one of the airport's gates on 26 August, killing more than 150 people.
""After an extremely traumatic journey to the airport, they boarded a flight with the US military and successfully landed in Saudi Arabia,"" Mr Ahmad said. ""All 148 women are now in universities across the United States. I just feel relieved that it wasn't a bad outcome.""
Since then AUW has offered scholarships and organised the evacuation of hundreds more women out of Afghanistan - 450 so far. These students have been sent to AUW's own university in Bangladesh, or partner colleges such as Brown University in the US, and Oxford and Manchester in the UK. 
AUW hopes to help more women - the goal is 1,000 - to continue their education by offering scholarships and a safe exit from Afghanistan. 
Safia, a journalist in her 20s, is another beneficiary of the scheme. She was heading to work the night the Taliban took over. The television studio where she worked was soon shut down and, with it, her career.
She says it was difficult to even leave her home for several weeks, amid the new restrictions placed on women.
""One day I decided to wear red and the Taliban tried to kidnap me, [putting me] in a box because I wasn't wearing all black. It was terrifying.""
Safia's capturers told her to go inside the post office to hand in her ID, passport and mobile phone, but instead, she fled.
""I believed with all my heart that they would shoot me from behind,"" she said. ""Despite the fact that I knew death is better than a Taliban capture in our culture, I screamed that I wouldn't go inside the post office, and with all my strength, ran"" she added.  
She says she ran past moving cars, nearly colliding with a few, but kept running until she reached a shop. She says by the time her husband found her, she could not speak. 
The Taliban never came looking for her, she says, but it was a small reprieve: she no longer had a job and she mostly stayed home, afraid to step out. 
Several months later she was offered a scholarship to study at AUW. She hopes that by continuing her studies she can help her family but she has no idea when she will reunite with any of them, including her husband. 
She says he helped her to leave Afghanistan by lying to airport officials about where they were going. She says they were questioned hard, and had to show a marriage certificate just to enter the airport.
""They kept checking for proof that we were husband and wife. They eventually let us through but it was tough. Then I had to travel through Iran, Dubai and then ended up in Chittagong. I had to leave my husband in Iran, it was so hard.""
Safia, who is currently enrolled in a pre-undergraduate programme, say she never wanted to leave. She believes Afghanistan needs journalists to speak up for ordinary people.
""I personally wanted to be a voice for the women who had lost their rights but my family wanted me to leave for my own safety.""
'The day I left my family forever'
Nina's parents also encouraged her to go to Bangladesh. But she says she worried about leaving them behind and the risk to them. She also found it difficult to adapt to a whole new culture and language.
But by her second semester she had created a boxing club. Now she has 50 female students in her class.
She believes self-defence and strength for women is important: ""I've always wanted to be able to protect myself and I want to teach others to do the same.""
She says for seven years, she worked hard at school and regularly boxed at the gym.
""But then in August 2021 I couldn't go to the gym, I couldn't continue my education, I couldn't even go outside.""
She says the Taliban took Afghanistan 20 years into the past: ""I cried. The situation is horrible.""
Now she wants to empower other women at the university to find strength and confidence. Like Nina and Safia all of them have left their lives behind and are trying to step into their future - but, for now, they have had to give up those they love.
""I wish for the women of Afghanistan to be free because I know they are trying so hard. I hope one day they can all continue their dreams,"" Nina says.  
Each of these women say they have something in common. They will never forget the women they've left behind.

How Argentina learned to love the US dollar,"Argentina's peso could soon be a thing of the past.
If Javier Milei, the front-runner in the campaign for the presidency, wins the election scheduled for later this year, the country's own currency could be abolished and replaced with the US dollar.
In some ways, it's surprising the idea hasn't caught on before. Argentines are reckoned to hold more greenbacks than anywhere outside the US and hoarding them is a way of life for many people.
The move is part of the right-wing libertarian's shock therapy plan aimed at transforming Argentina's economic prospects.
Polls show that 60% of Argentines oppose the idea because it would give too much power to the US central bank, the Federal Reserve.
But like it or not, the dollar already plays such a big part in their economy that to some, the idea feels like a foregone conclusion.
Argentines have traditionally set little store by their own currency, preferring to convert their spare pesos into dollars as soon as they can.
They don't trust financial institutions much either, so they resort to what is locally known as the ""colchón bank"" - that is, stuffing their dollars under the mattress.
Anecdotal stories abound of people keeping money buried in the garden, hidden in the walls or even secreted in heating systems - occasionally with disastrous consequences if there is an unexpected cold snap and the cash isn't retrieved before it goes up in smoke.
It's a symptom of the country's deep-seated structural economic problems. And like all chronic illnesses, it didn't develop overnight. 
To get to the root of the Argentine people's obsession with the US dollar, you have to go back to the dark days of the 1970s and 1980s, when periods of hyperinflation blighted the country's economy.
It's estimated that during the 1980s alone, middle-class Argentines saw their purchasing power shrink by 30%.
During that time, uncontrolled price rises eroded the value of wages and made a mockery of savings, to the point where people lost faith in their own currency.
The pesos in their pockets shed their worth so quickly that no-one held on to them for long. 
There were basically two ways of keeping up: buying goods in bulk or buying US dollars, because either of those would hold their value better than your original pay packet.
Now Argentina has a cost-of-living problem again, with annual inflation at 115%. This has led to an astonishing rise in the number of people living in poverty, from about a quarter of the population in 2017 to more than 40% now.
You might think that no self-respecting government would want this state of affairs to go on for ever. And you'd be right.
There have been various attempts to restore Argentina's confidence in its currency - either by shoring up its value or merely choking off the supply of dollars. But they have all, ultimately, failed.
The most ambitious effort was the so-called Convertibility Plan launched in 1991. This pegged the peso's value at one-to-one with the dollar.
Previous governments had fuelled inflation by printing money. But this time, it was decreed that every peso issued would be backed by one dollar in the central bank's vaults.
The idea was that by telling people they could swap their pesos for dollars at any time, they would eventually decide that they had no need to.
And for a time, it did the job. But it had other side effects which eventually led to a catastrophic economic meltdown in 2001-02.
Argentina had basically outsourced its economic policy to Washington, by locking itself into a currency regime that gave it no flexibility. 
Without going into too much detail, Argentina had also let its public debt get out of control. At the same time, the link to the dollar meant that it suffered from the ups and downs of the US economy.
In the two decades since that crisis, Argentina has basically muddled through under left-wing protectionist governments. 
Their solution to the peso's credibility problem has been simply to make it harder to buy dollars.
There are now as many as a dozen different exchange rates, depending on who wants to access the US currency and why.
For the official rate, you need 287 pesos to buy a dollar, but you can only buy $200 a month and you have to pay punitive taxes on the transaction.
After that, it gets increasingly bizarre. There is the Coldplay dollar rate (374 pesos to the dollar), especially created for foreign rock bands visiting the country.
And there is the Malbec rate (340 to the dollar), designed to boost exports of wine and other agricultural produce.
And yet the public's hunger for dollars continues, while everyone from taxi drivers to restaurateurs happily accepts the greenback as payment for goods and services.
It all makes dollarisation look desirable, maybe even inevitable. But it didn't have to be that way. Argentina's powerful neighbour and rival, Brazil, faced a lot of the same problems and yet chose a different path.
Brazil took a leaf out of Argentina's book in 1993 when it launched the Real Plan, pegging its own currency to the dollar.
But showing the eternal Brazilian ability to bend the rules, they gave themselves some wiggle-room, allowing the real's value to fluctuate, within limits, against the dollar.
Other economic and cultural factors helped Brazil, so it never developed the same distrust of banks and desire for the dollar.
In Brazil, no shopkeeper or snack bar owner will accept dollars as payment, no matter how much you plead. (I should know - I once tried it as a last resort when trying to pay for a meal in São Paulo because the restaurant's credit card machine had broken down. The stony-faced proprietor forced me to phone a friend to come and bail me out.)
Nowadays, both countries are far from the 1:1 exchange rate they adopted in the 1990s. But it takes just under five reais to buy a dollar in Brazil nowadays, whereas in Argentina - well, take your pick. 
Dollarisation for Argentina? It certainly wouldn't be the first South American country to do it - Ecuador got there in 2000 and pushed down inflation as a result.
And it might be easier to achieve than the idea recently mooted by the Argentine and Brazilian presidents - a common currency for the two countries, possibly to be called the ""sur"" or even the ""gaucho"".

Hunter Biden: The legal troubles of the US president's son,"A long-running investigation into US President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, may be heading for a jury trial.
The five-year probe appeared near its end last month, with Mr Biden, 53, agreeing to resolve tax and gun offences and avoid prison time.
But the case has since taken several dramatic twists and turns.
Mr Biden's plea agreement unravelled in court, and federal prosecutors have since argued it is no longer binding.
The man who was overseeing the investigation, David Weiss, has now been elevated to special counsel, giving him greater prosecutorial authority.
The lawyer guiding Mr Biden's case has withdrawn his representation amid concerns he may be called to testify against his client in the months ahead.
And all the while congressional Republicans have forged ahead with their own inquiries into Mr Biden's foreign business dealings.
Here is a guide to the first son's legal troubles.
In June, prosecutors with the US Department of Justice struck a two-part plea agreement with Mr Biden's legal team.
Under the deal, he was to be charged with two misdemeanour counts for failing to pay his taxes on time in 2017 and 2018.
He was also to admit that he had illegally possessed a gun while being a drug user, and agree to drug treatment and monitoring in lieu of a more serious felony charge and possible jail time.
Republicans argued the president's son was receiving ""a sweetheart deal"".
That claim was bolstered by two tax investigators, who testified to Congress that they believed political considerations had hampered the probe and benefited Mr Biden.
At a hearing in Delaware last month, the deal crafted over several months dissolved under scrutiny from the federal judge overseeing the case.
Both sides negotiated unsuccessfully in full view of reporters, before District Judge Maryellen Noreika refused to ""rubber stamp"" what she called an ""atypical"" agreement.
David Weiss, the US attorney in Delaware, began investigating allegations of Mr Biden's criminal conduct in 2019.
On 11 August, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Mr Weiss as special counsel, providing him with extra resources and the power to bring charges in other jurisdictions.

Republicans had previously advocated for the appointment of a special counsel, but have criticised the choice of Mr Weiss even though he is a Trump appointee. 
They have pointed to Mr Weiss' role in brokering the controversial plea deal, as well as the justice department's delay in appointing a special counsel, to argue that he will ""protect"" Mr Biden from further prosecution and slow down their own inquiries.
The continuing legal battle will also now proceed without Christopher Clark, Mr Biden's lead attorney for the past five years.
Mr Clark withdrew from the case on 15 August, writing in a court notice that he could be called as a witness in any potential trial to discuss the plea agreement.
Taking the baton from him is Abbe Lowell, a legal fixture of scandal-ridden Washington who has previously represented Bill Clinton, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.
In a court filing on Sunday, Mr Lowell said prosecutors had ""changed their decision on the fly"" about a deal he argued was still ""valid and binding"".
But Mr Weiss' team has indicated the deal is dead and only a trial will now bring a fair resolution to the case.
In a court filing, they wrote that the agreement on the gun charge ""never went into effect"" and ""none of its terms are binding on either party"".
They also called separately for the tax-related offences to be dismissed so that future charges can be brought in California or Washington DC.
Those two jurisdictions may have more scope to charge Hunter Biden's tax violations, although Republicans contend that is a ploy to get the case before friendlier judges.
Questions have been raised over the past two decades about Hunter Biden's business practices, and whether he had leveraged his name and access to his powerful father to make money and land clients.
Particular attention has been paid to what he was doing in China and Ukraine during Joe Biden's vice-presidency.

Watch: Why Hunter Biden is important to Republicans
In 2013, the younger Mr Biden became a founding board member at BHR, a private equity firm backed by some of China's local governments and largest state banks.
He went on to a hold a 10% equity stake, although attorney George Mesires has claimed that Mr Biden did not acquire the stake until after his father's tenure as vice-president ended in 2017. He remained with the board until 2020.
In 2014, Mr Biden joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company where he made about $1.2m per year.
His father was at the time engaged in anti-corruption work as the Obama administration's point man on US-Ukraine relations.
The elder Mr Biden argued the country's top prosecutor Viktor Shokin was blocking corruption investigations and he rallied the international community to push for his ouster.
But Republicans allege Mr Shokin, who was removed by parliament in 2016, was fired because he was investigating Burisma.
The president has long maintained he never discussed business with his son or his associates.
But Devon Archer, a long-time business partner, testified behind closed-doors to lawmakers that Mr Biden frequently put his father on speakerphone during calls with various contacts.
Congressman James Comer, who is leading the probe in the House of Representatives oversight committee, has alleged that the then-VP was ""the brand"" sold to enrich the Biden family.
On 9 August, Mr Comer cited bank records obtained by his panel that he said showed the Biden family and its associates had reaped $20m from oligarchs in Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine during his vice-presidency.
Separately, Hunter Biden's alcohol and drug abuse, and relationship strife, has provided ample fodder for the tabloids - and at least some measure of pain to his family.
In 2019, a DNA test confirmed that, despite his repeated denials, Hunter Biden had fathered a child with an Arkansas woman who filed a paternity suit against him.
Lunden Alexis Roberts has since settled that suit, with her child - Navy, now 4 - receiving an undisclosed amount in monetary child support as well as some of Mr Biden's paintings.
Ms Roberts also agreed to drop a previous effort to have her daughter's last name changed to Biden.
Amid pressure from US media, President Biden was forced to acknowledge his seventh grandchild for the first time late last month.

How undercover sting outwitted pangolin traffickers,"The leaders of a global wildlife trafficking gang have been convicted after a four-year investigation and a trial in Nigeria. 
They pleaded guilty last month to smuggling the scales of endangered African pangolins.
These ""top-of-the-pyramid"" traffickers were responsible for half the illegal trade in pangolin scales.
This is the story of how they were outwitted by fake buyers and sting operations - conducted by a small European charity. 
A young Vietnamese woman is on a dangerous undercover mission. 
She is sitting at a table in a café somewhere in Vietnam. Across from her is one of the country's main wildlife traffickers. 
Van - not her real name - is posing as a buyer for a Chinese crime boss in a trade illegal in many parts of the world, the trafficking of pangolins which are eaten in Africa, while their scales are used in traditional medicine in Asia. 
Outside, a surveillance team watches in case her cover is blown.   
""I was nervous for about 20 seconds but then, after that, I thought 'I can do this',"" she says.
Van's contact is trying to sell her scales from what the World Wildlife Fund says is the world's most trafficked mammal, the pangolin.
Researchers estimate that in the decade from 2010, almost a million pangolins were killed to supply trafficking networks. 
All eight species - four African and four Asian - are listed as threatened, with three considered critically endangered. 
Van works for the Wildlife Justice Commission, a charity set up in 2015 to disrupt criminal networks making money from wildlife trafficking.
Its lead investigator is Steve Carmody, a hard-nosed former Australian police officer who used to tackle drug gangs.
""My passion is to catch crooks,"" he says, at the charity's secret base in the Netherlands.
In 2018, Carmody noticed huge seizures of trafficked animal parts hidden in shipping containers en route from West Africa to Asia. 
He started gathering intelligence on the Asian buyers, in an investigation called Operation Hydra.
When the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, it offered him a rare and unexpected opportunity.
Big-time wildlife traffickers usually stay hidden, he explains: ""You may see their wives flaunting their wealth, but the main traffickers we investigate are not on social media.""
But Covid meant there were fewer shipments and, in desperation, traffickers turned to Facebook to find buyers.
""We started using multiple undercovers to talk with these guys,"" Carmody says. One was Van, whom he describes as ""the perfect person to take that investigation forward"". 
She is softly spoken with a steely determination. Being a woman in this business is unusual, but Van says it was an advantage as traffickers were more likely to drop their guard: ""They are not as suspicious as when a man approaches them.""
Over months she gained the trust of Morybinet Berete, who is from Guinea in West Africa but was based in Nigeria, the hub for the illicit trade in pangolin scales. 
Berete was ""living the dream"", says Carmody, ""driving a nice car, there was a nice house"". The team gave him the codename Genie for their surveillance logs, because someone liked the Disney film Aladdin. 
Despite the difficulties of mounting operations during the pandemic, Carmody says the job was made easier because operators like Berete tend to be business people who have drifted into crime: ""They don't have the skillsets you would see with a normal street-level drug supplier.""
This video can not be played
Morybinet Berete, aka Genie, on a video call with undercover investigators
Van went undercover online, gaining the trust of Berete on WhatsApp. In one video call he can be seen walking into the yard of a compound. He points the phone's camera at a large pile of a dozen or so sacks. One of them is opened at the top. It's full of pangolin scales he wants to sell to Van. 
There are more sacks across the yard, each stuffed with thousands of scales stripped from the carcasses of pangolins.
While undercover, Van had to conceal her true feelings, but two years later she remains shocked.
""A hundred thousand pangolins need to get killed for that,"" she says, ""I was so sad inside because I love animals. Wildlife is my passion.""
What was Morybinet Berete's view of the beautiful, secretive creatures whose scales he and his gang were trafficking?
""He's just doing business. The animals mean nothing to them,"" says Van.
But the WhatsApp video proved to be Berete's big mistake. Investigators used details from it to locate his address. 
""It's like Pablo Escobar telling you where he lives in Colombia, and showing the cocaine in his basement,"" says Carmody.
Corruption is a major driver of wildlife crime. Carmody describes the hardest part of any global investigation as finding a ""small group of dedicated law enforcement officers that can't be bought. And once you find them, it's like finding gold"". 
In Nigeria, that means the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS).
In July 2021, he tipped off NCS officials, who raided Berete's compound in Nigeria and seized 7,000 kilos of pangolin scales, with smaller amounts of claws and elephant tusks. They arrested three men, although Morybinet Berete was not at home. 
But searching the suspects' phones led to another big breakthrough - the identities of the Asian buyers. 
That shifted the focus of the investigation from Nigeria back to Vietnam, where a surveillance operation was mounted in March last year to follow the buyers. 
The traffickers were given their own codenames. Second-in-command was Benz, thanks to the Mercedes he drove.
Ringleader Phan Chi was Big Mac because someone in the surveillance team was hungry when they named him. 
Carmody laughs and says: ""More embarrassingly, another co-accused is Fries.""      
Pretending to be working for a Chinese buyer, Van built their trust, helping to figure out how the trafficking ring worked.
Big Mac bought trafficked scales from Berete who was now on the run in West Africa. The scales were smuggled out of Nigeria -mainly on boats - and sold on to clients in China. There, they were passed off as Asian pangolin scales, which can be legally used in traditional medicine. Shipments were often paid in cryptocurrency tied to the US dollar.
Another undercover investigator coaxed the gang into incriminating themselves. In a WhatsApp video call he asks what they want to buy. ""In Nigeria only pangolin,"" Big Mac responds.
Benz said he needed 20 tonnes of scales shipped to Vietnam, complaining that police had seized stock the previous summer. With the evidence mounting, the investigators were closing in.  
Last May, the Vietnamese traffickers returned to Africa to buy more wildlife products. From Mozambique, Benz sent video of rhino horn he had earlier hidden in suitcases to smuggle aboard a flight. 
Days later the gang arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, with Big Mac boasting in a video that he can ""send a container from here"".
What he didn't realise is that surveillance teams had been following him since his arrival in the country. The Nigeria Customs Service pounced. 
Big Mac was seized in his hotel room with two phones, providing a treasure trove of evidence. 
""This is a guy who did ledgers for each shipment: profit, loss, who he paid, what purpose, where it went,"" says Carmody.
""It's like you're reading an accountant's version of a criminal transaction. This evidence is overwhelming, linking these guys to multiple shipments of rhino horn, ivory and pangolin. Big Mac is a big deal. He's huge.""
Phan Chi (Big Mac), Phan Quan (Benz) and Duong Thang (Fries) were charged with smuggling and trading in pangolin scales and elephant ivory.
Faced with little chance of acquittal, they admitted their guilt on the eve of a trial earlier this month. Morybinet Berete's brother Mory also pleaded guilty. Other trials will follow. 
The four men were sentenced to six years each, avoiding more time behind bars by agreeing to pay fines as part of a plea bargain. 
For Steve Carmody, the convictions are ground-breaking. He says until now the focus in Africa has been on big sentences for wildlife poachers. Targeting the key players has been rare: ""I can't underestimate the value of this trial. These guys are the top of the pyramid.""
What about Morybinet Berete, aka Genie, on the run since July 2021 and facing a court order for his arrest?
""I like fishing,"" says Carmody. He points to the phones on his desk: ""I often throw out a few lines from different phones just to see who bites. Genie keeps biting.""
Soon Carmody, Van and the team hope to reel him in.

Firm regrets taking Facebook moderation work,"A firm which was contracted to moderate Facebook posts in East Africa has said with hindsight it should not have taken on the job.
Former Kenya-based employees of Sama - an outsourcing company - have said they were traumatised by exposure to graphic posts.
Some are now taking legal cases against the firm through the Kenyan courts.
Chief executive Wendy Gonzalez said Sama would no longer take work involving moderating harmful content. 
Warning - this article contains distressing content
Some former employees have described being traumatised after viewing videos of beheadings, suicide and other graphic material at the moderation hub, which the firm ran from 2019.
Former moderator Daniel Motaung previously told the BBC the first graphic video he saw was ""a live video of someone being beheaded"".
Mr Motaung is suing Sama and Facebook's owner Meta. Meta says it requires all companies it works with to provide round-the-clock support. Sama says certified wellness counsellors were always on hand.
Ms Gonzalez told the BBC that the work - which never represented more than 4% of the firm's business - was a contract she would not take again. Sama announced it would end it in January. 
""You ask the question: 'Do I regret it?' Well, I would probably put it this way. If I knew what I know now, which included all of the opportunity, energy it would take away from the core business I would have not entered [the agreement].""
She said there were ""lessons learned"" and the firm now had a policy not to take on work that included moderating harmful content. The company would also not do artificial intelligence (AI) work ""that supports weapons of mass destruction or police surveillance"".
Citing continuing litigation, Ms Gonzalez declined to answer if she believed the claims of employees who said they had been harmed by viewing graphic material. Asked if she believed moderation work could be harmful in general, she said it was ""a new area that absolutely needs study and resources"".
Sama is an unusual outsourcing firm. From the beginning its avowed mission was to lift people out of poverty by providing digital skills and an income doing outsourced computing tasks for technology firms.  
In 2018 the BBC visited the firm, watching employees from low-income parts of Nairobi earn $9 (£7) a day on ""data annotation"" - labelling objects in videos of driving, such as pedestrians and street lights, which would then be used to train artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Employees interviewed said the income had helped them escape poverty.

The company still works mainly on similar computer vision AI projects, that do not expose workers to harmful content, she says.
""I'm super proud of the fact that we've moved over 65,000 people out of poverty,"" Ms Gonzales said.
It's important, she believes, that African people are involved in the digital economy and the development of AI systems.
Throughout the interview Ms Gonzalez reiterated that the decision to take the work was motivated by two considerations: that moderation was important, necessary work undertaken to prevent social media users from harm. And that it was important that African content was moderated by African teams.
""You cannot expect somebody from Sydney, India, or the Philippines to be able to effectively moderate local languages in Kenya or in South Africa or beyond,"" she said. 
She also revealed that she had done the moderation work herself.
Moderators' pay at Sama began at around 90,000 Kenyan shillings ($630) per month, a good wage by Kenyan standards comparable to nurses, firemen and bank officers, Ms Gonzalez said. 
Asked if she would do the work for that amount of money she said ""I did do the moderation but that's not my job in the company"".
Sama also took on work with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.
One employee, Richard Mathenge, whose job was to read through huge volumes of text the chatbot was learning from and flag anything harmful, spoke to the BBC's Panorama programme. He said he was exposed to disturbing content. 
Sama said it cancelled the work when staff in Kenya raised concerns about requests relating to image-based material which was not in the contract. Ms Gonzalez said ""we wrapped up this work immediately"".
OpenAI said it has its own ""ethical and wellness standards"" for our data annotators and ""recognises this is challenging work for our researchers and annotation workers in Kenya and around the world"".
But Ms Gonzalez regards this type of AI work as another form of moderation, work that the company will not be doing again.
""We focus on non-harmful computer vision applications, like driver safety, and drones, and fruit detection and crop disease detection and things of that nature,"" she said. 
""Africa needs a seat at the table when it comes to the development of AI. We don't want to continue to reinforce biases. We need to have people from all places in the world who are helping build this global technology.""

Harrison Ford has a new Peruvian snake species named after him,"Harrison Ford's legendary Indiana Jones character may fear snakes, but the actor now has a real reptile named after him.
A new found species of snake in Peru has been named Tachymenoides harrisonfordi to honour the actor's environmental advocacy.
Ford, who is the vice chair of non-profit group Conservation International, called it ""humbling"".
The actor also has an ant and a spider named after him. 
""These scientists keep naming critters after me, but it's always the ones that terrify children,"" Ford told Conservation International.  ""I don't understand. I spend my free time cross-stitching. I sing lullabies to my basil plants, so they won't fear the night."" 
Unlike his character, Indiana Jones, Ford has repeatedly said he actually liked snakes and ""found a quick kinship with this one"".
""The snake's got eyes you can drown in, and he spends most of the day sunning himself by a pool of dirty water — we probably would've been friends in the early '60s,"" he said. ""It's a reminder that there's still so much to learn about our wild world - and that humans are one small part of an impossibly vast biosphere,"" 
The discovery, a joint collaboration between researchers from Peru and the United States, was made in Peru's Otishi National Park. 
The Tachymenoides harrisonfordi is a slender snake, measuring a modest 16in (40.6cm) when fully grown. It is not harmful to humans. 
""For a biologist, describing a new species and making it public with its new name is one of the most vital activities during the biodiversity crisis,"" said Edgar Lehr, the lead scientist on the project. ""Only organisms that are known can be protected.""
He hopes the discovery will draw attention to the extinction crisis facing species around the world. 
Reptiles are particularly prone to extinction, with more than a fifth of all reptiles currently under threat, a study co-authored by Conservation International researchers found. 
It was in 1993 that a new species was first named after Ford - the Calponia harrisonfordi, which is a California spider. Years later, an ant was dubbed after the actor - named Pheidole harrisonfordi.

Jakarta: Living with asthma in the world's most polluted city,"Multiple doctors have advised Farah Nurfirman to leave her hometown Jakarta for her health's sake. 
The 22-year-old asthmatic often wears a mask and carries an inhaler, but the air quality in the city is not helping. 
The Indonesian capital, which has long wrestled with air pollution, was ranked the most polluted city on global charts nearly every day last week.
President Joko Widodo on Monday even mandated that all civil servants work from home amid worsening air quality.
Last week, Jakarta saw its airborne concentration of the pollution particles known as PM2.5 outpace other heavily polluted cities such as Riyadh, Doha and Lahore, according to live data from Swiss air quality technology company IQAir. The company ranks pollution in major cities in real time every day. 
Jakarta has also been consistently ranked among the 10 most polluted cities globally since May. The capital city and its surrounding region are home to about 30 million people.
These days, Farah also carries an oximeter - a device usually placed on a fingertip to measure oxygen levels in someone's blood - to better monitor her condition.
""For people with asthma, even if your oxygen levels fall just a little, you can really feel it. And it's not just tightness, my chest really hurts. So it's hard to breathe,"" said Farah, who works as an intern at a marketing agency.
""My asthma is severe and also hereditary. Every doctor told me to move out of Jakarta. 'Get out of Jakarta if you want to get better, or you will continue to be like this,' they'll say.""
""I am quite tired because I can't do anything. But this is where I live. Apart from wearing a mask, there is not much I can do,"" Farah said.
Local authorities blame the pollution spike on the dry season and vehicle emissions, and will soon carry out random checks on vehicles and force drivers to undergo emission tests. 
President Widodo urged weather modification to produce artificial rain in Greater Jakarta, and advised companies to impose hybrid working. 
The city government is also considering an order for half of its civil servants to work from home.  
But Jakarta residents like Juan Emmanuel Dharmadjaya find themselves in a dilemma. ""I really want to stay in Indonesia because this is where I was born and my family is here. But the air pollution is a silent killer."" 
The 22-year-old previously suffered from tuberculosis and now has sinus issues. The deteriorating air quality is taking a toll on his health, he said. 
""I cannot focus on my daily life because my nose gets runny and very itchy all the time,"" said Juan, who works in the IT industry.
Alluding to his time as a student in Germany, he said: ""In Europe, I've never had a runny nose or cough even during the winter when the temperature goes below freezing. But when I returned to Jakarta, my nose immediately ran. It's so bad and clogged.""
Sigit Reliantoro, a senior official at Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry, told reporters at a press conference last Friday that dry air in June, July, and August has ""invariably"" led to an escalation of air pollution in Jakarta. 
Dry air typically means pollutants remain suspended in the air for extended periods. Wildfires are also more common during dry seasons.
Government research shows that vehicle emissions account for 44% of air pollution, Sigit noted. 
But activists like Muhammad Aminullah believe factories and coal-fired power plants are the primary contributors to Jakarta's toxic smog. 
Although Indonesia has big ambitions to cut carbon emissions - such as by phasing out coal for electricity by 2056 - it is currently the world's biggest exporter of thermal coal. Phasing out coal is costly because of the large numbers of people employed in related industries in Indonesia.
The government has not come down hard enough on these industries because of ""economic and political interests,"" said Aminullah, who leads The Indonesian Forum for the Environment, also known as Walhi. He claims that the ashes from burning coal are not properly managed even if the plant is located near a community settlement. 
Amrin (not his real name), who lives near a coal-fired power plant, is among those affected. 
He told the BBC his family used to store rainwater for bathing and consumption. But that was no longer feasible after the plant started operating in 2009.
""We don't dare to do that anymore because the water collected is black and contaminated by a lot of thick black dust on the roof,"" he said.

"New IPC, CrPC bill: Is India's planned criminal law reform a game-changer?","Last week, India's ruling government unveiled three new bills in parliament, stating that they would usher in a ""significant transformation in our criminal justice system"".
The bills are crafted to abolish and replace a trio of criminal laws. The Indian Penal Code and the Indian Evidence Act are antiquated colonial-era laws, while the Code of Criminal Procedure is half a century old. The bills have been referred to a parliamentary committee for further debate. Home Minister Amit Shah says their objective is to ""deliver justice, not mere punishment"".
India's criminal justice system needs urgent reform: shoddy police investigations often result in catastrophic miscarriages of justice; jails overflow with undertrials and the slow moving courts are clogged with some 50 million cases. 
Legal scholars say the bills do contain some significant changes covering a swathe of the justice system. 
For one, they bring offences like terrorism, corruption, mob lynching and organised crime under penal laws. They allow people to register a police complaint in any police station, regardless of the location where the crime took place. They propose video recording of search and seizure operations and increased use of electronic evidence and forensics during investigation. They introduce community service as a new form of punishment. They advocate speedier justice through video trials, and holding trials in absence of the accused.
Yet, experts are sceptical about how some of these laws will work. Anup Surendranath, a professor of law at Delhi's National Law University, says the manner in which the new offences - acts endangering sovereignty, organised crime, mob lynching, terrorism, rape by false promise to marry - are drafted ""continues to be so vague that it ends up giving the police unreasonably wide powers of arrest"". ""These vague provisions perpetuate the exercise of police powers in constitutionally unacceptable ways,"" he says.
For decades, successive governments have used India's colonial-era draconian sedition law against students, journalists, intellectuals, social activists and those critical of authority. The government now claims that it has taken a ""historic"" decision by repealing the controversial law. 
Not quite, say experts. The sedition law has been replaced by another in the new bill which punishes ""acts endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India"". In other words, experts say, this is really an expanded definition of sedition itself. ""Sedition should have gone. It has been retained and perhaps also strengthened,"" says Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, a senior fellow at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, a Delhi-based think-tank. 
Experts point out that the bills overlook certain crucial aspects. Marital rape has not been criminalised despite India having tough laws to deter sexual violence against women. (The Supreme Court is also getting ready to start hearing petitions seeking its criminalisation.) Offences that criminalise speech - including sedition and obscenity - require reconsideration. 
Then there's semantics. Mrinal Satish, a professor of criminal law at the Bangalore-based National Law School of India University, suggests that the terminology of ""modesty"" employed in the code for the offence of ""outraging the modesty of a woman"" should be taken out. The bills should have also ""revisited the offences relating to religion and blasphemy, some of which are still very vague and ambiguous to even qualify as criminal provisions"", according to Mr Ahmad.
Some of the proposals appear to be fuzzy. Mr Ahmad highlights a provision that mandates a minimum sentence of seven years in prison, life imprisonment, or even the death penalty for every individual within a mob - a gathering of five or more people - found guilty of committing murder based on considerations of race, caste, and community. 
""I am not sure what is the most appropriate punishment in this case, but certainly not the death penalty. Imagine sentencing a mob of 50 people to death for murder,"" Mr Ahmad says.
""Also, the bigger problem in these cases is the investigation, the evidence, and the manner in which the trial is conducted. I don't know how useful it is to club this offence with murder when we know that there are social and political factors that may impact these cases. This may need a very different approach - for determining guilt, collecting evidence and investigation."" 
Experts agree that many of the provisions in the 163-year-old Indian Penal Code are embarrassingly outdated. There's punishment for a thug, and the offence of obscenity is based on the ideas of Victorian morality. ""Except removing the reference to thugs and punishment for it, the new bill retains other outdated parts and definitions. Seeking to change an existing law on the ground that it was enacted during the colonial period is not sufficient justification,"" says Prof Satish.
Moreover, there exist formidable institutional challenges, say experts. For instance, the bills propose that every crime scene must undergo forensic investigation. ""But is India's forensic system ready to handle that? Everyone knows it isn't,"" says Prof Surendranath. 
Most experts say the new bills ""retain more than 80%"" of the 160-year-old Indian Penal Code, drawn up by British historian Thomas Babington Macaulay. Also, the 50-year-old Code of Criminal Procedure, they say, has been updated and amended regularly, including as recently as 2018. ""This is not an overhaul,"" says Prof Surendranath. ""The majority of these bills retain exactly the same existing provisions under new names"".
Experts say instead of repealing laws and dealing with the massive administrative challenges that would follow them, India could have just amended the existing laws. Countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Bhutan are still using the colonial penal code - Singapore recently made amendments to update it and introduce present-day requirements. India also changed and updated its law on sexual violence in 2013. ""That would have been the way forward, not what the bills propose to do,"" says Prof Satish.

Poland military parade: 'Perfect day to show our strength',"This video can not be played
Poland has held its biggest military parade since the Cold War in the capital, Warsaw. 
It marked the Polish defeat of Russian-led Bolshevik forces in 1920. Poland is providing strong military support for neighbouring Ukraine to counter the Russian invasion.
Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak told the crowd ""we have built powerful armed forces that will effectively defend our borders without hesitation"".

Texas woman awarded $1.2bn in revenge porn case,"A Texas jury has awarded a woman $1.2bn (£944m) after ruling that she was the victim of revenge porn.
The woman, who was named only by the initials DL in court documents, filed a harassment lawsuit against her former boyfriend in 2022.
The suit alleged that he posted intimate pictures of her online to ""publicly shame"" her after a break-up. 
Her lawyers in the case said the settlement is a win for victims of ""image-based sexual abuse"".
""While a judgment in this case is unlikely to be recovered, the compensatory verdict gives DL back her good name,"" said Bradford Gilde, the lead trial lawyer, in a statement.  
The lawyers had originally asked the jury for $100m in damages.
""We hope the staggering amount of this verdict sends a message of deterrence and prevents others from engaging in this despicable activity,"" Mr Gilde added.
According to court documents, the woman and her former boyfriend began dating in 2016. 
The woman had shared intimate photos of herself with the defendant during the relationship. After a break-up in 2021, he is accused of having posted the photos on social media platforms and adult websites without her consent.
He allegedly sent links of the photos to her friends and family through a publicly accessible Dropbox folder. 
He was also accused of having access to her phone, social media accounts and email, as well as to the camera system at her mother's home, which he used to spy on her.
At one point, the defendant allegedly sent the woman a message: ""You will spend the rest of your life trying and failing to wipe yourself off the internet. Everyone you ever meet will hear the story and go looking. Happy Hunting.""
Lawyers for the woman claim her former boyfriend posted the pictures ""to inflict a combination of psychological abuse, domestic violence and sexual abuse"".
He did not show up in court and did have an attorney to represent him, according to US media reports. 
He was ordered to pay the woman $200m for past and future mental anguish, as well as $1bn in exemplary damages. 
High settlements have been reached in US revenge porn cases in the past. In 2018, a California woman was awarded $6.8m after her former partner shared explicit photographs of her on porn sites.
DL told a Texas broadcaster that after receiving little assistance from local police she turned to a civil attorney. 
In 2016, around 10 million Americans reported being victims of non-consensual - or revenge - porn. Many of them are women aged 18 to 29, according to a study at the time by the Data & Society Research Institute. 
All US states, with the exception of Massachusetts and South Carolina, have anti-revenge porn laws in place.

Plane fault scuppers German foreign minister's Sydney trip,"German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has cancelled a trip to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji after her government plane was forced to make a second emergency landing in two days.
She was left stranded in Abu Dhabi after the 23-year-old Airbus A340-300 had repeated wing flap problems.
""This is beyond annoying,"" the minister wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.
Germany may enjoy a reputation for efficiency, but its government planes are notoriously unreliable. 
In 2018 the same Airbus plane had a technical fault which forced the then Chancellor Angela Merkel to miss the opening of a G20 summit in Argentina.
Earlier that year, Olaf Scholz - Germany's finance minister at the time and now chancellor - was stranded in Indonesia after rodents chewed through cables on that plane.
Ms Baerbock was en route to the Indo-Pacific on Sunday when the wing flaps on her plane malfunctioned, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing in the United Arab Emirates.
After repairs and a successful test flight, the aircraft took off again on Tuesday - only for the same problem to arise.
In the end, the minister was forced to cancel her planned week-long trip. Her team could not be booked onto commercial flights within the time schedule.
""We have tried everything: unfortunately it is logistically impossible to continue my Indo-Pacific journey without the defective plane,"" Ms Baerbock wrote on X.
The plane had to dump fuel in order to land back in Abu Dhabi safely.
Owing to the mishap, Germany's Luftwaffe Air Force announced that it would retire the plane early. The government's other A340-300 will also be replaced.
""We will take the two #A340 out of service as soon as possible, ie in the coming weeks,"" it said in a post on X.
Instead, top government officials will soon be using recently bought A350 planes.    
""With the A350s, the Air Force has robust and modern aircraft at its disposal for long-haul operations,"" the Luftwaffe said.
In May Mexico also finally resolved a government plane problem: for more than four years it had failed to sell a luxury presidential jet, but in the end the Tajik government bought it.

Mother of six-year-old who shot Virginia school teacher pleads guilty,"The mother of a six-year-old who shot his teacher in a Virginia classroom has pleaded guilty to a charge of felony child neglect, US media report.
Deja Taylor, 26, entered the guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors to lessen the sentencing from up to six years to six months. 
Her son shot Abigail Zwerner, a teacher at Richneck Elementary School in the city of Newport News, on 6 January.
Taylor's sentencing is scheduled for 27 October.
As part of Taylor's plea deal, a separate misdemeanour charge of reckless storing of a firearm was dropped. 
James Ellenson, a lawyer for Taylor, said his client remains remorseful, although he believes no prison time will be the appropriate sentence, NBC News reported.
""She feels very responsible, feels very bad,"" Mr Ellenson told reporters after the hearing.
The BBC has contacted Mr Ellenson for comment.
Taylor had previously told police she believed the gun was in her purse, secured with a trigger lock, and that the gunlock key was under her bedroom mattress. 
But in her guilty plea she reportedly admitted that the gun was stored in a way that made it accessible.
An assistant Newport News Commonwealth's Attorney said in court on Tuesday the six-year-old took the gun from his mother's purse, which was on top of a dresser, according to the Washington Post. The gun was not secured with a trigger lock, the prosecutor said.
The shooting, which made national headlines in January, cast a renewed spotlight on issues of school safety and gun violence. 
Ms Zwerner was hit in the hand and chest, resulting in a weeks-long hospital stay and multiple surgeries. She filed a $40m (£31.4m) lawsuit against the school district earlier this year.
Newly revealed court documents unsealed in August added additional details about the tragic encounter. 
The six-year-old is said to have admitted ""I did it"", adding ""I got my mom's gun last night"", shortly after the shooting. The boy has not been charged.
Taylor had pleaded guilty in June to a federal charge of using marijuana while possessing a firearm. The sentencing in that case is also  scheduled for October.

US tourists stay in Eiffel Tower overnight while drunk - prosecutors,"Two American tourists in Paris have been found sleeping inside the Eiffel Tower after getting stuck while drunk, according to prosecutors.
The two men were found by security guards in the early hours of Monday. 
They paid to visit the landmark at around 22:40 (20:40 GMT) on Sunday and hopped security barriers while coming down the stairs, police said.
They were found in an area normally closed to the public between the tower's second and third levels.
The men ""appear to have got stuck because of how drunk they were"", Paris prosecutors told the AFP news agency. 
A specialist firefighter unit for rescuing people from heights were sent to recover the men, the agency reported.
The usual opening time of 09:00 was delayed due to the discovery of the inebriated pair. 
They did not pose any threat, said Sete, the publicly-owned Eiffel Tower operator.
Both men were questioned by police in Paris, while Sete said it would file a criminal complaint.
It comes after two bomb scares at the tower on Saturday forced the monument to be evacuated twice in the same day.
French police have launched an investigation after the false bomb threats were made via posts on a gaming site and a platform for online contact between citizens and police.
The Eiffel Tower, which was built in the 1880s and stands at 300m (984ft), attracted 5.8 million visitors last year.

Matildas mania sweeps Australia ahead of England semi-final,"Lizzie Wilson was never a sports fan.
A month ago, the 24-year-old hadn't ever sat through a match - of any kind - or even heard of the Matildas. Now, she lives and breathes football.
""I'm one of the Matildas many new followers on Instagram, I've been deep diving on YouTube, I made myself learn the offside rule… I've [even] been dreaming about their penalty shots.""
""I'm like: 'What is wrong with me'… that's the kind of level of obsession.""
It's a familiar story unfolding across the country. From rural pubs to city stadiums, Matildas fever has well and truly taken hold.
Getting a seat at Wednesday's semi-final against England has felt like finding a Willy Wonka golden ticket, with many arguing it's tougher than than securing admission to a Taylor Swift concert.
It's hard to walk anywhere in Sydney without seeing homages to the team - massive posters are plastered on skyscrapers, billboards scream players' names, and fans are decked out in green and gold.
Saturday's game against France was Australia's largest television sporting event in at least a decade, with an estimated average viewership of 4.17 million. Post-match highlights saturated social media. 
Many hope the Matildas' meteoric rise and World Cup mania will be a turning point for women's football in Australia. 
It was not long ago that the team was still playing to empty stadiums.
In 2014 one of the best women's sides, Brazil, flew to Brisbane to face the Matildas in two friendlies. 
The first match sold fewer than 2,600 seats, forcing Australia's Football Federation to close the stadium for the second meet, as it was too costly to run an empty venue. 
In the early years, players reportedly handed out fliers to attract people to their games, and phoned television stations to ask them to broadcast their matches. During the 2003 World Cup in the US, not a single journalist turned up to the Matildas' airport press conference. 
But since then, the team has fought for recognition, airtime, and equality. Their efforts have paid off.  
Throughout this tournament every Matildas match has been effectively sold out - with millions more fans flocking to viewing sites across the country, tuning in online or at their local watering hole. 
The team's kit is flying off the shelves leaving suppliers like Nike struggling to keep up, and there's even talk of a national holiday if they lift the World Cup trophy. 
""For decades they told us nobody cared. We didn't believe them. Now they believe us,"" the team's media manager Ann Odong posted on Saturday, following their dramatic quarterfinal penalty shootout with France. 
The Matildas' success on-field is part of the story. They're history makers.
Australia has always been sports obsessed, but when it comes to football, no national squad has ever made it this far on the World Cup stage. 
The best performances from the men's team - the Socceroos - were round of 16 finishes in 2006 and 2022. And until now, the Matildas have consistently bowed out around the quarterfinal mark. 
But their grit in the face of adversity is what captures hearts and minds, says football journalist Samantha Lewis.
""The Matildas' motto is 'never say die', and that spirit of fight and perseverance is not only seen in the way they play on the field, but also in all of the things they've achieved off of it, such as collective bargaining agreements and equal pay,"" she told the BBC.
For a nation that's always loved an underdog story, the attitude is very on brand.
""That's the reason why they resonate so strongly with the country: they reflect how we want to see ourselves,"" Ms Lewis says.
The fact that it is England - one of Australia's greatest sporting rivals - that stands between the squad and a World Cup final, has created a fever pitch of nervous anticipation. 
And Ms Wilson is counting down the minutes until the semi-final against the Lionesses. 
""I'm incredibly stressed and also very excited. It's intense.""
Regardless of the outcome on Wednesday, Football Australia says the Matildas have sparked a movement.
""The interest we're seeing around our game right now is phenomenal,"" the association's head of women's football Sarah Walsh says. 
""I think this is going to be the World Cup where we move beyond saying 'no-one's watching' to 'hey, who's paying?'"" 
A former forward who played for the Matildas from 2004-2012, Ms Walsh aims to leverage the tournament's success to take the game to new heights here. 
That means ""driving structural change"" to close the opportunity gaps that persist for women and girls, she says.
But Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson believes his team has already broken cultural barriers. 
""This team can create history in so many ways, not just by winning,"" he told a recent press conference.
""[It's] the way that they can inspire the next generation, how they can unite a nation or [how] they can leave a legacy that is much bigger than 90 minutes of football. I think that is also why I believe in them so much."" 
Ms Wilson is a testament to that. As someone who felt sidelined from sports as a kid, she feels included in that world for the first time.
""Watching these women on screen I'm like: 'Oh my God, I want to be that strong. I want to be able to run that fast.'""
But above all, she's feeling proud.
""I literally went out [on Sunday] and bought myself a newspaper, just so I could have [the Matildas] photo on the front… crazy.""

"Canadian donair sandwich costume sells for $16,000","A dusty costume of a tinfoil wrapped donair sandwich has sold in Canada for C$16,025 ($11,900; £9,400). 
The strangeness of the listing - and the fact it depicts a beloved Canadian street food - captured hearts when it was posted online on an Alberta government surplus auction site. 
That sparked a bidding war for the never-used outfit between rival donair restaurants across the country. 
The 4ft 8in (142cm) suit was eventually won by an Alberta donair chain. 
For those unfamiliar with the food, a donair is derived from the Greek gyro and Turkish doner kebab, said Canadian food writer Lindsay Wickstrom, who has written a book on the snack. 
Greek immigrant Peter Gamoulakos created the sandwich in the mid-1970s in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 
The restaurateur had ambitions of bringing the gyro to Atlantic Canada, but discovered that the savoury of flavours of garlic, yogurt and lamb didn't align with local tastes at the time. 
So he put a slightly sweeter spin on the sandwich. 
A donair has spiced ground beef shaved into a grilled Lebanese pita and covered in a sauce of evaporated or condensed milk, and vinegar and sugar. There is often a hint of garlic, and tomato or onion as a topping. 
""The late night food that you eat after some drinks usually,"" Ms Wickstrom told the BBC.
It's since been declared Halifax's official food, reaching ""iconic and unique"" status. 
The dish eventually made its way west to Alberta, where it was already popular with Atlantic Canadians who had settled there to work in the oil industry. 
There, it is often sold with a controversial addition: lettuce. 
""People in Halifax are purists about the donair,"" Ms Wickstrom said. ""You will be publicly shamed, even driven out of the city for even putting lettuce on it.""
Under a wave of interest earlier the summer, Alberta revealed the origins of the donair costume, which comes with a ""silver-coloured body suit for that authentic tinfoil look!"".
The one-of-a-kind outfit was bought in 2015 for an anti-drug awareness campaign that in the end was never produced. In July, it ended up listed under the ""oddities"" section of the auction site. Condition: dusty but excellent. 
But the costume features lettuce, fuelling a long-standing regional dispute between Halifax and Edmonton on what constitutes a true, authentic donair. 
Adil Asim, the owner of the Alberta-based restaurant chain Prime Time Donair & Poutine, told the BBC on Tuesday that he entered the bidding competition to save the lettuce, after Halifax restaurants vying for the costume promised to remove it.
""I am born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, and I had my first donair at the age of two"" most of which had the leafy green on them, the 42-year-old said.
For Canadian YouTuber Steve Wallis, a life-time of eating donairs inspired him to join the bidding war for the man-sized outfit. 
The 41-year-old said he hoped to use it to raise money for food banks, a cause his late wife was passionate about. 
""Who wouldn't want a profile picture of them with this donair? It's just attracted so much attention,"" he said. 
Mr Wallis was eventually outbid in the final hours of the auction by Mr Asim.
But the two have since connected to collaborate on a charity event that will feature the costume. 
""If we can use this suit to do some good (and have some fun while doing it), then we think everyone can be a winner here,"" Mr Asim told Mr Wallis in a message shared on social media.

"Sara Sharif: International manhunt over murder of girl, 10","An international manhunt for three people continues following the murder of 10-year-old Sara Sharif.
The girl's body was found alone in the early hours of last Thursday morning at her home in Woking, Surrey.
Surrey Police said the three people it was trying to locate - who were known to Sara - left the UK the previous day.
Sara's mother Olga Sharif said her life ""will never be the same again"" as she spoke of her loss in an interview with The Sun.
Formal identification has yet to take place, and investigators are still at the property where Sara's body was found in Hammond Road.
Detectives are working with international authorities to find those they want to speak to in connection with her death. They have released no information about the three people publicly. 
No arrests have been made and a post-mortem examination will take place on Tuesday.
Ms Sharif described her daughter as an ""amazing girl"", and told The Sun she was ""too young"".
""There is nothing I can do that can bring her back to life, so I have to only remember the good times with her now,"" she added.
The local imam said the community had been shocked by her death.
Hafiz Hashmi, Imam of the Shah Jahan Mosque, said he had not been able to sleep in recent days. 
He told BBC Radio Surrey: ""We are immensely shocked and saddened. Can't believe something like this can happen to such an innocent child.
""We don't know the circumstances around the death so we pray for the girl's soul to be at peace. We pray that we are able to find the truth surrounding her death so that loved ones can lay the girl to rest.
""People are shocked.""
In a statement, the mosque said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Sara whose innocent life was taken last week"".
The statement added: ""Our thoughts, prayers and condolences are with her and her loved ones during this difficult and testing time.""
A local church, St Mary the Virgin, in Horsell, has been open since last Friday for members of the community to attend for ""prayer, reflection or comfort"", while floral tributes have been left outside the house.
Last week, there was a heavy police presence at the semi-detached property on Hammond Road and neighbours told reporters a Pakistani family with six ""very young"" children had  moved into the house in April.
Speaking after the discovery of Sara's body, a neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, said she ""appeared to help look after her younger brothers and sisters, and especially the baby"".
They ""seemed a happy family who cared for all their children"", they said.
Sara's body was found at the empty house at about 02:50 BST on 10 August.
Anna Bradshaw, an extradition law specialist at the London firm Peters and Peters, said any future legal proceedings involving foreign courts were likely to be protracted.
""That's an opportunity for the person to contest their extradition"" she said.
""Some countries do not extradite their own nationals. Most countries will insist on the prima facie case to be met, and almost all countries will have some variation of a human rights test.""

Who are the 18 others charged alongside Donald Trump in Georgia?,"As former US President Donald Trump is charged with attempting to overturn his 2020 election defeat in Georgia, who are the other 18 people accused along with him?
Here's a potted guide to the others charged, with input from BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher (AZ).
Perhaps the best known of the co-accused, the former mayor of New York City was a personal lawyer for Mr Trump at the time of the election.
He led legal challenges to dispute the outcome of the elections, and is accused of making numerous false statements about election fraud, including claims that errors had been made by the Dominion vote-counting machines.
He faces 13 charges, more than any of the co-accused except for Mr Trump himself. He has dismissed the investigation against him as politically motivated.
AZ: As mayor of New York, Giuliani was one of the most popular politicians in the US. As a close adviser after the 2020 election, he helped organise attempts to challenge Mr Trump's defeat at the polls. 
Mr Eastman, a lawyer for Mr Trump, represented the former president in a lawsuit trying to overturn election results in four states he lost in 2020.
In Georgia he is alleged to be part of a plot to urge state senators to disregard the election results and appoint fake electors.
AZ: A California law professor who advanced the theory that Vice-President Mike Pence had the power to reject the certified results from certain states that Mr Trump lost in 2020, including Georgia, based on allegations of voting irregularities. 
Another Trump attorney and a vocal promoter of false fraud claims.
Some of her more outlandish claims - that electronic systems switched millions of votes to President Biden and that he won thanks to ""communist money"" - led Mr Trump's team to distance itself from her in the weeks after the election.
AZ: A lawyer closely tied to Mr Trump's attempts to challenge the 2020 election results. She is also alleged to have been involved with an illegal breach of election data in Coffee County, Georgia, in an attempt to find evidence of voter fraud.
Mr Chesebro is an appellate lawyer who first became involved in the Trump campaign's post-election efforts in Wisconsin before expanding into other states lost by Mr Trump.
In Georgia he is accused of helping to devise a plan to submit fake slates of electors for Mr Trump.
It is alleged he wrote a memo that provided instructions for how such electors in states including Georgia should proceed to meet and cast votes for Mr Trump.
AZ: The indictment alleges this scheme constituted, among other things, fraud and forgery.
Another of Mr Trump's legal team alleged to have been involved in trying to get false electors appointed in four states, including Georgia.
She is said to have written legal memos for the former president advising how then vice-president Mike Pence could delay the certification of Mr Biden's election win.
AZ: A Trump attorney who, along with Mr Giuliani, was one of the most ardent supporters of allegations of election fraud and an organiser of attempts to reverse the election results. 
A member of the Trump legal team who filed one of the campaign's election challenges in a state court and is alleged to have made false claims at a legislative hearing in the state.
A Georgia-based lawyer, accused of making unfounded accusations that election workers were double and triple-counting votes.
He has also served as an attorney for another of the accused, Cathy Latham, according to the Washington Post.
AZ: Smith and Cheeley are attorneys involved in the Trump team's efforts to advance ""alternate"" presidential electors who claimed Mr Trump won Georgia
The former congressman was Mr Trump's chief of staff at the time of the election.
He is alleged to have tried to pressure a chief investigator to speed up signature verification in Fulton County and to have been involved in a phone call in which Mr Trump tried to persuade Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to overturn Joe Biden's victory in the state.
AZ: A former conservative leader in the House of Representatives, he headed the Trump White House team. He has been indicted for his involvement in that phone call.
A former Department of Justice (DoJ) official, Mr Clark is accused of trying to persuade the then acting attorney-general to write to the Georgian authorities claiming voting irregularities had been found there.
He is also alleged to be part of wider efforts to use the department to investigate voter fraud.
AZ:Mr Trump reportedly considered making Mr Clark the acting US attorney general - but he backed down when other senior Justice Department officials threatened to resign en masse.
A senior member of the Trump election campaign, he is said in the indictment to have played a role in organising the fake electors' plot.
At the time, Mr Shafer was chairman of the Georgian Republican Party.
He is one of those charged with mailing a fake certificate of Trump electors to a federal courthouse, and making false statements to investigators.
He portrayed himself as the ""chairperson"" of the 16 fake Trump electors.
AZ:He led the meeting of ""alternate"" electors who claimed Mr Trump won Georgia.
Former election supervisor of Coffee County, who is alleged to have helped Trump supporters gain access to the county's voting equipment.
She also made a video soon after the election claiming that voting machines used in the county could be manipulated.
Former Republican Party chair in Coffee County and one of the 16 fake Trump electors for the state.
Then finance chair of the state Republican Party and now a Georgian state senator, he was another of the fake electors.
A former publicist for R Kelly and Ye (formerly known as Kanye West), accused of involvement in a plot to pressure a Fulton County election worker to falsely admit committing fraud.
A Lutheran pastor from the state of Illinois accused of efforts to intimidate election workers in the Georgian state capital Atlanta.
Former head of a group called Black Voices for Trump, also accused of intimidation of Atlanta election workers.
Bail bondsman and Trump supporter involved in allegedly trying to gain access to sensitive election equipment in Coffee County.
AZ: Lee, Floyd and Kutti are Trump supporters alleged to have attempted to illegally pressure Ruby Freeman, a volunteer election worker, into admitting that she committed election fraud.

Telford bridging hotels to close as Afghan refugees get housed,"Permanent accommodation has been provided to 325 Afghan refugees, a council said.
Telford and Wrekin Council said all bridging hotels will close on Friday after the refugees were given permanent accommodation.
The Home Office has given until the end of August for refugees to leave bridging hotels.
Cllr Kelly Middleton said the authority had worked hard to offer the accommodation.
Last month, council leader and chair of the Local Government Association (LGA), Shaun Davies, said there was a risk of Afghan families becoming homeless and ending up in temporary accommodation due to a housing shortage.
Hotels were not meant to be long-term accommodation for Afghans who fled the Taliban in 2021 and they should not be in them ""for months or years on end"",  a government spokesperson said.
In Shropshire, the council said despite the county not having any bridging hotels, they received ""allocated capital grant funding from government to acquire up to 13 dwellings by the end of March 2024"".
""We hope this funding will help these families to settle in Shropshire, while creating more homes for future needs, and enable these people fleeing conflicts to continue integrating into their communities through work and everyday life here in Shropshire,"" Dean Carroll, cabinet member for housing, added.

Ukraine war: Three killed after blasts in Lutsk and Lviv,"Three people have been killed by Russian missile attacks in the Volyn region of north-western Ukraine, local officials have said.
Several were wounded after a factory in Lutsk was hit, said regional head Yuriy Poguliaiko.
Air strikes also damaged buildings in the western Lviv region, but there were no deaths, the city's mayor said.
Ukraine's air defence forces said they had destroyed 16 out of at least 28 missiles launched by Russia overnight.
Air raid sirens sounded for two hours in Lviv and Volyn. 
In Lutsk - Volyn region's capital - a factory owned by a Swedish company was hit by the strikes. 
""We are very sad to confirm that three of our colleagues have been killed,"" SKF company spokesman Carl Bjernstam said.
Homes appeared to have been hit in the city, with local officials saying most of the damage was caused by falling debris from intercepted missiles.
In Lviv more than 100 buildings were damaged as a result of the overnight attacks, according to the city's Mayor Andriy Sadovyi.
A playground in the city was hit by a rocket, Mr Sadovyi said, which left a 9m (29ft 5in) deep and 20m (65ft 5in) wide crater behind.
He added that four people were injured, but none were in life-threatening conditions.
Describing the incident, local resident Dmytro Ivaschyshyn told Reuters: ""The children hid in the bathroom... They were hysterical, they were shaking"".
Debris from rockets also damaged two farm buildings in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, the deputy head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office, Oleksiy Kuleba, said.
Closer to the front line, a commercial building was hit in the south-eastern region of Dnipropetrovsk overnight.
Two people were killed and another was injured in Kramatorsk - in the eastern Donetsk region - the city council said in a statement.
He added that villages in the Zaporizhzhia and Cherkasy regions were also hit by strikes, which targeted an educational institution, residential buildings and a medical facility.
Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Western Ukraine, which borders Nato-member Poland to its west, has typically seen fewer attacks than the country's eastern and southern regions.
But in July, 10 people were killed and many more were injured after a Russian rocket hit an apartment building in Lviv.

Trump and 18 others charged in Georgia election inquiry,"Former US President Donald Trump has been charged with attempting to overturn his 2020 election defeat in the state of Georgia.
It is the fourth criminal case brought against him in five months.
Mr Trump, who is the leading Republican candidate for president in 2024, was indicted along with 18 other allies.
He denies all 13 charges against him, which include racketeering and election meddling. He has said they are politically motivated.
Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis first launched an investigation in February 2021 into allegations of election meddling against Mr Trump and his associates.
In a 98-page indictment made public late on Monday, prosecutors listed 41 charges against the 19 defendants.
Ms Willis announced she was giving defendants the opportunity to voluntarily surrender no later than noon on Friday 25 August. She said she plans to try all 19 accused together.
The list of alleged co-conspirators includes former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former White House lawyer John Eastman.
Others include a former justice department official, Jeffrey Clark, and Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis - two Trump lawyers who amplified unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.
The indictment says the defendants ""knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favour of Trump"".
The former president is accused of felony counts including:
The indictment refers to the defendants as a ""criminal organisation"", accusing them of other crimes including influencing witnesses, computer trespass, theft and perjury.
The most serious charge, violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico) Act, is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison. 
The act - designed to help take down organised criminal syndicates like the mafia - helps prosecutors connect the dots between underlings who broke laws and those who gave them orders. 
In a statement, the Trump campaign described the district attorney as a ""rabid partisan"" who had filed ""these bogus indictments"" to interfere with the 2024 presidential race and ""damage the dominant Trump campaign"".
""This latest co-ordinated strike by a biased prosecutor in an overwhelmingly Democrat jurisdiction not only betrays the trust of the American people, but also exposes the true motivation driving their fabricated accusations,"" said the statement.
He is the first former president in US history to face criminal charges.

Watch: 'I make decisions based on the facts and the law.'
Earlier this month, Mr Trump was charged by federal prosecutors in Washington DC with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, which he lost to President Joe Biden, a Democrat. 
That charge sheet devoted significant time to the Trump team's activities in Georgia. Mr Trump has pleaded not guilty in that case.
Ms Willis' investigation focuses specifically on Georgia, a key battleground state for the US presidency that Mr Trump narrowly lost.  
In January 2021, Mr Trump was recorded on a phone call asking Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ""find"" 11,780 votes - the number he would have required to beat Mr Biden in that state. 
The indictment outlines an alleged scheme to tamper with voting machines in one Georgia county and steal data.
It also mentions an alleged scheme to submit false lists of electors, officials who make up the Electoral College that elects the president and vice-president.
Mr Raffensperger released a statement following the indictment, saying: ""The most basic principles of a strong democracy are accountability and respect for the Constitution and rule of law. You either have it, or you don't."" 
There are key differences between state charges such as those in Georgia and federal ones. Significantly, if Mr Trump were to become president again in 2024, he would not have the power to pardon himself from state charges.
Mr Trump also faces a New York state trial on 25 March next year involving a hush money payment to a porn star. And he is due to go on trial in Florida on 20 May on allegations related to his handling of classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago residence after his presidency. 
In both cases Mr Trump also pleaded not guilty.

Afghanistan: How many people has the UK resettled?,"Two years after the Taliban took Kabul, a think tank has criticised the UK's treatment of people escaping from Afghanistan.
More in Common said some had been living in hotels for two years, and now faced eviction.
The government says that around 24,600 people had arrived in the UK from Afghanistan as of the end of March 2023, including British nationals. 
Of these, about 21,000 have been resettled under different schemes.
Most came as part of Operation Pitting, the British military operation to evacuate British nationals and Afghans from Kabul which began in August 2021. 
In written evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee in November 2021, Raphael Marshall - who previously worked on the Foreign Office's Afghanistan crisis response - estimated that between 75,000 and 150,000 people had applied for evacuation in August 2021, of whom 5% received assistance. 
The Home Office said another 1,400 former staff and their families had already been relocated since 2013 under an earlier scheme.
In April 2021 - before the Taliban took control of Afghanistan - the government launched the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) scheme. 
Under ARAP, Afghans who worked for the British military and UK government - for example, as interpreters - could apply to settle permanently in the UK, rather than get five years' residency, which was previously offered.
The government also opened the Afghan Citizens' Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) in January 2022, which it said would allow up to 20,000 refugees to settle in the UK.
This scheme focuses on women and children as well as religious and other minorities in danger from the Taliban.
Immediate family members of those eligible under either the ARAP or ACRS schemes are also eligible for resettlement in the UK.
As part of an initiative called ""Operation Warm Welcome"", local councils have been allocated funding packages of £20,520 per person over three years. 
The money should help refugees enrol in education, find work and integrate in their new communities. 
The government promised an additional £10m in the first year for housing costs, then £5m and £2m in the two following years. 
The government announced £35m to help local authorities move around 8,000 Afghans out of hotels and into permanent homes across the UK. It promised a further £250m for the local authority housing fund. 
The refugees were given three months to vacate their hotels for relocation.
At the end of March 2023, the Home Office said that just under 1,000 refugees had been moved into permanent accommodation, and another 468 were waiting to move in.
However, 8,799 Afghan refugees were still living in hotels or serviced accommodation, with one man telling the BBC he had spent almost two years in a hotel. 
According to the Home Office, 315 households (around 1,200 people) refused accommodation offers for ""varied and often justifiable reasons"".
Cabinet Office minister Johnny Mercer - who served in Afghanistan during his time in the military - told the BBC that ""things could always have been done differently"", and that some Afghan families had been in hotels ""for far too long"".
In February 2022, the Home Office said that accommodating Afghan refugees in hotels cost £1.2m per day.
In theory, they can come through the UK Resettlement Scheme which prioritises refugees from regions in conflict. In 2022, 36 Afghans came through this route.
Some Afghans have also made their way to the UK and then sought asylum. 
The number of Afghans arriving in the UK on small boats, which have crossed the English Channel has increased sharply: 
In the first three months of 2023, 1,054 arrived this way. 
Home Office statistics show that nearly 11,000 Afghans and their dependents applied for asylum in 2022. 
However, the Illegal Migration Bill, which became law in July 2023, means anyone arriving illegally may be detained and removed either to Rwanda, or another so-called ""safe"" third country.
There are continuing legal challenges to the Rwanda policy.  
The US evacuated the largest number of people from Afghanistan after the Taliban seized power. 
From 14 August to 28 August 2021, it got 113,500 people out.
Other countries evacuated much smaller numbers over that period, according to official statements and press releases:
Since August 2021, some countries have continued to carry out occasional evacuations. On December 3 of that year, France said that it had evacuated 258 people from Afghanistan. 
There was also an increase in the number of Afghans who applied for asylum in some EU countries such as Greece, France and Germany.

Suspected spies for Russia held in major UK security investigation,"Three suspected spies for Russia in the UK have been arrested and charged in a major national security investigation, the BBC can reveal. 
The defendants, all Bulgarian nationals, were held in February and have been remanded in custody since.
They are charged with possessing identity documents with ""improper intention"", and are alleged to have had these knowing they were fake.
It is alleged they were working for the Russian security services. 
The documents include passports, identity cards and other documents for the UK, Bulgaria, France, Italy, Spain, Croatia, Slovenia, Greece, and the Czech Republic. 
The trio were among five people arrested in February on suspicion of an offence under the Official Secrets Act. 
They were held by counter-terrorism detectives from the Metropolitan Police, which has national policing responsibility for espionage, and are due to answer police bail in September.
Three of them were charged later in February with an offence under the Identity Documents Act. 
They are:
They remain in custody and are due to appear at the Old Bailey at a later date.
The trio have lived in the UK for years, working in a variety of jobs, and living in a series of suburban properties.
Mr Roussev has history of business dealings in Russia.
He moved to the UK in 2009 and spent three years working in a technical role in financial services. 
His online LinkedIn profile states he later owned a business involved in signals intelligence, which involves the interception of communications or electronic signals.
Mr Roussev, whose most recent address is a seaside guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, also states he once acted as an adviser to the Bulgarian ministry of energy.
In Harrow, former neighbours described Mr Dzhambazov and Ms Ivanova as a couple.
Mr Dzhambazov is described as a driver for hospitals, and Ms Ivanova describes herself on her online LinkedIn profile as a laboratory assistant for a private health business.
The pair, who moved to the UK around a decade ago, ran a community organisation providing services to Bulgarian people, including familiarising them with the ""culture and norms of British society"". 
According to Bulgarian state documents online, they also worked for electoral commissions in London which facilitate voting in Bulgarian elections by citizens living abroad.
Speaking to the BBC, neighbours at two houses previously occupied by the couple said they brought round pies and cakes as gifts.
At their most recent Harrow home, neighbours said detectives spent a significant amount of time searching it, with a visible police presence for over a week.
The three defendants are due to go on trial at the Old Bailey in London in January. They have yet to enter pleas to the charges.
Counter-terrorism police have spoken publicly about the increasing amount of time spent on suspected state threats and espionage, especially relating to Russia.
Their concern follows notorious incidents from recent years involving Russian intelligence operations in the UK.
In 2018, Russian operatives attempted to murder former double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, Wiltshire, using the deadly nerve agent Novichok. The pair, as well as responding detective Nick Bailey, were treated in hospital and could have died.
Later that year, local woman Dawn Sturgess - who was unconnected to the Skripals - died after being exposed to the nerve agent, which had been left in Wiltshire in a perfume bottle.
In 2006, former Russian-intelligence officer Alexander Litvinenko was killed in London after being poisoned by assassins working for the Russian state.

"Afghanistan refugees being let down by UK, says think tank","Many Afghan refugees have been ""let down"" by the UK, with some living in hotels for up to two years and now facing eviction, a think tank has said. 
More in Common said lessons needed to be learned so future refugees were better supported.
It comes on the anniversary of the UK's evacuation programme and the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on 15 August 2021. 
Minister Johnny Mercer admitted there had been ""challenges"" but said he was determined to make Afghan schemes work.
Operation Pitting saw the UK airlift around 15,000 people out of Kabul - including British nationals, as well as people who worked with the UK in Afghanistan and their family members. 
Those who had nowhere to live were placed in government-funded hotels. This was supposed to be temporary accommodation but by the end of March, there were still around 8,800 Afghans living in hotels. 
The government has imposed a deadline of the end of August for Afghans to be moved out of hotels, but councils have warned some are facing homelessness as they cannot find anywhere else to live. 
More In Common, an organisation founded in the wake of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox, surveyed 132 Afghans in the UK.
It was told of failures in communication with local authorities and the Home Office on housing, rental applications being repeatedly rejected, and unsuitable homes being offered, sometimes hundreds of miles away.
One example saw a refugee living in temporary accommodation in Bristol, where they had family, offered permanent housing in Northern Ireland. 
Amir Hussain Ibrahimi was evacuated from Afghanistan by the UK two years ago and has been living in a hotel in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, ever since. 
The 24-year-old, who was a journalist and photographer in Afghanistan, said he was forced to leave his family behind after he was arrested and attacked by the Taliban.
""The first days when I was in the hotel we had a lot of promises - the government told us that you're going to stay three months or four months or five months,"" he told BBC News.
""It is quite hard because you don't know what is the next step for your life.""
""Sometimes you want to feel a place is like a home,"" he said, adding that he had felt depressed at times since coming to the UK. 
Mr Ibrahimi said he was relieved the council had finally found him a permanent home, after being rejected by more than 10 landlords. He is now waiting to see if this landlord will accept him as a tenant.
However, he said he knew many other families who had not managed to find homes. 
Mr Ibrahimi acknowledged there were challenges as other Afghans did not have experience working in the UK and often had large families. However, he said the government needed to do more to help. 
Cabinet Office minister Mr Mercer, who served in Afghanistan during his time in the military and is responsible for the resettlement scheme, acknowledged ""things could always have been done differently"" and that Afghan families had been in hotels ""for far too long"". 
He told the PA news agency the deadline for people to leave hotels by the end of August had been ""a controversial move"" but it was done ""with compassion in mind"". 
He said 440 Afghans had been matched to homes in the past week ""and I couldn't have generated that momentum without putting that hard deadline in there"".
The government said it had provided £285m of funding to help move Afghans into permanent homes, with more than 10,500 people moved from hotels to long-term accommodation so far. 
A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said councils had worked ""incredibly hard"" to support Afghan families but had faced challenges including a shortage of housing. 
It accepted there were lessons to be learned but blamed a ""delay in funding and guidance from government for creating a lot of uncertainty"". 
Sir Laurie Bristow, who was the UK's ambassador to Afghanistan when Kabul fell to the Taliban, said Britain has a responsibility to those who worked for the UK there. 
""There are people in Afghanistan and in refugee camps who worked for us and worked with us and whose lives are in danger as a result of doing so,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. 
As debate continues over whether countries should engage with the Taliban, Sir Laurie said that doing so effectively could help to address reasons why Afghans were leaving the country for the UK. 
Meanwhile, charities have criticised resettlement schemes for being too slow and leaving many people who want to come to the UK stuck in Afghanistan. 
Since the original evacuation, the numbers arriving under the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) have been low, with only 40 refugees who have fled Afghanistan to neighbouring countries being resettled in the UK up to the end of March, while only 14 members of at-risk groups have been resettled directly from Afghanistan. 
A further 9,059 people, who arrived in the UK under Operation Pitting, have also been resettled under the ACRS, while 11,398 have been brought to the UK under a scheme for Afghans who worked for or with the UK government.
In the meantime others have taken dangerous routes like crossing the Channel in small boats, with Afghan the most common nationality recorded among those arriving this way so far this year.
Human rights organisation Justice said the schemes had been marked by ""significant delays, lack of transparency and lack of consistency"". 
It called for quicker processing times and better communication with applicants. 
Mr Mercer acknowledged some people had been left behind after the Taliban takeover and had still not been brought to safety. 
However, he said he was determined to make resettlement schemes ""work properly"" and that the UK should be ""proud"" of its efforts to rescue people. 
A Home Office spokesperson said the UK had made ""one of the largest commitments of any country to support Afghanistan"" and there was ""no need for Afghans to risk their lives by taking dangerous and illegal journeys"".

Barbie banned from Algerian cinemas for 'corrupting morals',"Algeria has banned the popular Barbie film three weeks after its release in the mainly Muslim North African nation.
The culture ministry has asked cinemas to withdraw the Hollywood blockbuster immediately.
The movie promoted homosexuality and did not comply with Algeria's religious and cultural beliefs, an official source told the Reuters news agency.
Cinemas in the cities of Algiers, Oran and Constantine have been packed, according to 24H Algérie news website.
The film was officially being banned for ""damaging morals"", the privately owned news website said, adding that since its release viewings had sold out every day.
There has been criticism in the Arab world about the movie's social values, with Kuwait banning Barbie last week to protect ""public ethics"".
The film, starring Hollywood A-listers Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, is a coming-of-age story based on the children's toy, where Barbie journeys to the real world and explores her identity.
Around the time of the film's release, director Greta Gerwig told the New York Times that it was supposed to be ""funny"" and that her hope for the movie was for society to ""let go of the things that aren't necessarily serving us as either women or men"".
Barbie has received a warmer welcome from leaders in other countries, such as the UK and Spain, where British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Spanish royal family were pictured on cinema outings to see it.
Since the movie's release it has grossed more than $1bn (£786m) worldwide.

Afghanistan country profile,"Landlocked and mountainous, Afghanistan has suffered from such chronic instability and conflict during its modern history that its economy and infrastructure are in ruins, and many of its people are refugees.
The Taliban, who imposed strict Islamic rule following a devastating civil war, were ousted by a US-led invasion in 2001, but made a rapid comeback to take over almost all of the country after US forces left in 2021. 
Though the war ended with the Taliban takeover, there are attacks on the Taliban by Islamic State, as well as an anti-Taliban insurgency in some areas.
Taliban leader : Hibatullah Akhundzada
Hibatullah Akhundzada became the supreme commander of the Taliban in 2016, and is now head of state of the interim government in Kabul, called the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
He fought in the resistance to the Soviet military occupation in the 1980s, and went on to lead the Islamic courts during the Taliban's last period in government in 1996-2001.
Afghan media have faced difficulties since the Taliban took power in Kabul in August 2021.
Outlets have endured severe restrictions, an economic crisis and waning Western support.
There is growing self-censorship and editorial appeasement of the Taliban. Freedom of expression has largely disappeared.
Some key dates in Afghanistan's history: 
18th Century - The modern state of Afghanistan begins with Ahmad Shah Durrani (ruled 1747-1772) and the Durrani Afghan Empire that at its maximum encompasses northern India and eastern Iran.
1826 - With the decline of Durrani dynasty Dost Mohammad Khan Barakzai becomes Emir of Afghanistan.
1839-42 - First Anglo-Afghan War: British initially successfully invade, deposing Dost Mohammad and replacing him with the former emir Shah Shujah but the British forces are almost completely massacred during their retreat.
1878-80 - Second Anglo-Afghan War:  British invade forcing Amir Sher Ali Khan to flee. Ali's successor signs a peace treaty but after the massacre of a British diplomatic mission fighting restarts. The Afghans defeat a British force at the Battle of Maiwand but the British decisively defeat the Afghans outside Kandahar to end the war. 
1893 - Durand Line established as the border between British India and the Emirate of Afghanistan by British diplomat Mortimer Durand and Afghan Emir Abdur Rahman Khan. However, the exact line of the border remain remains disputed. 
1919 - Third Anglo-Afghan War: Afghanistan invades British India. Peace treaty results in Afghanistan gaining control of its foreign affairs from Britain.
1926 - Emir Amanullah Khan declares himself king and the Emirate of Afghanistan becomes the Kingdom of Afghanistan.
1928-29 - Afghan civil war: Facing armed opposition to his reforms, King Amanullah abdicates. Kabul is temporarily captured by opposition forces, who are defeated by Prince Mohammed Nadir Shah, Amanullah's cousin.
1933 - King Nadir Shah adopts more gradual approach to modernization, but is assassinated. Mohammed Zahir Shah reigns as king from 1933 to 1973, pursuing a policy of neutrality.
1973 - Mohammed Daoud Khan deposes the king in a bloodless coup and becomes Afghanistan's first president.
1978 - Communists under Nur Muhammad Taraki seize power in a coup against President Mohammed Daoud Khan. They start land distribution reforms and oppress political dissent, provoking strong opposition which quickly expands into civil war.
1979 - Taraki is assassinated in a power struggle led by then-prime minister Hafizullah Amin. Displeased with Amin's government, the Soviet Union invades, capturing Kabul and killing Amin, installing a more complaint communist regime.
1979-89 - Soviet-Afghan War: Soviet troops in substantial numbers are sent to stabilize Afghanistan marking the beginning of a bitter war. 
The US and Pakistan send military aid to resistance groups. Between 560,000 and two million Afghans are killed, six million become refugees. 
1989 - Soviet forces leave and Afghanistan collapses into renewed civil war. Some 400,000 Afghans are estimated to have been killed between 1990-2001.
1996 - Taliban seize control of Kabul and impose hard-line version of Islam.
2001-2021 - War in Afghanistan: The United States, including Nato and other allies intervene militarily following September 11 attacks on the US. The Taliban are ousted from Kabul and Hamid Karzai becomes head of an interim power-sharing government. 
The war becomes the United States' longest military engagement as the Taliban regroup and regain control of large areas of the countryside.  
2014 - Nato formally ends its combat mission in Afghanistan, handing over to Afghan forces - supported by US troops - who face a growing insurgency. Between 176,000-212,000 people are killed in the 20-year war.
2020 - Unable to defeat the Taliban militarily, the US and Taliban sign the Doha Agreement: US troops will withdraw, in return for which Afghan territory will not be used for militant attacks against the US and its allies.
2021 - Taliban recapture Kabul after US forces withdraw.

How is the UK stopping Channel crossings and what are the legal routes to the UK?,"Asylum seekers have been taken off the Bibby Stockholm barge in Dorset after Legionella bacteria was discovered on board. 
The accommodation is part of the government's plan to deal with the large numbers of people arriving in the UK on small boats. 
In April 2023, the government announced that a barge called the Bibby Stockholm would host up to 500 adult male asylum seekers off the coast of Portland, Dorset. 
The barge received its first 39 occupants in early August after delays due to fire safety concerns.
On 11 August, they were all removed after Legionella bacteria was found in the water system. The bacteria can cause Legionnaires disease, a type of pneumonia.
Earlier, in March 2023, the government said that three ex-military sites in Essex, Lincolnshire and East Sussex would house several thousand migrants:
Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire is also due to open soon, but the government has not yet said how many people could be housed there. 
Forty six asylum seekers have arrived at the Wethersfield site. An unspecified number of residents subsequently tested positive for tuberculosis (TB). 
The first asylum seekers were expected to arrive at Scampton in mid-August, but this has been delayed until October 2023.
West Lindsey District Council and Braintree District Council have been given permission to bring a judicial review contesting the use of Scampton and Wethersfield. 
The Home Office is also reported to be considering using tents to accommodate asylum seekers. 
At the end of March 2023 there were more than 47,000 asylum seekers living in hotels across the UK, and the government hopes its alternative accommodation plans will save money. 
A Home Office official told a committee of MPs that the department was also paying to keep nearly 5,000 hotel beds empty to prevent overcrowding at detention centres.
Under the Illegal Migration Bill, which passed in July 2023: 
Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper says the legislation ""fails to tackle the criminal smuggler gangs, and makes it easier for traffickers"". 
She added that the lack of returns agreements with other countries ""will just increase the asylum backlog with even more people in costly hotels"".
The government has also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay £500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. 
The Home Office insists there are a number of ""safe and legal"" routes to the UK. 
However, some are restricted to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, while other routes only accept limited numbers. Figures shown are for the year to March 2023:
In April 2023, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick was asked in Parliament which safe and legal routes were available to a young person wanting to flee the conflict in Sudan. 
He said individuals should contact the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR. But it insisted ""there is no mechanism through which refugees can approach UNHCR with the intention of seeking asylum in the UK"".
Critics of the government's asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they risk breaking international law. 
The main principle of the 1951 Refugee Convention states that refugees should not be returned to countries where they faced threats to life or freedom. 
The government insists its plan to send migrants to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be heard complies with international law. 
But the Court of Appeal ruled in June 2023 that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful and risks breaching Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
The government is taking the case to the Supreme Court. 
Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government's ""safe and legal"" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.

'You're kind of raised to hate tourists': Maui fires fan tensions on Hawaiian island,"After wildfires devastated parts of the Hawaiian island of Maui, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the US, officials warned visitors to stay away. But thousands remained and others continued to fly in, angering residents in the wake of the tragedy.
At Maui's Wailea Beach on Monday the skies were bright and clear. Luxury hotels lined the beachfront, their guests spread on the sand. Some waded in the ocean, while others sat under umbrellas with white monogrammed towels on their chairs.  
Inside one of the hotels, beyond a pool, a two-tiered fountain and a glass-walled habitat for the resident parrot, was a wooden-framed screen advertising a relief fund for the resort's employees - the first sign of the destruction in Lahaina, just 30 miles (48km) up the coast.
In the wake of the wildfires, the deadliest in modern US history, frustration at tourists who have chosen to carry on with their holidays has grown. Many in Maui say the devastation has highlighted what is known as the ""two Hawaiis"" - one built for the comfort of visitors and another, harsher Hawaii left to Hawaiians. 
""It's all butterflies and rainbows when it comes to the tourism industry,"" said a 21-year-old Maui native and an employee at the hotel who asked to remain anonymous. ""But what's really under it is kind of scary."" 
Last Wednesday, a day after the wildfires, the county asked visitors to leave Lahaina and the island as a whole as soon as possible. 
Officials soon urged people to avoid the island entirely, except for essential travel. ""In the days and weeks ahead, our collective resources and attention must be focused on the recovery of residents and communities that were forced to evacuate,"" the Hawaii Tourism Authority said.
Many travellers heeded the advice. In the immediate aftermath of the fires, some 46,000 people left the island. The grass field separating the airport from the surrounding highway is now lined with rows upon rows of suddenly surplus rental cars.
But thousands did not. Some ignored requests to leave Maui immediately, while others flew in after the fire - decisions that have angered some.
""If this was happening to your hometown, would you want us to come?"" said resident Chuck Enomoto. ""We need to take care of our own first."" 
Another Maui local told the BBC that tourists were swimming in the ""same waters that our people died in three days ago"" - an apparent reference to a snorkelling excursion on Friday just 11 miles from Lahaina.
The snorkelling company later apologised for running the tour, saying it had first ""offered our vessel throughout the week to deliver supplies and rescue people but its design wasn't appropriate for the task"". 
But the opposition to tourists is not without complications given the island is economically reliant on those travellers. The Maui Economic Development Board has estimated that the island's ""visitor industry"" accounts for roughly four out of every five dollars generated here, calling those visitors the ""economic engine"" of the county. 
""You're kind of raised to hate tourists,"" said the young hotel worker. ""But that's really the only way to work on the islands. If it's not hospitality then it's construction."" 
Several business owners expressed concern that the growing anti-tourist sentiment could hurt Maui further. 
""What I'm afraid of is that if people keep seeing 'Maui's closed', and 'don't come to Maui', what little business is left is going to be gone,"" said Daniel Kalahiki, who owns a food truck in Wailuku. Sales have already dropped by 50% since the fire, he said. ""And then the island is going to lose everything.""
Still, in the days after the fire, the disparity between Maui residents - reeling from catastrophic loss - and the insulated tourist hotspots has been laid bare. 
In one Hawaii, locals face an acute housing crisis. Many live in modest one-storey homes in neighbourhoods like Kahului and Kīhei, some in multi-family dwellings, with each family separated by a curtain or a thin plywood wall.
And working a number of jobs is common, locals told the BBC, to keep up with rising costs. Jen Alcantara shrugged off surprise that she worked for a Canadian airline in addition to a senior administrative position at Maui's hospital. ""That's Hawaii,"" she said. 
In this Hawaii, the effects of the fires are everywhere. At shops and grocery stores, evacuees look for essentials, trying to replace their lost possessions with whatever money they have. At restaurants, workers can be seen in kitchens and behind bars holding back tears and making phone calls to co-ordinate relief efforts. 
Here, collections were being taken for the survivors nearly everywhere you look. An upscale coffee shop in Kahului was offering to refrigerate donated breast milk. Food truck owners were volunteering their services to the front line and farmers were carrying bunches of bananas to shelters.
Things are different in the other Hawaii. 
As you reach the end of the 30-minute drive from the island's urban centre to Wailea, home to Maui's high-end holiday rentals and resorts, the earth suddenly changes, dry brown grasses become a rich, watered green.  
""It's a blunt line,"" one local said, another hotel employee who did not want to be named. 
Inside Wailea, gated communities border golf courses, that are connected to luxury hotels. Inside those hotels, obliging staff provide surf lessons and pool-side meals, including a $29 burger. 
Staff told the BBC that many of the guests were sympathetic to the crisis on the west of the island. Others had complained about scheduled activities in Lahaina - horse-riding, ziplining - being cancelled, said Brittany Pounder, 34, an employee at the Four Seasons. 
The day after the fires, one guest visiting from California, asked if he could still get to his dinner reservation at the Lahaina Grill - a restaurant in one of the hardest-hit areas of the town. ""It's not OK,"" Ms Pounder said. 
There is mounting concern that the eventual rebuild of Lahaina will further cater to this second Hawaii. 
Already, wealthy visitors have contributed to exorbitant house prices, buying land and property in a place where homeownership is out of reach for many permanent residents. Famous billionaires Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos both have homes in Maui. Oprah Winfrey is the island's largest landowner. 
Rumours have spread of estate agents approaching Hawaiian property owners in Lahaina, asking about possible deals. 
Several locals told the BBC they worried Lahaina would be refashioned into another Waikiki, the ritzy waterfront of Honolulu, dominated by oceanfront high-rises and branded luxury shopping.
""We don't need another Waikiki,"" said Chuck Enomoto. ""But it's inevitable.""

Second Ecuador politician killed in less than a week,"A local party leader has been killed in Ecuador, the second politician to be assassinated in the space of a week. 
Pedro Briones was shot dead by gunmen on a motorcycle at his home in northern Esmeraldas province.
His killing comes just five days after presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was gunned down in the capital, Quito.
Ecuador's murder rate has surged as local gangs have forged alliances with international crime cartels. 
The killings of politicians have rocked the country ahead of snap presidential elections on 20 August. 
Mr Briones was a leader of the left-wing Citizen Revolution Party in Esmeraldas. Fellow members of the party expressed their condolences to his family.
The party's presidential candidate, Luisa González, said that Ecuador was going through ""its bloodiest period"".
Former president Rafael Correa, who founded the Citizen Revolution Party, wrote: ""They murdered another of our colleagues in Esmeraldas. Enough is enough!""
Police have not yet officially commented on the murder but local media reported that the two gunmen had fled on a motorbike after shooting dead Mr Briones in San Mateo, south of the city of Esmeraldas.
It is not yet clear what the possible motive may have been. 
Esmeraldas province, on the border with Colombia, has been one of the worst hit by the wave of violence which has spread across the country. 
Its porous border with Colombia and its location on the Pacific coast makes the province attractive to drug smugglers who traffic cocaine from Colombia through Ecuador to the US and Europe. 
But the violence has not been contained to Esmeraldas. Last month, the mayor of the port city of Manta in Manabí province was shot dead as he was inspecting a public works project.
The highest-profile victim so far has been Fernando Villavicencio, an outspoken journalist who had uncovered corruption scandals and denounced links between organised crime and government officials. 
Six men have been arrested in connection with his assassination, all of them Colombian citizens. 
FBI agents arrived in the country from the US on Sunday and have joined forces with Ecuadorean police to investigate Fernando Villavicencio's murder.

Russia hikes interest rates to 12% as rouble falls,"Russia has hiked interest rates to 12% after the rouble fell to its lowest value in 16 months.
The currency fell past 100 per dollar on Monday, prompting Russia's central bank to hold an emergency meeting.
The Bank of Russia said it decided to raise interest rates from 8.5% to curb inflation, which hit 4.4% in August.
Pressure has been mounting on the Russian economy due to imports rising faster than exports and military spending growing for the Ukraine war.
""Steady growth in domestic demand surpassing the capacity to expand output amplifies the underlying inflationary pressure and has impact on the rouble's exchange rate dynamics through elevated demand for imports,"" the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
The bank said ""inflationary pressure"" was building, but that its target was to bring inflation, which is the rate prices rise at, down to 4% by 2024.
Russia has been targeted with sanctions by Western countries following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
The rouble plummeted after war first broke out, but was bolstered by capital controls and oil and gas exports.
However, it has lost about a quarter of its value overall against the US dollar since Ukraine was invaded and this week more than 100 roubles was needed to buy one dollar.
On Tuesday, the currency recovered slightly to 98 roubles to the dollar, but it remains much weaker than it was last year.
It is not the first time the Bank of Russia has been aggressive with interest rate hikes. When Russia first attacked Ukraine the bank raised rates from 9.5% to 20%, but began cutting them shortly afterwards.
But the latest hike will only have a temporary impact, according to Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
""Russia will struggle to attract capital inflows because of sanctions,"" he said.
Analysts have said a major factor in the rouble weakening has been Russia's trade, and therefore its economy, being hit by Western sanctions.
Since the outbreak of war, many EU countries which relied on Russian oil and gas have pledged to wean themselves off imports from the country and find alternative suppliers.
EU leaders introduced a price cap plan to limit the amount Russia earns from its oil exports and the country has also been excluded from Swift, an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions.

At least 35 die in inferno at petrol station in Dagestan southern Russia,"This video can not be played
Watch: Explosions at petrol station in Russia’s south
At least 35 people have been killed and dozens injured in an explosion at a petrol station in southern Russia.
The blast occurred in the Dagestan regional capital, Makhachkala, on the coast of the Caspian Sea, at 21:40 local time (18:40 GMT) on Monday. 
Pictures showed a large fire lighting up the night sky and a number of fire engines at the scene.
According to local media, the fire began at a car repair centre near the petrol station.
Russian President Vladimir Putin offered his sincere condolences following the deadly blast.
A state of emergency was introduced in the Kumtorkalinsky district in Dagestan, according to regional head Sergei Melikov.
Some 260 emergency workers have been deployed, while the most seriously injured have been evacuated to Moscow by air, according to the emergencies ministry. 
Rescue operations are ongoing, the ministry said. As emergency services clear through the rubble, more bodies are being discovered. 
Russia's Interfax news agency quoted doctors as saying three children were among the dead.
It added that the fire had spread over an area of 600 sq m (6,460 sq ft) and that there was a danger of further explosions. 
An unnamed witness quoted by Russian newspaper Izvestia said the fire had started at a car park opposite the petrol station. 
""After the explosion, everything fell on our heads. We couldn't see anything any more,"" the witness said. 
Russia's Investigative Committee said the fire had broken out during some car maintenance work and had been ""followed by a bang"".
A criminal case has been opened to establish the circumstances leading up to the incident, the committee said. 
The Republic of Dagestan is one of 83 constituent parts of the Russian Federation and is the southernmost part of the country. Makhachkala is about 1,600km (1,000 miles) from Moscow.

Oakham to keep twinning link with German town,"Oakham's 37-year twinning relationship with the German town of Barmstedt is to continue, a council has voted.
Councillors in the Rutland town said while pairing UK towns to continental counterparts had dwindled, Barmstedt residents were keen to maintain the arrangement.
The two locations have been paired since 1987 but an external co-ordinator is stepping down.
Now Oakham Town Council says it will ""carry the flag"" at no extra cost.
In recent years, twinning arrangements between British town and foreign locations have been in decline.
The town council explained that it wanted to ensure its relationship was retained, with ""the only real commitment"" being to assign a point of contact and keeping up correspondence.
At a full council meeting the authority voted unanimously that councillors Adam Lowe and Paul Ainsley would become twinning representatives, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 
Mr Lowe said it would be ""a shame"" to discontinue Oakham's link to Barmstedt, which is located in the norther German district of Pinneberg and has a walkway named Oakham Promenade at one of its parks.
The council said it also had heard from its residents who were ""very keen that Oakham stay in touch"".
Mr Lowe explained: ""I have looked into this matter to see what the cost implications are, and the simple answer is that there aren't any, because in the original documents when they formed the twinning relationship it was written that Oakham Town Council would not be expected to put money into it.""
Mr Ainsley added: ""I would also like to throw my hat into the ring - I think it would be slightly more robust if we had a couple of people representing the council in twinning matters.""

Italy floods: Torrent of muddy floodwater bursts through alpine town,"This video can not be played
More than 100 people have been displaced after the Merdovine River unexpectedly burst its banks, covering the town of Bardonecchia in thick mud.
The flood was likely triggered when heavy rain caused a mountain stream to overflow, leading to a landslide.
There were no deaths or missing people, Italian news agency ANSA reported on Monday. 
However, the damage to the town was substantial - with 120 people displaced.
Several people also had to be rescued from a camper van, fire and rescue officials said.

Ugandan Asian anniversary artwork to be installed in Leicester,"A new public artwork commemorating the 50th anniversary of fleeing Ugandan Asians arriving in Leicester will be installed later this summer.
More than 27,000 Asians were abruptly expelled by Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in 1972 and thousands settled in the city.
Artists were invited to submit designs for the artwork last year, and sculptor Anuradha Patel was selected.
She is herself a Ugandan Asian of Gujarati origin.
""I feel enormously privileged to have been awarded the Ugandan Asian 50th anniversary commission,"" she said.
""Not only is it so relevant to my own history and experience, but it has brought me closer to the communities in Leicester with whom I share so many of the same or similar experiences of upheaval and resettlement.
""Now that we are approaching completion, I am both excited and nervous. It has been a lengthy process over the past year to realise the artwork.""
The sculpture, entitled Structural Gateway, is due to be installed on Belgrave Roundabout later this summer, and will form an archway welcoming visitors to Belgrave.
Planning permission was granted earlier this year, and groundworks are beginning on site ahead of the planned installation work.
The project is costing about £200,000 in total.
Adam Clarke, Leicester's deputy city mayor for climate, economy and culture, said: ""The story of Leicester's Ugandan Asians isn't something from the distant past - it is well within the living memory of so many people in the city and has profoundly shaped our communities and our culture over the last half a century.
""The resilience shown by people 50 years ago when faced with upheaval, desperation and danger is sadly still just as relevant today, and this artwork is chance to reflect upon that as well as celebrating the rich diversity brought by the city's Ugandan Asian community.""

Independence Day: PM Modi says India stands with Manipur,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government was making every effort to restore peace in the state of Manipur as he addressed the country on its 77th independence day.
""I want to tell the people of Manipur that the country is with you,"" Mr Modi said.
On Tuesday, he unfurled the national flag at the historic Red Fort in Delhi.
In a speech televised live, he talked about natural disasters, the economy and India's growing population.
On Manipur, the prime minister said that a lasting resolution could only be found through peace.
""In the last few weeks, Manipur witnessed a wave of violence. Several people lost their lives and our mothers and sisters were dishonoured,"" he said.  
The state has witnessed violent clashes which broke out in May between the majority Meitei group and the tribal Kuki minority.
More than 140 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced in the violence. A viral video of an attack in May when two Kuki women were paraded naked by Meitei men shortly after their village was razed sparked outrage and made global headlines. 
Mr Modi was criticised for not speaking on Manipur for weeks during the violence.
""Manipur has been peaceful for the last few days,"" he said on Tuesday. ""The state and the federal governments are working to ensure this continues.""
His speech came days after his government defeated a no-trust vote in the parliament after opposition leaders criticised the government response to the crisis in the state and demanded that he address the house on the ethnic clashes.
In his independence day speech, the prime minister referred to recent reports that said that India had overtaken China to be the world's most populous country with 1.4 billion people.
""Demography, democracy and diversity"" were India's strength and the country's youth would have unlimited opportunities, he added.
The prime minister said India's economy was now the fifth largest in the world and promised that ""in the next five years, we will be in the top three"".
""I am confident that in 2047, when India marks 100 years of its independence, it will be a developed nation,"" he added.
Mr Modi claimed that the country's economic situation post the Covid-19 pandemic was better than most other countries. ""We have been able to control inflation successfully,"" he said. 
His claim though is being questioned as India's middle and lower classes, who make up the bulk of the population, have been hit by skyrocketing prices for essentials in recent months.And official data released on Monday showed retail inflation at a 15-month high of 7.44% in July on the back of a surge in prices of vegetables, cereals and pulses.
The prime minister also touched up the ""unimaginable crisis"" caused by natural calamities in several states this year.
Heavy rainfall has battered the northern state of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh over the past few days. Dozens of people have been killed in flash floods and landslides.
Mr Modi said the state and federal governments would work together to help the affected people rebuild their lives.

Longleat Safari Park osteopath helps develop Asian elephant care,"An osteopath who helps care for a 69-year-old elephant at Longleat Safari Park has led workshops in Thailand about how to care for the animals. 
Keepers from the safari park in Wiltshire travelled to Thailand with renowned Cheltenham osteopath Tony Nevin.
He has been treating Asian elephant Anne for more than a decade after she was rescued from a circus. 
""We've got this whole toolbox of things we can use,"" Mr Nevin said. 
Mr Nevin uses hand massage techniques along with laser work and infra-red imagery to care for Anne, who has been at Longleat since 2011. 
He visits the safari park once a month to look after her, and has taken the skills and insights gained from his time there to teach others how to look after elephants. 
Mr Nevin, whose practise Zoo Ost Ltd is based in Cheltenham, and keepers from Longleat travelled to Chiang Rai in Thailand to led practical workshops with elephant keepers who work across Thailand.
Osteopathy practices with the rescued elephants at the workshop in Thailand saw a marked improvement in their posture and gait over the course of a week.
He said: ""I've been working with Anne ever since she arrived at the park. She had a life in the circus and that involves effectively gymnastics - and just like any person that does gymnastics, particular joints can suffer.
""So as a result with Anne she's got arthritis in her hips and knees and throws more of her weight forward which then creates problems in them,"" he added. 
He said: ""As a species, Asian elephants are really struggling and I was really keen to use the skills I'd built up working with Anne and take those out to Thailand and be able to work with elephants there and teach vets and elephant handlers their the techniques that we use. ""
Longleat's head of animal operations, Darren Beasley, said: ""Anne is hugely intelligent and renowned for being quite the character by all who are lucky enough to spend time with her.""It is a privilege to have been entrusted with her care and we're so pleased that - with Tony's help - we can share the learning and techniques honed at Longleat to provide vital support for her species across the world,"" he added.
Longleat has joined forces with the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the World Elephant Day Foundation to help secure better outcomes for elephants across the world. 
""We are proud that our member safari parks such as Longleat are world-leaders in elephant care,"" said Dr Jo Judge, CEO of BIAZA.""The dedicated work of Tony and the Longleat keepers is a brilliant example of this - sharing the knowledge and skills they have in caring for Anne, can go on to support elephants all across the world. ""

Japan economy gets major boost from weak currency,"Japan's economy grew much faster than expected in the three months to the end of June as the country's weak currency boosted exports.
The world's third largest economy saw its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rise by an annualised 6% in the period.
It is about twice the rate of growth forecast by economists and marks the biggest rise in almost three years.
The fall in the value of the yen helped exporters as Japanese-made goods became cheaper for consumers around the world.
Japan's currency has fallen sharply against major currencies in recent months and is down by more 10% versus the US dollar this year.
""The weak yen is behind the positive GDP numbers,"" Fujitsu's chief economist Martin Schulz told the BBC.
GDP is one of the most important tools for looking at how well, or badly, an economy is doing.It helps businesses judge when to expand and hire more people, and it lets government work out how much to tax and spend.
Profits at the country's car makers - including Toyota, Honda and Nissan - have been boosted in recent months as they saw increased demand for exports.
While a weak currency makes what the country imports more expensive, prices of commodities on global markets, like oil and gas, have fallen in recent months.
That has resulted in a drop in the value of imports, down 4.3% from the previous quarter, which EY's Nobuko Kobayashi called ""a major culprit for GDP growth"".
Japan's economy has also been helped by a rise in tourist numbers after the government lifted border restrictions at the end of April.
As of June, the number of foreign visitors to Japan had recovered to more than 70% of pre-pandemic levels, according to the country's national tourism authority.
Spending by tourists is also expected to give the country's economy an even bigger boost from this month after China lifted a ban on group travel.
Before the pandemic Chinese visitors accounted for more than a third of tourist spending in Japan.
That is helping to offset the impact of the slowing recovery of consumption in the country itself after the pandemic.
""The main difficulty for Japan's second half is, however, that the domestic economy is cooling,"" Mr Schulz said.
According to Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics, the details of the data ""weren't as impressive as the headline.""
He highlighted a number of issues including a fall in private consumption, which makes up more than half of Japan's economy.
Japanese workers have seen their pay go up at the fastest rate in 28 years but with inflation hovering near a four-decade-high wages have been falling in real terms for well over a year.

Hawaii wildfires: Crews may find 10 to 20 wildfire victims a day - governor,"This video can not be played
Watch: ''Thank God that he gave us tears"" - Maui resident
Recovery crews combing through charred homes and vehicles in Hawaii are likely to find 10 to 20 more victims per day, the governor has warned.
The death toll from the fire now stands at 99, making it the deadliest US wildfire in more than a century. 
Governor Josh Green told CBS News it could take up to 10 days to learn the full death toll.
The number of missing now stands at around 1,300, he said. 
He later told a press conference that 25% of the area affected by the fire had been searched for bodies.
Nearly the entire town of Lahaina was destroyed in the fire.
""There is nothing to see except full devastation,"" Mr Green told CBS, the BBC's US news partner, on Sunday.
All residents of Lahaina - home to 12,000 people - probably escaped or perished in the fire, he added. He said crews would probably discover more victims and that it would take time to identify them. 
""It's hard to recognise anybody,"" Mr Green said. 
Officials said 20 dogs trained to search for cadavers had been deployed to the island by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). 
""We've got an area that we have to contain that is at least five square miles, and it is full of our loved ones,"" said Maui Police Chief Jeff Pelletier at a weekend news conference. 
On Monday, Fema Administrator Deanne Criswell declined to give an exact estimate of how long the search and recovery mission would take, calling the situation ""extremely hazardous"".
""The dogs can only work so long because of how hot the temperatures are,"" said Ms Criswell, participating in the White House daily press briefing remotely from Hawaii.  
At one point, there were more than 2,000 people who had been reported missing since the fire broke out on the island of Maui last week. 
That number went down to 1,300 as people were able to reconnect with one another after access to cell phone service improved.
Chief Pelletier has encouraged people with missing family members to submit DNA samples to help with search efforts. 
He also urged patience for those looking to enter the town, as there are still remains that need to be recovered and identified. 
""When we find our family and friends, the remains we're finding is through a fire that melted metal,"" he said. ""We have to do rapid DNA to identify them. Every one of these ... are John and Jane Does.""
Speaking to reporters on Monday afternoon, Mr Green said just under 2,000 housing units, including 402 hotel rooms, had been made available for people who had lost their homes. 
The deadly fire in Lahaina is still burning and is about 85% contained, according to Maui County officials. How the fire started remains unconfirmed, though it was fuelled by winds from nearby Hurricane Dora and drought conditions. 
A class-action lawsuit was filed on Saturday against Hawaii's largest electricity provider, Hawaii Electric, which alleges the company's downed power lines contributed to the wildfires. 
The lawsuit accuses the company of failing to shut off the downed lines despite advanced warning from the National Weather Service cautioning that Hawaii was under high alert for wildfires.
Temporarily shutting off power to reduce fire risk is a tactic used in western US states, where wildfires are common. In California, power lines have been blamed for half of the state's most destructive wildfires.

Ukraine therapist: I've got no weapon but knowledge,"""Whenever the blackouts hit, I automatically start swearing,"" laughs Inna Pochtaruk. 
Expressing yourself this way is a healthy reaction, the 45-year-old says, because ""anger equals energy for action"" and can help us protect personal boundaries. 
As a therapist in Ukraine during the war with Russia, she treats patients suffering grief, guilt, anger, fear, isolation and feelings of powerlessness, but that doesn't mean she herself is immune. 
So she and about a dozen others meet every fortnight over Zoom - wi-fi connections permitting - to offer mutual support and receive free clinical supervision from two therapists based in London, all mediated by a Ukrainian translator called Max. 
""The most difficult thing has been the prolonged, full-scale threat of death,"" says Svetlana Koval, 47, also a therapist. 
The war forced her to flee her hometown and move to the city of Odesa, leaving her elderly mother behind. Although her mother has a support network and Svetlana speaks to her regularly, she still ends each conversation feeling hopeless. 
There are no quick fixes but hobbies, therapy and coping mechanisms help Svetlana through.  
""I've been ballroom dancing for two years,"" she says, smiling. ""But it's a small community with very few men, unfortunately."" Many have been conscripted into the army.
Small joys are far from frivolous in times of hardship, say the therapists. Yoga, gardening and cups of tea are some of their favourite ways to look after themselves - much like anywhere else in the world. 
But being joyful has become taboo during the war, they tell the BBC, because a lot of Ukrainians think they should suffer in solidarity with others. 
""I ended all of my relationships with any Russians because I'm angry and I'm not ready to continue them,"" says Larysa, a psychology student in her 20s whose name we have changed.
Deep anti-Russian feeling has spread since the invasion began and destroyed many relationships. It is known as ""splitting"" or ""black-and-white thinking"" in psychology, and the therapists admit it has affected them too. 
""It's as if I see a middle split between two chairs. And I have to choose one side in order not to get split apart,"" says Svetlana. ""There were Russian colleagues I had to say goodbye to - I can't work with them because I see fault in their behaviour in not being able to separate good from evil."" 
The feeling is widely shared. ""How can you work with victims if you justify violence?"" asks another group member. 
Some of the therapists gently suggest this anger would be better directed at President Vladimir Putin and his invading army, not Russian colleagues.  
But others point out that black-and-white thinking evolved to help people survive times of acute danger. 
""The amygdala part of the brain is like a fire alarm - it's linked to anxiety and controls 'freeze', 'run', 'fight' reactions, and it signals about life and death situations,"" explains Larysa. 
There is a paradox at the heart of being a therapist when your country is at war, it seems.  
If the goal of therapy is to dismantle defences so that people can feel things and deal with them, how do you reconcile that with a terrifying and traumatic environment where those same defences can actually keep you alive? 
Shelling, explosions and blackouts sometimes disrupt online sessions with vulnerable clients, the therapists tell the BBC. But they are determined to keep offering a safe space for clients to sit with difficult feelings and work through them. 
""We will win. We just need time, and I'm not sure how long,"" says Svetlana, adding: ""I've got no weapon but knowledge"". 
One day the war will be over. But the psychological toll may last for generations. 
The therapists tell the BBC they suffer some of the same traumas as their clients, although they try not to project their own feelings onto their patients.  
One member of the group says she has lost her son. Her bereavement is still raw and very difficult to talk about but through it all she has learnt that, as a therapist, ""you can't take somebody further than you've been yourself"". Empathy comes of suffering. 
Money is another worry for these therapists, all of whom helped patients for free when the war robbed them of their livelihoods. 
Inna is happy to have found paid, full-time therapy work. In fact, her new schedule of crisis services and youth support is so full-on that she says she will no longer attend these fortnightly therapists' meetings. 
""I love my work and it doesn't exhaust me, it actually energises me. Yesterday I led a group and I was getting text messages until 11pm from people saying how grateful they were."" 
Larysa makes a living as a photo editor for international magazines and brands, and has recently set up a private psychotherapy practice that is mostly free of charge to help the most needy. 
""My husband jokes that it cost us a pretty penny to run my therapy business and pay for all the supervision whilst I was getting nothing in return,"" she says, ""but thankfully we had some savings from before the war, and my husband's solidly employed."" 
The therapists know that their work is vital and want to secure more paid work so they can reach more civilians and soldiers in need, while also sustaining themselves financially and avoiding emotional burnout. 
""This is what sets us apart from the people attacking us. Giving refuge to people is a form of humanity,"" says Larysa.
""And when I do that, I feel human.""

Five key moments in the crushing of Afghan women's rights,"""We are going to allow women to study and work within our framework. Women are going to be very active in our society,"" the Taliban announced in their first press conference shortly after seizing power on 15 August 2021. 
Two years on, these assurances have been firmly demolished by the Taliban government's actions. The suppression of women's rights under their rule is the harshest in the world, brought in through a relentless series of religious decrees from the Taliban leadership, and regional rulings that have been steadily imposed across Afghanistan.
During each of these moments, the BBC has been on the ground speaking to Afghan girls and women - documenting grief, fear, hope and resolve as their lives and world have shrunk. 
The first indication of the Taliban's attitude to women came a month after the takeover. Secondary schools opened for boys following a ministry of education statement which made no mention of girls. 
""Locally, we were told not to attend classes,"" a 17-year-old female student told us in Kabul at the time. ""For 11 years, despite the risk of violence, I worked hard so I could become a doctor. I'm devastated,"" she wept, as she waved goodbye to her brothers heading off to school.
In the same week, female employees of the Kabul city administration were told by the mayor to stay at home, with only those who performed jobs which couldn't be done by men, allowed to continue.
But still, some women felt hope. ""They've kept universities open, so I think they will change their policy soon,"" one university student told us. 
At the time, we visited the headquarters of the Taliban's moral police, the Ministry of the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. It had been set up in the same compound where the Ministry of Women's Affairs of the former regime once was - a government department scrapped by the Taliban weeks after taking power.
We were told women were allowed into the ministry, but we didn't see any. 
""Why have you closed schools for girls?"" I asked a Taliban spokesman sitting in the compound, surrounded by Taliban fighters. 
""Girls themselves aren't going to school,"" he replied.
When challenged, he said: ""We will open schools for girls across the country. We are working to improve the security situation."" 
Women responded to the restrictions by marching on the streets of Afghan cities, demanding the right to work and study. They were violently stopped by the Taliban government on multiple occasions. 
""I was lashed with electric cables,"" one protester told us in a discreet meeting in one of her friend's homes. She'd been moving from place to place, fearing she'd be caught.
In January 2022, at least four female activists were detained - they were held for weeks and beaten in custody. 
Restrictions were being brought in incrementally. In December 2021, the government's virtue and vice ministry ordered that women travelling distances longer than 72km (45 miles) must be accompanied by a close male relative.
Then suddenly, there was a glimmer of hope. 
On 21 March 2023, the Taliban education department announced ""all students"" would be able to return to school at the start of the new academic term. 
Multiple Taliban officials told us that girls' schools would reopen.
Two days later, a BBC team watched female students filter into the Sayed ul Shuhada school, wiping dust off their desks, chattering excitedly as they returned to their classrooms. But within minutes, the mood had turned. 
A local Taliban education official had forwarded the headteacher a WhatsApp message, saying girls' secondary schools would remain closed until further notice. 
Many students burst into tears. ""What kind of country is this? What is our sin?"" one called Fatima said.
The Taliban government itself has been guarded when explaining its actions - calling them a return to traditional Islamic and Afghan values. Meanwhile, many ultra conservative clerics, tribal elders and their followers are part of the government's support base which helped them seize power in Afghanistan, and we've been told there are fears within the government that it could lose that support if it makes any move that goes against the elders' beliefs
Less than two months later, on 7 May 2022, the government announced a decree endorsed by its supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, mandating head-to-toe clothing for women.
""Those women who are not too old or young must cover their faces, except the eyes,"" it read.
It also ordered that male family members should ensure that women and girls comply, or they would face action.
On the ground we could see a change in how many women were visible on the streets, and how they were dressed.
Women who had worn long colourful tunics, a hijab, jeans and high heels told us they had begun to wear loose black abayas (gowns), a hijab, a surgical mask to cover their faces and trainers or boots. 
More women also began to wear black burkas. 
""We don't care what we have to wear if that means they allow us to study and work,"" one explained.
While women began to disappear from public life, the number of destitute women, who had been denied the right to work and the ability to feed their families, were increasingly visible on the streets begging for help.
We began to hear of more and more girls being forced into early marriages by their families, because they were not able to get an education or a job. 
By October 2022, a few months had passed without any major new restrictions. When they allowed girls, including those who had not completed their last year of school, to sit for university entrance exams, hopes began to be rekindled. 
During our conversations with Taliban leaders, it had become clear that there were divisions within the Taliban on the issue of women's education.
""Some religious scholars have problems with girls going to schools. The government is trying to build a consensus and resolve the matter,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told us during an interview.
But the Kandahar-based top leadership continued to harden its stance, significantly shrinking women's freedoms by the end of the year.
In November, a vice and virtue ministry spokesman told us that women had been banned from Kabul parks because they were not following Sharia [Islamic law]. 
We have often seen that such rulings announced for one city are invariably implemented across Afghanistan - as was the case with the parks ban. 
This time when we visited the ministry, we were told women were no longer allowed inside -  we were only exempted as foreigners.
Nearby, from the roof of a restaurant overlooking an amusement park in Kabul, we saw fathers with their children, Taliban fighters, and groups of boys enjoying an evening out, with no women in sight.
Women were also barred from gyms, swimming pools and public baths. 
""Every day, as girls in Afghanistan, we wake up to new restrictions,"" one female student told us. ""I was lucky I finished secondary school before the Taliban came. But I'm scared now that universities might also be closed for women."" 
And she was right. On 20 December 2022, the Taliban higher education minister ordered that all public and private universities immediately suspend all female education until further notice. 
Four days later, came another harsh blow. The Taliban's Ministry of Economy told all local and international NGOs operating in Afghanistan to ask their female employees to stop coming to work or have their permits revoked.  
The last few spaces where women could gather away from Taliban scrutiny were hair and beauty salons. 
But the Taliban government's announcement on 4 July to shut these down didn't come as a surprise to most people. 
Some 60,000 women were estimated to have been employed in salons.
""It was the only source of income for my family. My husband has health issues and cannot work. How will I feed my children?"" one salon owner told us.
Despite the risks, she's decided to run a salon from home because she says there is no other option.
Pushed indoors, we have seen some women finding ways to live their lives amid restrictions. Underground secret schools are running in parts of the country. Some NGOs still employ women who try to slip under the radar. 
Women are allowed to work in security, public health, arts and craft and a few other areas.
And every once in a while, despite the very grave risk of detention and violence, groups of Afghan women continue to march on the streets, raising their voices.
One of them told us: ""We are not the same women the Taliban suppressed 20 years ago. We have changed and they will have to accept it, even if we have to give up our lives for it.""

Judge sides with 16 activists in Montana climate case,"A Montana judge has sided with 16 young activists finding that the state violated their right to a ""clean and healthful environment"", which the state constitution guarantees. 
The plaintiffs, between ages five and 22, alleged the state's pro-fossil fuel policies contributed to climate change.
Similar cases have been brought forward by other youths, but this was the first case to go to trial. 
The state attorney general plans to appeal the ruling. 
Montana has piercing blue skies that appear bigger and brighter than just about anywhere else in the country. With its tall mountain ranges that open onto vast green fields, it gives 360 degrees of picture-perfect views. 
""It's wonderful being able to grow up here. And it's such a beautiful place,"" Rikki Held, the 22-year-old lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, told the BBC earlier this summer.
She grew up on a sprawling 7,000-acre ranch in Broadus, Montana. Learning about climate change in school, Miss Held thought it was something that impacted polar bears and ice caps far away from her home. But over the last several years, she says she's seen worsening flash flooding, droughts, and wildfires that have negatively impacted crops and livestock on her family's ranch. 
Miss Held felt she had no choice but to get involved with climate advocacy groups, like ""Our Children's Trust"" an Oregon based non-profit, which has sued state governments on behalf of youth in all 50 states. 
""[The state is] permitting and promoting a fossil-fuel based energy system, and that's contributing to climate change emissions,"" Miss Held said. ""It goes against some of our basic rights that are written in our constitution.""
Citing a 50-year-old clause in the constitution that guaranteed the ""state and each person shall maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment in Montana for present and future generations"", the lawsuit targeted a 2011 state law that made it illegal for environmental reviews to consider climate impacts when deciding on new projects, like building new power plants. 
On Monday, District Court Judge Kathy Seeley found the state's approval process for fossil fuel permits is unconstitutional, as it does not evaluate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.
""Montana's emissions and climate change have been proven to be a substantial factor in causing climate impacts to Montana's environment,"" wrote Judge Seeley. ""Plaintiffs have proven that as children and youth, they are disproportionately harmed by fossil fuel pollution and climate impacts.""
Julia Olson, the lead attorney for Our Children's Trust, called it a ""huge win for Montana, for youth, for democracy, and for our climate"".   
""More rulings like this will certainly come.""
Similar cases will soon be heard in several other states, including Hawaii, Utah and Alaska, as well as in countries like Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Colombia and Uganda. 
Kian, another young plaintiff, said in a statement: ""We are heard! Frankly the elation and joy in my heart is overwhelming in the best way.""
The lawsuit has divided Montanans between the treasures below ground and the environment above. 
Montana holds 30% of the country's recoverable coal reserves and produces the fourth-most coal among the US states. 
It brings in millions and millions of dollars of revenue every year for the state and jobs in the coal industry pay 30% more than the median income in the state. The lawsuit has proved especially contentious with the many Montanans who work in the coal industry.
About 112km [70 miles] northwest of Miss Held's family farm is the small mining town of Colstrip, which sits in the shadows of the tall smokestacks of one of the state's biggest power plants. In Colstrip, everyone knows everyone, and everyone lives and breathes coal. 
Joe Navasio worked as a miner for 40 years in the town. He moved to Colstrip before the coal boom in the 1970s and helped build it into the community that it is today. Take away coal, according to Joe, and there will be nothing left. 
""This whole town was designed for one thing,"" he exclaimed. ""To provide the northwest with electricity. If you want to turn your lights on, you need us."" 
Mr Novasio sees climate change as a global issue that can't be solved in Montana.
""We are a pittance of the problem,"" he said. ""You can't measure us against the rest of the world.""
Mr Novasio sees the climate case as an example of environmental groups using children to push forward their agenda
""I haven't seen one solution,"" he said, speaking about the court case. ""What about those poor kids in Colstrip? What about them? What about their parent's jobs? I don't see anybody running to our rescue."" 
The state is currently appealing the ruling. If the judge's decision is upheld, the state legislature will have to redraft its environmental review policies to take climate change into consideration for future power projects. 
Emily Flower, spokesperson for Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, called the ruling ""absurd"". 
""Montanans can't be blamed for changing the climate - even the plaintiffs' expert witnesses agreed that our state has no impact on the global climate,"" Ms Flower said. 
During the trial in June, the 16 plaintiffs presented evidence that carbon dioxide emissions contribute to hotter temperatures and more wildfires, which in turn is harming their physical and mental health. 
The state argued that even if Montana stopped producing carbon dioxide, it would not stop the acceleration of climate change since other states and countries still contribute to fossil fuel emissions.

Afghanistan: The Taliban's broken promises,"Two years ago, the Taliban swept into the Afghan capital, Kabul, as foreign forces hastily completed their withdrawal.
On taking power, the new administration made a series of pledges on women's rights to education, the economy and on tackling drug production.
How far have they lived up to these promises?
This was Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, in August 2021. 
Since then a wide range of strict measures have been re-imposed on women in Afghanistan. 
In December last year, women were banned from attending university. This followed an existing ban on education for girls beyond the sixth grade (11 to 12-year-olds) imposed soon after the Taliban came to power.
According to the UN, around 80% of girls and young women of school age are not in education.
The Taliban have also banned women from working in all non-governmental organisations, as well as for the UN, and ordered the closure of beauty salons across the country. 
Women's participation in the labour force has dropped by 25% between August 2021 and March 2023, according to the International Labour Organization. 
Amnesty International and the International Commission for Jurists have said that the restrictions on women imposed in Afghanistan could constitute gender persecution under the International Criminal Court. 
This was another pledge made by spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, soon after the Taliban took control two years ago.
Opium is used to make heroin - and Afghanistan has been, by far, the world's largest source of opium for many years.
In April 2022, the Taliban announced a ban on the growing of opium poppies - but without setting a deadline.
A BBC investigation in June this year found there had been a significant drop in cultivation in Helmand, Nangarhar and Kandahar provinces.
In Helmand province, which previously accounted for as much as half of all poppy production, there has been a reduction in the cultivated area from 129,000 hectares in 2022 to 740 hectares in April 2023, according to satellite imagery from UK-based analysts, Alcis.
Cultivation has also been significantly cut in Nangarhar - from 7,000 hectares in 2022 to just 865 hectares in 2023. 
However, in more remote parts of the country, satellite imagery has revealed continued production.
Taliban plans for economic growth - expressed here in 2021 by Zabihullah Mujahid - have not been borne out in practice.
The suspension of most international aid and the freezing of access to Afghanistan's foreign exchange reserves have had serious economic consequences. 
In June last year, the UN Security Council estimated that the Afghan economy had contracted by 30%-40% since the Taliban takeover.
Despite some limited improvement in economic indicators since then, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) says ""overall, Afghanistan's economic outlook remains very difficult"". 
""This will be particularly so,"" it adds, ""if the recent restrictions on women's employment in NGOs lead to a significant drop in international aid, exacerbating pressures on the exchange rate and inflation."" 
The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has recorded a significant fall in violence against civilians since the peak of the conflict in 2016.
However, attacks on former Afghan government and security officials, prisoners, women and journalists have continued.
According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled), civilians have been targeted by both the Taliban and rebel groups which oppose them such as the National Resistance Front (NRF), the largest armed anti-Taliban group. 
""Attacks on civilians have often taken place in the context of Taliban raids on villages in search of NRF fighters. Civilians accused of supporting the NRF are frequently detained, tortured or killed,"" Acled notes in its latest report. 
Women have also been the targets of assaults as more restrictions are placed their ability to work, acquire education and move freely in public spaces. 
A UN survey conducted earlier this year said that 68% women felt their safety was ""very bad"" or ""bad"".

We are now bringing our live coverage to a close.
If you'd like to read more about the criminal charges Donald Trump faces, here's a simple guide to his four big legal cases.
And for more on the 13 new charges brought against Trump in Georgia, click here.
Our coverage today was edited by Brandon Livesay, Marianna Brady, Alexandra Fouché and Tiffany Wertheimer. It was written by Thomas Mackintosh, Adam Durbin, Ali Abbas Ahmadi, Barbara Tasch, Ece Goksedef, Jamie Whitehead and Emily Atkinson. Kayla Epstein, Madeline Halpert and Sarah Smith brought you the latest from Georgia.
If you're just joining us, here's a rundown of what's been happening:
Kayla Epstein
Reporting from Georgia
At first glance, the federal charges against Trump for 2020 election interference and the Georgia state charges seem to have a lot of overlap. 
Both deal heavily with the actions of Trump and his associates in Georgia, and even zero in on the same actions.
But the prosecutors in each case have taken a very different strategic approach.
Jack Smith, the Justice Department special counsel overseeing the case in Washington DC, indicted only Donald Trump - though the indictment mentions unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly helped carry out election interference. 
Prosecuting only Trump allows Smith to move much faster, as the government has indicated it would like a speedy trial ahead of the 2024 election.
Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney in Georgia, did the opposite: she charged Trump along with 18 other co-defendants in a racketeering case. 
It's a sprawling legal strategy that allows her to try multiple figures at once. Willis is trying to hold several people responsible for a wide range of activity in Georgia, all while pointing the finger at Trump.
In fact, several of the named defendants in the Georgia case - Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Cheseboro - are also unnamed co-conspirtators in the federal indictment. 
Willis's case is the first time they are actually being charged for their alleged attemps to help the former president interfere in the 2020 election.
Before Rudy Giuliani was Trump's personal lawyer, and prior to serving as mayor of New York City, has was a federal prosecutor.
In the 1980s, Giuliani made headlines around the world for aggressively going after New York's Italian-American mafia, the infamous ""Five Families"".
The investigation - which involved hundreds of FBI agents and New York police officers - saw extensive use of listening devices, discreetly placed in locations including an East Harlem social club and a mob driver's Jaguar used to ferry gangsters across the city.
Anyone who can be connected to a criminal enterprise can be convicted under Rico, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
But now, decades after using Rico to tackle organisational crime, Giuliani is on the other side of the law.
He faces 13 charges, more than any of the co-accused except for Trump himself. 
Giuliani has dismissed the investigation against him as politically motivated.
You can read more about Giuliani and his prosecutions against NYC crime families here.
Among the list of lawyers and political movers and shakers listed on the indictment is a name you might not be familiar with, Trevian C. Kutti.
Kutti is the ex-publicist of Kanye West - the rapper now known as Ye. Kutti was also previously a spokesperson for R. Kelly.
According to the charges filed against Kutti, she went to a Georgia election worker's home in January 2021, when Trump's team were trying to find ways to challenge the state's election results. 
Kutti allegedly pressured the worker to make a false statement.
The Chicago-based publicist has been charged with violating Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, conspiracy to commit solicitation of false statements and writings, and influencing a witness.
A spokesperson for Ye told Reuters that Kutti was not associated with the rapper ""at the time of the facts"". 
You might remember Ye himself ran for president in 2020, and has spoken about running again in 2024.

Reporting from Georgia
While Trump's legal team has not laid out their strategy in public, there are a few moves they could make to defend him against the charges.
The first is requesting that the case be ""removed"" from state court to federal court.
Trump's lawyers could argue that as president, he was acting as an officer of the federal government in order to ensure the legitimacy of the 2020 election, Anthony Michael Kreis of Georgia State University College of Law explained.
Moving the case to federal court would widen the jury pool beyond Democratic-leaning Fulton County, though plenty of people here have mixed opinions of Trump.
Another obvious defence for Trump to attempt is a First Amendment argument - that his false claims of election fraud in Georgia was protected political speech.
Kayla Epstein
Reporting from Georgia
A total of 19 defendants are named in this indictment, with
Donald Trump at the top of the list. But not all of them could wind up standing
trial.
It's not unusual in a racketeering case for some of the
defendants to take plea deals or flip and work with prosecutors in exchange for
a lighter punishment, Anthony Michael Kreis of Georgia State University College
of Law explains.
""Prosecutors often start big and winnow people out through
plea deals and other means,"" Kreis told me.
""There will be deals that will be struck, there will be
offers made, some people might turn into states' evidence in order to save
themselves the lengthy and stressful process of a trial.""
By the time this case goes before a jury, those 19 defendants
could whittle down to a smaller number.
""For those who don't reach deals, Willis says she plans to
try all of the defendants together"" Kreis says.
Madeline Halpert
Reporting from Georgia
Yesterday, Donald Trump and 18 others were charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act. 
Presenting that type of case allows Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to broaden the evidence and witnesses that she can present at trial, according to former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani. 
Those charges also carry a potential 20-year prison sentence, which is more severe than all the other charges Trump and his co-defendants are facing, Rahmani told the BBC.
But Rico cases are also highly complex, and this is Trump's fourth indictment, meaning Willis is likely fourth in line for a trial, the timing of which could be complicated by Trump's run for president in 2024, he said. 
That ""raises the question of whether Willis waited too long"" to bring charges, Rahmani added.

Committed
Republicans in Cobb County, Georgia, have been expecting these charges.
They’ve
watched Donald Trump’s support increase each time he gets arrested and are
clearly not worried about his legal problems.
I attended
a breakfast hosted by the local Republican party in Marietta, Georgia. There
they held a straw poll asking attendees to write on slips of paper who they
want as their party’s presidential candidate - Trump won easily.
I asked
Salleigh Grubbs, the Republican Party chairperson in Cobb County, if Trump can
successfully run for president if he's fighting four court cases at the same
time. 
She says their straw poll here speaks for itself. “He's a fighter, he's used
to fighting, he's been fighting for years. So I think he'll have no problem,”
Grubbs told me.
Wearing a
bright red cap with ""USA"" and ""Trump 45"" on it, Jerry Ramsey, 79, shoots down
any suggestions the former president is only running for office again to try
and stay out of prison.
He tells me: “That makes
no sense whatsoever. He started running for president. You know, the day after
he lost or after they say he lost.”
Like all judges in the state of Georgia, Inspector General Scott McAfee was randomly selected to oversee Donald Trump's case.
He only became a Fulton County Superior Court judge in February, having worked as an investigator and prosecutor with cases involving ""major drug trafficking organizations, fraud, and illegal firearms possession"", according to his biography.
When McAfee was appointed to the Office of Inspector General in 2021, Governor Brian Kemp said: ""His experience as a tough prosecutor equips him to search out fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption, and bring those to justice who break the law.""
In June, he fined pro-Trump attorney and conspiracy theorist, Lin Wood, $5,000 (£3,924) for violating an order forbidding him from insulting his former law partners.

Reporting from Georgia
Yesterday marked a long, whirlwind day here in Atlanta, where Trump and 18 other defendants were charged for their alleged involvement in a wide-ranging scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. 
Reporters waited for hours all day long as several witnesses testified before the grand jury, which did not end up returning an indictment against the former president until after 10:00PM local time. 
The day capped off just before midnight, as Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis appeared before reporters to break down the felony charges Trump and his alleged co-conspirators are facing. 
And the saga could drag on for yet another week, as the defendants in the case don't have to turn themselves in until next Friday. 
In the leaked phone call where Donald Trump can be heard telling Georgia's top election official to ""find 11,780 votes"", it is Brad Raffensperger that you can hear on the other end, refusing to yield to pressure and telling Trump: ""The data that you have is wrong.""
The Secretary of State for Georgia - who is a Republican - has just released a statement, following last night's indictment of the former president.
“The most basic principles of a strong democracy are accountability and respect for the Constitution and rule of law. You either have it, or you don’t,” he wrote, with no direct mention of the charges.
The phone call between Trump and Raffensperger, which was recorded and released by the Washington Post in January 2021, helped spark the opening of the investigation by Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis.
A picture of Hillary Clinton smiling on MSNBC as news broke of the charges against Trump has been widely shared on social media.
She
was being interviewed live by host Rachel Maddow when the indictment was unsealed.
“This is not the
circumstances in which I expected to be talking to you,"" Maddow said.
“I can’t
believe this,” Clinton laughed.
Despite
appearing happy in this moment, Clinton said she felt “great, profound sadness that we have a
former president who has been indicted [on] so many charges that went right to
the heart of whether or not our democracy would survive”.
Clinton
lost the 2016 presidential election to Trump in what was a crushing defeat for the former first lady and secretary of state.

As Donald Trump faces another criminal indictment, here’s a
reminder of some of the things the former president claimed after the 2020
presidential election in that phone call to Georgia's top election official, Republican
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. 
Trump made claims about
thousands of “dead people” voting, the alleged shredding of ballot papers, and the actions of electronic voting machines -  all of which we fact-checked at the time and found
no evidence for.

For those of you not steeped in the jargon of the US justice system, being indicted is the equivalent of being formally accused or charged with a crime. 
The process often begins with what is known as a grand jury, typically made up of 16 to 23 people who assess evidence put to them by prosecutors and decide whether there is enough to charge someone with a criminal offence.
The term indictment itself is the formal name for a list of charges, which contains basic information to inform the person in question about the crimes they have been accused of by prosecutors.
A few moments ago, Donald Trump posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, saying he would hold a news conference in New Jersey on Monday.
He wrote: ""A Large, Complex, Detailed but Irrefutable REPORT on the Presidential Election Fraud which took place in Georgia is almost complete & will be presented by me at a major News Conference at 11:00 A.M. on Monday of next week in Bedminster, New Jersey. 
""Based on the results of this CONCLUSIVE Report, all charges should be dropped against me & others - There will be a complete EXONERATION! 
""They never went after those that Rigged the Election. They only went after those that fought to find the RIGGERS!""
He then posted again one minute later writing ""witch hunt"" in capital letters.

Donald Trump has been called “Teflon Don” for his seeming ability to shake off political scandals that would have stuck to - and taken down - normal politicians.
It’s a nickname that was originally coined for a different kind of “don” - New York City mafia boss John Gotti, who had the uncanny knack of avoiding criminal prosecution.
Now, however, Trump is facing the kind of racketeering charges - allegations of running a “criminal enterprise” - that ultimately landed the New York mobster in prison.
Juries will determine whether Trump’s latest indictment ends with a similar legal fate. The former president’s political fortunes however - at least when it comes to winning the Republican presidential nomination - seem destined not to be adversely affected.
Trump has framed the legal charges against him as an attempt by his political enemies - the Washington ruling class, the elites, the vested powerful interests - to thwart his return to the White House. It’s an argument that his supporters, alienated from and angry at the established order and suspicious of government, have taken to heart.
While there are some conservatives who have their doubts about Trump - his ability to win elections and effectively govern - they are disorganised and divided.
As long as they remain so,  Trump will have the upper hand.
The 19 defendants - including Donald Trump - have until noon on 25 August to surrender to authorities in Fulton County, Georgia.
When he arrives, according to procedure, Trump is expected to have his mugshot photo taken, unlike in his other arraignments.
The local sheriff has vowed that the court would follow ""our normal practices"" - so the former president will be treated no differently to any other person.
Earlier this month, Fulton County Sheriff Pat Labat told local media: “Unless somebody tells me differently, we are following our normal practices, and so it doesn’t matter your status, we’ll have a mugshot ready for you.""
At previous arraignments, although his fingerprints were recorded, Trump did not have a mugshot taken because he was thought to be too well known to need it.
If he does have his picture taken, it is thought he will be the first US president to have a mugshot - although there are no guarantees the image will be made public.

A person close with the former president tells me that last night Donald Trump had been “angry but prepared” for these latest indictments in Georgia (which his team had long been expecting). 
The Trump Team’s strategy, according to people close to him, will be to push for a delay in this case, then win the election in 2024 and hope that the Republican Governor of Georgia will pardon him.
Drew Findling, 64, has represented Cardi B, Migos and Gucci Mane in
court, and now he is adding Donald Trump to his list of clients.
His politics don’t align with Trump's - Findling once called the former president ""racist"" and ""pathetic"" on social media. But Findling says his professional life is separate
from his personal tweets.
“We do not choose or exclude our clients based on their
political beliefs,” he told VICE News.
Findling's teammate is Jennifer Little, who according to her
website has nearly two decades of experience prosecuting and defending criminal
and civil cases.
His courtroom problems are mounting as he campaigns to become president again in the 2024 election.
Three indictments, 78 charges, three trials. We assess his expected defence and which case should worry him most.
Mr Trump and others face charges under the Rico Act for alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Fulton County’s first female district attorney is known for her ability to handle complex cases.
What are the charges, how serious are they and could Donald Trump still run for president from jail?
They tell the BBC how these charges compare to previous cases and how this sets up the 2024 election.

Burning mangrove trees for a living: 'I'd quit tomorrow if I could',"Indonesia has more mangrove trees than any other country but there's growing concern about the ""dangerous"" rate they are being cut down, turned into charcoal and exported to places such as Europe, China and Japan. People involved in the work know the trees are important for the environment and would like to quit but they see no other way to survive. 
Inside a wooden hut, near his house on the island of Borneo, Nurhadi keeps two furnaces burning all year round. The 68-year-old employs at least a dozen people. 
Four men cut up wood collected from mangrove trees, while another throws it into a furnace made from earth and stones. Once burned, the wood is cooled and packaged, ready to be sold. 
Mangrove wood is very hard and dense but not very durable, which makes it ideal for charcoal production and particularly good for barbeques. But it is a resource-intensive process with little return.
Sixteen tonnes of raw material only produces three tonnes of charcoal. ""If I produce less than three tonnes, it's a loss,"" Nurhadi says. Once costs are taken into account, he estimates he only makes a profit of about $1,250 (£1,000) per year. 
""There's no money in cutting down mangroves. Nobody gets rich from charcoal furnaces. We do this to have food on our plate,"" he explains. 
A conversation he once had with a government official sums up his predicament: ""He asked me: 'Are you ready to leave the charcoal business?' I answered: 'If you can provide farming land or other opportunities, I'd quit tomorrow.'""
Almost half of the 9,000 people in Nurhadi's village, Batu Ampar, rely on mangrove charcoal for a living, a tradition dating back to the 1940s. Some families like Nurhadi's have been doing this for generations - his father and grandfather owned the same furnaces, so he says this is the only work he knows.
Indonesia is home to 20% of the world's mangroves, and Nurhadi's area, the Kuba Raya Regency has the biggest mangrove forest in the western part of Indonesian Borneo.
But the number of furnaces is increasing - in 2000 there were 90 but today there are at least 490 - and that is speeding up deforestation. 
Arsyad Al Amin, who is involved in a local research project, predicts that the Batu Ampar mangrove forest will only last for another 74 years if things carry on as they are. ""It will all be gone in 2096,"" the researcher from the Bogor Agricultural Institute says. 
Thick, dense forest areas of mangrove canopy have decreased so much that bare patches can now be seen from planes overhead.
""If there is no effort to accelerate rehabilitation, this is dangerous. We desperately need intervention,"" he warns. 
Source: The Ocean Agency
Deep in the forest, an hour north of Batu Ampar village by boat, dozens of mangrove trees have been cut down. The people living along the river breathe in air mingled with the smoke coming from rows of furnaces. 
There are areas in this forest where it is legal to take wood, but as the number of furnaces grows, it gets harder to source raw materials and loggers venture further into the protected areas. 
Among the sound of monkey chatter and birdsong is the unmistakable sound of a chainsaw revving up.
We speak to some men who are cutting down an average-sized mangrove tree. ""We would not cut down the big trees,"" says one lumberjack who refuses to reveal his name because he is operating in a protected forest. He's wearing minimal safety gear. ""A logger died from being crushed by wood when cutting,"" he says. ""This is a high risk job, but my children need to eat.""
The local environment and forestry agency claims it's been hard to enforce the regulations on illegal logging.
""There are too many home furnaces and a large number of locals involved in this activity,"" spokesman Adi Yani says. 
He also thinks that if they impose the rules strictly ""it has the potential to cause social unrest"".
""Repressive law enforcement"" was carried out a few years ago against loggers and furnace owners in Batu Ampar village, says an official with the local government, Herbimo Utoyo.  But, he adds, ""it never reached court because it is viewed as a tradition, a culture"".
He also says the government has offered to train people how to farm honey from the forest and produce palm sugar to try to move them away from the charcoal industry, but he admits: ""It hasn't been successful yet. It's hard to break something that has been done from generation to generation.""
But one man who quit the charcoal business says the government needs to do more. ""We feel like we were left alone without the government's support. If they do have programmes, maybe they only came to the head of the village. No-one came to us,"" 39-year-old Suheri says. 
Ten years ago, he used to run two furnaces but decided to stop after a peatland fire smothered his village in smoke. ""I thought that if the fire happened in our mangrove forest, we'd be devastated,"" he explains. 
Before the pandemic, he tried farming mud crab in mangrove aquaculture, but the venture failed. ""I suffered a huge loss, and I am in debt because of it,"" he says. Now he collects honey from the forest's bees instead.
Suheri uses his boat to navigate the waterways and can spend hours looking for beehives that are ready to be harvested.
When he spots one, he puts on a homemade hat with a veil, climbs up the tree and uses smoke from burned nipah leaves to distract the bees. ""There are many risks with collecting honey - mud, wild animals, snakes and crocodiles. The least of the risks is getting stung by the bees,"" he says with a little laugh.
If he is lucky, Suheri can collect up to five bottles of honey in a day, with one bottle of raw, wild forest honey selling for $10 (£8). It's a very good price but he says he can't count on just honey for a living because ""the harvesting season is uncertain"".
When he's not in the forest looking for honey, Suheri breeds croaker fish but the eggs are expensive and there is a high chance they will die. 
Even thought it's not easy, he says he is determined to find something other than the furnaces to make money, in the hope it inspires others in his village to stop cutting down mangrove trees to make charcoal.
""I have to do better... If I want people to change, I have to succeed!"" he exclaims.

Back to the future for India's rice farmers,"Varsha Sharma has been through some turbulent years on her small farm in the mountainous state of Himachal Pradesh, in northern India.
For more than a century her family have been rice farmers, but erratic rainfall and water being diverted for industry have made cultivating rice more difficult.
Seven years ago she switched to a hybrid rice variety and to growing apples, but that just caused fresh problems.
The hybrid rice variety promised increased production, but needed a lot of additives, which she says damaged the soil.
""We destroyed our soils by adding chemicals and fertilizers,"" she says.
So in 2018 she switched again, this time experimenting with red rice, a variety which has a long history in Himachal Pradesh, but has dwindled as farmers have switched to modern varieties.
Red rice has attractive qualities. It is hardy and grows well without fertiliser and other chemicals. Research also shows it has nutritional benefits over white rice. 
But perhaps for farmers the biggest attraction is that it sells well.
""Red rice fetches a good price, ranging between $3 and $4 per kilo in the retail market, as it completely organic. This has helped many farmers like me,"" says Ms Sharma.
The government of Himachal Pradesh wants to expand the production of red rice, increasing its area under cultivation to 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres).
Red rice is not the only traditional variety being promoted.
In West Bengal, the largest rice producing state in India, almost half of its arable land is under rice cultivation.
It is home to more than 5,000 varieties of rice, but the majority are no longer grown.
""They [farmers] are only thinking about increased production, hence are switching to hybrid varieties,"" says Anjan Kumar Sinha, the founder of the Socio-Environmental Welfare Society (ARSWS), which promotes conservation and the restoration of biodiversity. 
He says that farming hybrid rice varieties can be expensive.
""When hybrid seeds are used, the demand for pesticide increases and the costs go up in an unsustainable way.
""Indigenous rice seed varieties have adapted to local ecologies and can resist drought and floods. We have varieties of rice seeds in India which can grow without water,"" says Mr Sinha.
Farmers who join his organisation get a kilo of seeds free, enough to produce up to 60kg of rice. In return the farmers have to return a kilo of seeds.
""These varieties may play a vital role in sustainable agriculture in drought prone regions,"" he adds.
Rice is widely consumed and grown in India and it is the world's biggest exporter of the grain.
But in July, to tame surging domestic prices after heavy rains hurt crops, the Indian government banned the export of non-basmati white rice.
This came after Russia withdrew from a deal guaranteeing the safe passage of Ukrainian grain, putting more pressure on global food supplies.
Shankar Patnaik, who is also a farmer and seed conservationist, says that farmers ""became greedy"" and started growing rice from hybrid seeds to boost production.
""We used lot of urea and fertilizers which destroyed our soil. Also now very few farmers are using traditional seeds to grow rice,"" he says.
Mr Patnaik has a collection of 500 rice varieties and is experimenting with many of them on his 14 acres of land.
""There are several indigenous rice varieties that can have higher yields but their potential is not fully explored. Even without application of chemical fertilizers one can get a good yield. But generally, people consider these as low yielding varieties and don't pay much attention,"" says Mr Patnaik.
As well as experimenting with varieties, Mr Patnaik is working on growing methods that need less water.
In particular he uses the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) method. In that technique famers flood fields, allow them to drain for a few days, and then flood them again.
This is one of the processes promoted by India's Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA), an organisation that works with farmers to make farming more sustainable.
""Rice is highly water-consuming crop. It's grown in stagnant water and consumes about 5,000 litres if water per kg of rice,"" says GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director of the CSA.
He says bacteria in rice ponds emit methane, and flooding damages the soil structure, and can make it more salty.
He says there are several ways of growing rice with less water, but at the moment they need more support.
""There are no proper campaigns or training on these methods and no incentive for farmers to make a shift,"" says Mr Ramanjaneyulu.
""Many of the current incentive systems like fertilizer subsidy, free power, canal irrigation, minimum support price and procurement, all work against the interest of farmers to shift towards more sustainable production,"" he adds. 
More technology of business:
One farmer who has embraced a new technique is Prema Devi from Farsali Malde, a village in the northern state of Uttarakhand.
""Most of the people from the village are farmers but with major climatic changes we started facing a lot of problems. Our crops got destroyed because of unseasonal rains or scarcity of water,"" she says.
So, in 2021 she started to reduce the number of rice seeds she planted.
Rice saplings are grown in nursery beds and are transferred to main field after 12 to 14 days, where they are planted six to eight inches apart. 
""The spacing between each plant gives them more oxygen, and minimises the competition between plants for nutrients and sunlight,"" says Ms Devi.
She says the system has doubled her rice production to 100kg a year.
""It was not easy for us to believe that a simple change in technique was all we needed,"" she says.

Right to Information: Will this hard-won Indian law get weaker?,"A crucial new law that aims to protect the personal data of Indians will dilute another landmark legislation that brought much-needed transparency into government functioning, experts say.
Until last week, India did not have a law to regulate how the personal information of individuals is collected, stored and processed. The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, which was passed in parliament, fulfils that long-standing demand. 
But privacy experts have raised serious concerns, pointing out that the law does not protect citizens from surveillance and that it gives excessive power to the federal government in terms of application.
One major criticism is the change the legislation makes to the landmark right to information (RTI) law, which allows people to access data from the government. Since it was passed in 2005 - after years of campaigning - millions of Indians have used the RTI law to ask questions and demand information from government departments and officials.
But the new legislation changes a provision of the RTI law to exempt ""personal information"" from being disclosed - this will affect a majority of the information currently sought under it.
""Everything that people have been using the RTI law for - to hold governments accountable, to fight corruption [etc.] - has somewhere an element of personal information,"" says Anjali Bhardwaj, co-convenor of the National Campaign for People's Right to Information, which was critical in getting the RTI law passed in 2005.
Madan Lokur, a former Supreme Court judge, says that the amendment ""will emasculate the RTI to a large extent"".
While the implementation of the RTI law was never perfect - information was often denied on flimsy grounds and successive governments have made several attempts to dilute it - activists fear the latest change will make answers almost impossible to access.
The RTI law covers a wide ambit of organisations, including all departments formed under the Constitution or any government law or notification. Even organisations that are substantially financed by any government, even indirectly, are covered.
The RTI Act's default position is that all information should be made available to citizens when requested, barring a few exceptions such as national security. 
One of the clauses, which is under contention, says that if the information is of a personal nature and does not relate to any ""public activity"" or would cause an ""unwarranted invasion"" of an individual's privacy, then the officer can deny the request - unless they find that it should be made available in ""larger public interest"".
A 2012 committee on privacy law headed by Justice AP Shah had recommended that disclosures under the RTI Act should not constitute an infringement of privacy. 
The new data protection law overrides this clause. It merely says that any information that ""relates to personal information"" can be denied - which could include any answer that identifies an individual.
""Earlier there was a filter that personal information should not have a relationship with any public activity or unwarranted invasion of privacy,"" says Shailesh Gandhi, a former Central Information Commissioner who was responsible for deciding on complaints under the RTI Act.
Mr Gandhi says that to ensure that the law was easily implemented, it also spelt out that if information cannot be denied to a legislature, it should not be denied to an individual as well. 
But now there is a blanket ban on personal information, which Mr Gandhi says is problematic, as ""you could relate any information to a person one way or the other"".
The data protection law also says that non-compliance with it could attract hefty monetary fines, going up to 2.5bn rupees ($30.1m; £23.7m). This can discourage officers from disclosing answers which could be related to personal information.
""Even if they impose a [lower fine], which officer would take the risk [of disclosing personal information in public interest]?"" Mr Gandhi asks.
Federal minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said in an interview that the change in the law takes into account a landmark 2017 Supreme Court ruling on privacy ""which said personal data can be processed if it passes the test of legality, legitimacy, and proportionality"" and that it won't affect the RTI.
Activists fear the change will affect their ability to seek information that has helped check corruption and ensure the delivery of basic rights.
""For instance, under the National Food Security Act, to check if there is corruption and someone does not get their rations, then people try to access information about fair-price shops and their sales registers to find out who was sold ration,"" Ms Bhardwaj says. This helps check for pilferages in the ration given by the government's public distribution system.
She also points out that Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) students have used the law to ask colleges to provide data about the admission process if they were not allotted a place even when they had the required marks.
Without this information, ""the RTI Act would not keep a check on corruption and [this would] reduce transparency"", Mr Gandhi says.
He points to an instance during his tenure where a person got a copy of the degrees of doctors appointed at a government hospital. ""After going through them, they found out that there were several people who held fake degrees,"" he says.
Such answers could become unavailable under the new law, he believes, since they would disclose the personal information of individuals.
Even now, officials deny many RTI requests by just saying that the information is personal, Mr Gandhi says. He now expects these denials to increase.
The change doesn't affect a section in the RTI law that says that says that even if the information falls under any of the exceptions (such as personal information), an officer could still allow access to it if the public interest ""outweighs the harms to the protected interests"".
But this flips the burden on people seeking the information. 
""A person seeking information under RTI does not have to justify why they are seeking the information,"" Ms Bhardwaj says. ""But now, I will have to prove that there is a public interest and that its non-disclosure has larger harms to the protected interest.""

Ethiopia Amhara: Air strike kills at least 26 in Finote Selam,"This video can not be played
Ethiopia Amhara violence: Why are militias and government forces fighting?
A suspected air strike in Ethiopia's Amhara region has killed at least 26 people, a hospital official said.
The strike in Finote Selam on Sunday was among the most deadly in the region, where the army has been fighting Fano, a paramilitary force.
Ethiopia's human rights commission has expressed ""grave concern"" over the ""deadly hostilities"". 
PM Abiy Ahmed's government imposed a six-month state of emergency across Amhara on 4 August. 
The fighting has been fuelled by Fano accusations that the federal government is trying to weaken Amhara's defences. 
It is Ethiopia's worst crisis since a civil war in the northern Tigray region ended in November. Fano backed federal forces during the Tigray war. 
Fano has refused to disarm, prompting the federal government to deploy the army.
The hospital official told the AFP news agency that all the victims who arrived on Sunday were ""wearing either casual civilian clothing or Sunday traditional clothes"".
""The casualties range from a 13-year-old child to the elderly,"" he said. ""I didn't get the chance to see what caused the explosion... but residents said it was a drone strike"".
A university teacher who was visiting a relative in the hospital told Reuters he had seen 14 bodies there and been told by a medical worker that another 12 had died.
Fifty-five more are being treated for injuries sustained in the explosion, a hospital official said.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called on ""conflicting parties to immediately end"" all alleged violations of human rights laws.
The violence has led to drastic action, such as the Israeli government evacuating its citizens and Jewish people from the area last week. Amhara is home to thousands of members of the Jewish community.
The EHRC said has documented the killing of protesters, the looting of weapons and ammunition from police stations and prisons, and the targeting of Amhara regional administration officials.

UBS to pay $1.4bn to settle fraud claims from 2008 crisis,"Swiss bank UBS has agreed to pay $1.4bn (£1.1bn) to resolve fraud claims in the US stemming from the 2008 financial crisis.
It brings to a close the last case brought by US prosecutors investigating banks' conduct in the run-up to the crash, which sparked a global downturn.
Prosecutors said the bank had lied about the quality of mortgages that were packaged and sold to investors in a series of deals in 2006-2007.
UBS did not admit or deny the claims.
In a statement, it said it had already set aside money for the ""legacy"" matter and the deal would resolve all civil claims in the US. 
The bank had previously sought to have the case dismissed, saying prosecutors had not presented evidence of any intentional fraud.
In the lawsuit, which was brought in 2018, US prosecutors alleged that the Swiss bank had misled investors in connection with the sale of mortgage-backed securities more than a decade ago. 
Ryan K Buchanan, United States attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, said UBS' conduct had ""played a significant role in causing a financial crisis that harmed millions of Americans"".
""The scope of this settlement should serve as a warning to other financial institutions - both large and small - of the significant penalties that can result when corporations misrepresent vital information to investors and undermine trust in our public markets,"" he added.
UBS, which is one of the world's top investment banks, is the eighteenth firm to reach a settlement in the US over its role in the 2008 crisis, prosecutors said.
The deals have led to more than $36bn in penalties altogether, involving the world's biggest banks, ratings firms and others. 
US banks including JP Morgan and Bank of America have agreed to pay far larger sums than UBS. 
Global banks' exposure to bad US mortgages in the early 2000s played a key role in sparking the financial crisis, which led to a sharp contraction in the global economy and the most severe downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s in America.
Unexpected losses stemming from the loans created strains in the financial system and led to the collapse of several major banks, including Lehman Brothers in the US in 2008.
Prosecutors have accused banks of fuelling the crisis with illegal mortgage lending, which spread to the wider financial system thanks to widespread trading of securities backed by mortgages.

"Niger coup: Ousted President Bazoum to be charged with high treason, junta says","Niger's military junta has announced plans to prosecute deposed President Mohamed Bazoum for high treason and undermining national security.
This is the latest sign that the junta intends to resist international pressure to return power to Mr Bazoum. 
The West African regional bloc Ecowas said it was shocked to learn that the junta wanted to prosecute him.
He has been held in the basement of his palace since the military staged a coup about three weeks ago.
Mr Bazoum was in ""good spirits"" despite being held in ""difficult"" conditions, his doctor said after a visit.
Saturday's visit was approved amid growing international demands for Mr Bazoum's release.
The US State Department expressed its dismay that the Niger leader had been charged, with spokesperson Vedant Patel describing the charges as ""completely unwarranted and unjustified"". 
Mr Patel said they would not ""contribute to a peaceful resolution of this crisis"", and said they were a ""further affront, in our opinion, to democracy and justice and to the respect of the rule of law.""
But in a sign that it is hardening its position, the junta said in a statement read out on state TV that it had gathered evidence to prosecute ""the deposed president and his local and foreign accomplices for high treason and undermining the internal and external security of Niger"".
It did not give further details. 
Mr Bazoum, 63, is being held captive with his wife and son and there were growing concerns about their health. 
Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, the head of the presidential guards unit, declared himself Niger's new ruler on 26 July after overthrowing him.
Ecowas has threatened military action to reverse the coup, but it has so far failed to follow through on its threat. 
The coup leaders have warned they will defend themselves against any intervention.
Ecowas has also imposed sanctions on the junta, including cutting electricity to Niger. This has caused blackouts in the capital Niamey, and other major cities. 
Ecowas said the move to prosecute Mr Bazoum was a new form of provocation which contradicted the military's reported willingness to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. 
On Saturday, a high-powered delegation of Muslim clerics from neighbouring Nigeria met junta leaders in Niamey in a bid to mediate an end to the crisis. 
Junta-appointed Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine said he was optimistic that talks with  Ecowas would take place in the coming days ""to discuss how the sanctions against us will be lifted"".  
The coup in Niger mirrored similar takeovers in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali, amid an Islamist insurgency and a growing Russian influence in the wider Sahel region through its mercenary group Wagner.
Despite his captivity, Mr Bazoum was able to publish an article in The Washington Post stating that he was a hostage and that the coup would have ""devastating consequences for our country, our region and the entire world"".
Mr Bazoum is reported to have lost a ""worrying"" amount of weight, while his 20-year-old son, who has a chronic medical condition, was also reportedly denied care.
UN human rights chief Volker Turk described the conditions of the detention as inhumane, degrading and in violation of international human rights law.
His daughter Zazia, 34, who was on holiday in France during the coup, told the UK-based Guardian newspaper last week that her father, mother and brother had no clean water or electricity and were living on rice and pasta.
Fresh food was rotting in the fridge because there was no power, she said. 
The deputy director at Human Rights Watch Africa, Carine Kaneza Nantulya, also told the BBC that they were concerned the charges may be politically motivated.
""In terms of the potential charge that has been talked about we're also concerned that this might be a politically motivated charge, given the length and the nature of President Bazoum's detention and the other co-detainees"", she added.
Mr Bazoum has been seen once since he was overthrown, in a photo released after he met Chad's leader Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno.
Mr Déby met both the junta and Mr Bazoum soon after the coup in a failed bid to resolve the crisis.

Canadian couple win damages from Italian ruling party,"Italy's far-right ruling party has been ordered to pay damages to a same-sex couple for using a photo of them with their newborn son without their consent in an anti-surrogacy campaign.
BJ Barone and Frankie Nelson welcomed their son Milo with the help of a surrogate mother in 2014.
A photo taken of that moment went viral, but it was then used by Brothers of Italy in 2016. 
The party has been ordered to pay the couple €10,000 (£8,600) each.
Brothers of Italy - Fratelli d'Italia in Italian - were ordered to pay for the ""offensive use of their image"" after Italian LGBT law firm Gay Lex took on the case. The party is appealing the decision. 
Italian PM Giorgia Meloni leads the most right-wing government since World War Two. 
Brothers of Italy is a direct political descendant of the Italian Social Movement, which was formed by members of Mussolini's Fascist Party after the war.
In March, it instructed Milan's city council to stop registering the children of same-sex parents, leading to protests.
""This is a small win for us, but it is a huge victory for the LGBTQ+ community in Italy and abroad. To us, our birth photo represents everything what we stand for; family, acceptance and unconditional love,"" the couple told the BBC. 
""This victory against the Fratelli and the Prime Minister allows us to reclaim our photo, and show the world that family is about love."" 
The photo, taken by Lindsay Foster, was also used without permission by independent Irish politician Mary Fitzgibbons in 2016 to push her platform against surrogacy for same-sex parents.

Michigan air show: MiG-23 jet crashes moments after two occupants eject,"This video can not be played
Watch: Soviet-era jet crashes during air show in Michigan
Two people aboard a Soviet-era warplane ejected to safety just before it crashed and ""burst into a raging fireball"" during a Michigan air show, officials said.
The pilot and passenger sitting tandem in the MiG-23 jet were operating the plane as part of the Thunder Over Michigan air show on Sunday. 
Parachutes carried them safely to the ground, where they were then sent to the hospital out of precaution.
There have been no reported injuries. 
The crash occurred shortly after 16:00 ET (21:00 BST) on Sunday in Belleville, Michigan, during the Yankee Air Museum's Thunder over Michigan air show, according to a Wayne County Airport Authority statement. 
The jet crashed into unoccupied vehicles in a parking lot at the Waverly on the Lake Apartments, narrowly missing one apartment building, the airport authority said. 
The plane then ""burst into a raging fireball"", as local media described it, shortly before emergency crews arrived to extinguish the flames. Thick clouds of black smoke bellowing into the sky could be seen from the ground.
Video footage of the incident shows two short bursts of flames coming from the aircraft as the pilot and passenger are each ejected.
The cause of the crash remains unclear. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident. 
The old Russian war craft was piloted by Dan Filer, who is a retired Navy pilot from Texas, according to the air show's website. 
""It's the only privately owned flying MiG-23 in the world,"" Mr Filer, who collects Soviet-made fighter jets, told a local news outlet in Louisiana last year. 
The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 was one of the most utilised Soviet war planes during the Cold War, known for its advanced radar and fire control system. It could fire missiles at targets beyond visual range, according to the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

Russian rouble falls to 16-month low against US dollar,"The Russian rouble has fallen to its lowest value in 16 months, falling past 100 per US dollar.
The decline comes as pressure grows on the Russian economy, with imports rising faster than exports and military spending growing for the Ukraine war.
Russia has been targeted with sanctions by Western countries following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
The rouble plummeted after war first broke out, but was bolstered by capital controls and oil and gas exports.
It has fluctuated in value since the war, but has lost about a quarter of its value overall against the dollar since Ukraine was invaded.
Earlier on Monday, the rouble was 101.04 per US dollar. The more roubles per dollar means the currency is weakening, as it will take more of it to buy one US dollar, which is typically seen as the most powerful currency in the world.
Russia's central bank has said that a key interest rate increase is possible, but maintains that it sees no threat to the country's financial stability.
When Russia invaded Ukraine the bank hiked rates from 9.5% to 20%, but began cutting them shortly afterwards.
The current rate is 8.5% and Russia's central bank will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss a possible rate rise.
Jane Foley, managing director at Rabobank London, said the rouble had been ""weakening progressively"" this year, but added ""the pace has picked up since late July"".
""The weakness in the rouble reflects a weakening fundamental backdrop in Russia,"" she added, pointing out that the country's budget was in deficit and it was relying on imports from China and Turkey, but facing pressure over exports.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that Russia's trade, and therefore its economy, was being hit by Western sanctions, ""especially for oil and gas"".
Since the outbreak of war, many EU countries which relied on Russian oil and gas have pledged to wean themselves off imports from the country and find alternative suppliers.
In December 2022, G7 and EU leaders introduced a price cap plan aimed at limiting the revenue Russia earns from its oil exports, by trying to keep it below $60 a barrel. This has played a part in the value of Russia's exports for oil dropping.
Russia also turned off the gas taps to Europe, leading to fears of blackouts. In January, Germany, once a large importer, said it no longer depended on the country's fossil fuels for its energy supply.
""Exports are down, so hard currency inflows are down, and imports are up, and even reliable trading partners such as China appear reluctant to take roubles,"" said Mr Mould.
He added Russia's exclusion from Swift, an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions, had also hit Moscow.
But Mr Mould said that ""rouble weakness must also be set against dollar strength"", with the American currency ""gaining ground against emerging currencies across the board"". 
He said this was partly due to the strength in the US economy, which he said ""is forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in contrast to many emerging central banks, which are starting to cut (notably Brazil and Chile)"".
""Higher returns on cash in dollars and lower ones in other currencies can increase the relative attractiveness of holding greenbacks, or assets denominated in them,"" Mr Mould added.

Hawaii fire: Maps and before and after images reveal Maui devastation,"Hawaiian officials are braced for a significant rise in the death toll from the fast-spreading wildfires, which caused devastation on the island of Maui and destroyed most of the historic town of Lahaina.
Hawaii Governor Josh Green said the fires were the ""largest natural disaster in Hawaii state history"" and that 80% of the beach-front town had ""gone"" - satellite images gave an immediate sense of the scale of the damage.
Your device may not support this visualisation
Hundreds of people remain missing almost a week after the disaster, and search teams have only covered a tiny percentage of the area affected.
The fires are now reported to be under control, but efforts to fully extinguish them continue on some parts of the island.
Hundreds of people who fled their homes in Lahaina have been taking cover in an emergency shelter. About 2,700 homes are reported to have been destroyed.
Incredibly strong winds from Hurricane Dora, which passed south of Hawaii on Tuesday 8 August fanned the flames and prevented aircraft from flying over the town during the fire - but once they had passed, pilots were shocked by what they saw.
""It's horrifying. I've flown here 52 years and I've never seen anything come close to that,"" helicopter pilot Richard Olsten told the Associated Press news agency. ""We had tears in our eyes."" 
The flames destroyed most of the buildings in front of the port, including the old courthouse.
Anger has grown among the community with many people telling the BBC they were not forewarned about the fires. It is currently unclear if early warning systems were used, or if they malfunctioned.
The town's lighthouse has survived but most of the surrounding buildings were destroyed, including the oldest hotel in Hawaii - the 122-year-old Pioneer Inn.
The centre of Lahaina dated back to the 1700s and was on the US National Register of Historic Places - it was once Hawaii's capital.
The town was home to about 12,000 people - the initial assessments say about 86% of the damaged buildings were residential.
Alice Lee, chair of the Maui County Council, told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme how the fire razed the ""beautiful"" Front Street, the town's main strip.
""The fire traversed almost the entire street, so all the shops and little restaurants that people visited on their trips to Maui, most of them are burnt down to the ground,"" Lee said, adding: ""So many businesses will have to struggle to recover,"" she said.
Former US President Barack Obama - who was born in Hawaii - is among those who has expressed his sorrow at the impact of the blaze. He posted on the X social network (formerly known as Twitter): ""It's tough to see some of the images coming out of Hawaii — a place that's so special to so many of us.""
""Michelle and I are thinking of everyone who has lost a loved one, or whose life has been turned upside down.""
The fires also destroyed many natural features on the island - there are fears for Lahaina's banyan tree, the oldest in Hawaii, and one of the oldest in the US.
The 60ft-tall (18m) fig tree was planted in 1873, on the place where Hawaiian King Kamehameha's first palace stood, but it was burnt after fires ravaged the area on Wednesday.
According to the town's website, if its roots remain healthy it will likely grow back. But at this stage, they say the tree ""looks burned"".
Most of the damage was done on Tuesday as the flames engulfed the town. 
The blaze ripped through the town so quickly that some people jumped into the harbour to escape the flames and smoke. 
The flames were fanned by gusts of wind of up to 65mph (100km/h) that hit the islands last week as Hurricane Dora passed about 700 miles (1,100km) south of Hawaii. 
Drought or abnormally dry conditions across large parts of Hawaii - including the entire island of Maui - also played a role.
About 14% of the state is suffering from severe or moderate drought, according to the US Drought Monitor, while 80% of Hawaii is classed as abnormally dry.
Wildfires were once uncommon in Hawaii, ignited largely through volcanic eruptions or lightning strikes. But in recent decades, human activity has made them more common and extreme.
Climate change is increasing the risk of wildfire globally as it drives up temperatures and makes heatwaves longer and more intense.
""We have never experienced a wildfire that affected a city like this before,"" Governor Josh Green said, adding that the challenges of climate change were putting unprecedented strain on Hawaii.

Himachal Pradesh: Almost 50 dead as heavy rains hit Indian state,"Almost 50 people have died in rain-related incidents in the past 24 hours in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.
In one of the deadliest incidents, at least nine people died when a temple collapsed in the state's capital, Shimla.
Officials fear more people may still be trapped beneath the rubble.
Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods in the hill state.
Hundreds of roads have been closed and parts of the Kalka-Shimla railway have washed away. 
Mr Sukha posted on X about a flash flood and cloudburst - a sudden, very heavy fall of rain - that had occurred in other parts of the state, in which 14 people had died.
He also shared a video of the floodwaters in Mandi, where a torrent of water - that looks much like a river - can be seen moving downhill over main roads and houses. He described the video as ""disturbing"" and said seven people had been swept away by the water.
Thousands of tourists visit the hill state of Himachal Pradesh, especially its capital Shimla, around the year to enjoy its cool weather and picturesque scenery. 
But the state has been experiencing heavy rains during the monsoon season, leading to flooding, landslides and cloudbursts which cause further damage. 
Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.
The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.
Videos shared on social media over the past few days show vehicles and buildings being swept away by gushing rivers, trees falling on cars and tourists stranded due to road closures.
Mr Sukhu has appealed to people to stay indoors and not go near rivers.
Incessant rains have also been battering the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand for the past couple of days, where officials fear several people have been buried in landslides. 
The hill state is home to many revered Hindu shrines and sees a large number of tourists around the year.
On Monday, officials said that the Char Dham Yatra - a pilgrimage to the four holiest sites for Hindus in the state -  has been suspended for two days due to the rains.
Videos shared on social media showed huge boulders blocking the path to the Kedarnath temple, which is part of the Yatra.
Environmentalists have frequently raised concerns over infrastructural changes made to accommodate an influx of tourists in India's Himalayan states. They say that this could cause havoc in these ecologically fragile regions, especially when combined with extreme weather events.

Father and son among 5 dead in Pennsylvania home explosion,"A 38-year-old man and his 12-year-old son are among five people killed in a house explosion in Pennsylvania over the weekend. 
The 12 August blast in Plum, a Pittsburgh suburb, left three others injured, including one person in critical condition. 
Three other structures in the neighbourhood were destroyed and at least a dozen others damaged. 
Investigators are working to determine the cause of the explosion. 
According to officials in Pennsylvania's Allegheny County, they received an emergency 911 call at about 10:30 (15:30 BST) local time on Saturday. Police and firefighters ""arrived on scene and reported that there were people trapped under debris"". 
""It appeared as if one house had exploded, and two others were engulfed in fire. Multiple other homes were damaged with windows blown out,"" they said in a Facebook post.
Doorbell camera footage - which has not been independently verified by the BBC - shows a massive explosion sending smoke and debris into the sky above the neighbourhood. 
Five bodies were later recovered from the scene.
Officials say it is still unclear who was home and if any visitors were in the area at the time, complicating efforts to identify the dead. 
""ID is expected to take some time as it will involve use of dental records, and potentially DNA, for formal identification,"" Allegheny County said on X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter. 
While officials have not publicly named any of the victims, family members identified Casey Clontz, 38, and his son, Keegan, 12, as being among the five killed. 
Mr Clontz and his son lived four houses away from the scene of the explosion. It is unclear why they were there, although family members told local news outlet TribLive that they were likely visiting neighbours. 
A statement from the Clontz family described Keegan as Casey's ""shadow"", and the pair often went fishing and hunting together. 
""Keegan and Casey were their most happy when they were spending time at the lake with their lake family and friends. They swam, did boating and loved cruising around in their golf cart,"" the family said. 
Keegan was part of a youth football programme and was due to start junior high in a week. 
Casey and Jen, his wife of 14 years, also had a 10-year-old daughter, Addie. 
Additionally, an online fundraiser has been set up for the Oravitz family, which owned the property where the explosion took place. It is unclear if any members of the family are among the dead. 
Crews from at least 18 local fire departments were needed to douse the flames. More than 50 firefighters were treated at the scene for minor issues, primarily heat exhaustion. 
Local police and fire officials are investigating the cause of the explosion alongside staff from the local utility company and state public utilities commission.
Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the probe will be a ""slow and long process"" that could potentially take months, even years, to complete. 
One resident, Rafal Kolankowski, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the explosion shattered windows in his house and knocked him and his wife down. 
""It's just tragic, I mean, it looks like a war zone — it looks like a bomb hit our neighborhood and it's just unfortunate,"" Mr Kolankowski was quoted as saying. 
""I was just with some of the neighbors yesterday, right, and now this happens.""

Russia rouble: No panic but currency fall will hurt,"If you switch on Russian state TV today, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the Russian economy is booming. 
A presenter on the Rossiya-24 channel did admit that the dollar exchange rate had reached an eye-watering 101 roubles - but, he went on to insist, the Russian economy was still doing marvellously well. Russian GDP - up! Oil and gas revenues - growing! 
And in today's copy of Komsomolskaya Pravda, the biggest-selling daily newspaper in Russia, an article on page 3 declared: ""The Russian economy takes a sharp upward turn.""
But the plummeting rouble will still hurt. 
It is now at its lowest for 16 months. Pressure is growing on the Russian economy, as imports increase faster than exports and military spending grows.
Economists say it will likely lead to inflation. Foreign travel will become more expensive to ordinary Russians. One travel agency owner in Moscow told me he expected many clients would now opt for taking a holiday inside Russia, instead of travelling abroad. 
But going overseas was already very problematic for people here - Western sanctions against Russia's aviation industry make foreign travel very difficult. Many countries have stopped issuing visas for Russians, and financial restrictions mean their bank cards don't work in the vast majority of foreign countries. 
Admittedly, Russia has been here before - the rouble fell steeply after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But then it recovered, prompting President Putin to declare at a meeting just over a year ago: ""The dollar is clearly faltering, and the rouble is strengthening."" 
But some economists here say that rouble exchange rates are now entirely managed by the Central Bank - and that recovery was artificially engineered. 
Chris Weafer, founding partner of Eurasian consultancy firm Macro-Advisory, says last year's economic priority was keeping the rouble's value as high as possible but officials have now chosen to devalue the currency as a means of balancing government spending.
The exchange rate slide therefore reflects these decisions made by officials rather than a specific sign of an ""imminent crisis"" or a broader collapse of Russia's economy, he adds.
In a market in central Moscow, I ask shoppers whether the fall in the rouble will affect them. 
""Of course it will affect me, just like everything that's happening now,"" says Daniil, ""The economy is in the worst possible state. It's a collapse. Nothing surprises me anymore."" 
A lady with bleached-blonde hair tells me: ""The prices are going up. But I think the [dollar rate] is a temporary thing. It'll go down again."" 
Then I meet a man called Maxim, who insists that the exchange rate has no impact on him whatsoever. I ask him whether he has trust in the authorities to manage the economy. 
""Yes of course,"" he says, ""And I have just signed a contract [with the Russian military]. In two weeks I am going to the special military operation [in Ukraine]. As a volunteer soldier."" 
There is no panic in Russia. There are no queues outside banks here. After 18 months of war and isolation, Russians are getting used to bad news. This is the most sanctioned country in the world. 
The country's central bank will hold an extraordinary meeting on Tuesday to discuss a possible interest rate rise, but has said it sees no threat to financial stability. The current rate is 8.5%.
The economy has not collapsed - as many in the West had predicted. The Kremlin still has sufficient resources to maintain tight control over the country.

RAF Lossiemouth fighters intercept Russian bombers north of Shetland,"RAF fighters have been scrambled to intercept two Russian bombers north of Shetland.
The Typhoon jets launched from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray on Monday morning.
The Russian Tu-142 Bear-F and Tu-142 Bear-J aircraft were monitored in international airspace as they passed north of the UK.
Such incidents - known as quick reaction alerts - are not uncommon and involve RAF crews shadowing Russian military aircraft near UK airspace.
Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said: ""RAF crews at Lossiemouth maintain a constant watch over UK airspace and are always ready to take action at a moment's notice to keep our country safe.
""Pilots launched in their Typhoon jets to intercept two Russian long-range bombers this morning, monitoring them as they passed north of the Shetland Islands, ready to counter any potential threat to UK territory."" 
The Typhoons have now returned to their base.

Javier Milei: Trump admirer leads race for Argentina presidency,"Far-right economist Javier Milei, who admires US ex-president Donald Trump, has received the highest share of votes in Argentina's primary election. 
The primary, in which presidential candidates from all parties take part, is seen as a key indicator for the presidential election on 22 October.
Mr Milei exceeded expectations by winning 30% of votes, ahead of more established politicians.
Argentine media have described the result as a ""political earthquake"".
The primary in Argentina differs from those in other countries, since it is not restricted to party members, but open to all those eligible to cast their ballot in the presidential polls. Voting is also mandatory.
Whoever wins the most votes is therefore seen as a favourite for the presidential election on 22 October.
Opinion polls ahead of the primaries had seen Mr Milei trailing behind the centre-left economy minister, Sergio Massa, and conservative candidate Patricia Bullrich. 
But with more than 97% of votes counted, Mr Milei had 30.06% of votes, ahead of Ms Bullrich's coalition with 28.27% and Sergio Massa's coalition with 27.24%.
Newspaper La Nación compared Mr Milei's surge to a tsunami.
Mr Milei is a former TV personality who has studied and taught economics. Despite serving as a Congressmen since 2021, he likes to portray himself as a political outsider.   
His anti-establishment view have endeared him to Argentine voters angry at the current and previous governments for failing to solve Argentina's economic crisis. 
Year-on-year inflation is above 115%, one in four Argentines is living in poverty and the local currency, the peso, has plummeted to such an extent that football fans from rival nations have torn up peso bills to taunt Argentine fans. 
Mr Milei has launched bitter attacks on his rivals from established political parties.
Speaking after the primary on Sunday he told his cheering supporters that ""we have managed to build this competitive alternative that will put an end to the parasitic, thieving, useless political caste"".
The 52-year-old has said that if elected, he would abolish Argentina's central bank, replace the peso with the US dollar and privatise state-run firms which are making a loss.  
In a policy that brings to mind Brazil's former far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, Mr Milei also proposes loosening gun controls.
Mr Milei has also stated that he is opposed to abortion unless the mother's life is at risk and has included a promise ""to protect children's lives from conception"" in his campaign programme. 
He has attacked sex education in schools as a ploy to destroy the ""traditional family"" and is a climate-change denier. 
Sporting long sideburns, singing rock songs and often wearing a leather jacket, the 52-year-old is deliberately provocative and often attacks ""the left"" in expletive-laden outbursts.
His unexpectedly good performance in the primary - 10 percentage points above what opinion polls had predicted - has sent the peso tumbling even further. The official rate fell nearly 18% when markets opened on Monday to just over 350 pesos per dollar.
Mr Milei's success was celebrated rapturously by his supporters, whom he told: ""We are the true opposition, we are the only ones who want a real change, because remember, a different Argentina is impossible with the same old people, with the same old people who have always failed, with the same old people who have been failing for 100 years.""
The candidates who came second and third, Patricia Bullrich and Sergio Massa, will now try to gain ground ahead of the first round of the presidential election on 22 October. 
A second round pitting the top two contenders will be held on 19 November if no candidate reaches the 45% of votes - or 40% with a 10-percentage-point lead - needed to win outright.
With less than four percentage points' distance between the three top candidates in the primaries, a second round currently seems highly likely. 
Argentina is not the first country in the region where an anti-establishment candidate has upset the political apple cart.
In Colombia, independent candidate Rodolfo Hernández surged ahead surprisingly in the first round of the 2022 election, but lost to a former left-wing rebel, Gustavo Petro, in the run-off. 
And in Chile, a far-right candidate, José Antonio Kast, won the first round in 2021, but was defeated by the left-wing former student leader Gabriel Boric in the second round.
In Brazil, supporters of the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, refused to accept his narrow defeat by his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and stormed Congress just days after the latter was sworn in on 1 January 2023.

Maui fire: 96 killed as governor warns of 'significant' death toll rise,"This video can not be played
Watch: Extensive devastation left by Maui wildfires
Ninety-six people are known to have died in wildfires on the Hawaiian island of Maui, with officials warning that figure is likely to rise.
Hawaii Governor Josh Green said more than 2,700 buildings had been destroyed in the historic town of Lahaina. 
Hundreds of people are still missing and search teams have only covered 3% of the affected area.
""None of us really understand the size of this yet,"" a visibly emotional Maui Police Chief John Pelletier said.
The local authorities are focusing their efforts on combing through what is left of the coastal area of the island, as work continues to identify victims.
The fires that started on Tuesday would ""certainly be the worst natural disaster that Hawaii ever faced"", Mr Green warned, adding that the death toll would likely rise ""significantly"".
Meanwhile, it remains unclear if early warning systems were used or if they malfunctioned, with many people telling the BBC they were not forewarned about the fires.  
The state's attorney general is conducting a ""comprehensive review"" into how the authorities responded. 
Representative Jill Tokuda of Hawaii's 2nd congressional district told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme on Sunday that ""serious questions"" needed to be addressed. 
""There's every justification for everyone to feel angry in this particular situation, and we all want answers,"" Ms Tokuda said. 
She also described her visit to Lahaina over the weekend as ""heart-breaking"", saying that ""so many of our families and friends lost everything"".
The fires were fuelled by a dry summer and strong winds from a passing hurricane. 
Mr Green said  gusts from that storm reached speeds of as high as 81mph (130km/h), fanning the flames to travel at one mile per minute and giving people little time to escape. 
While the fires are now largely under control, efforts to fully extinguish them are continuing in parts of the island.

Watch: On board a boat bringing aid to fire-ravaged Maui
Jeremy Greenberg, a senior official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), told the BBC that extra support was being sent included urban search and rescue, and fire suppression teams.
""The absolute number one priority is survivor safety,"" he said. 
Mr Greenberg added that while close to 1,000 people were yet to be contacted, some of these may be safe but out of reach for a number of reasons. 
In the emergency shelter at Maui's War Memorial Complex, hundreds of evacuees continued to gather over the weekend, receiving food, toiletries and medical aid from a still-growing number of volunteers. 
Large whiteboards noted the most pressing needs - batteries, water, and generators - and an all-caps note that no more clothing was needed. 
Keapo Bissen, a member of the War Memorial shelter team, said the list of the missing was fluctuating hour to hour as more people reported absent loved ones, and others were found. 
""We've had a lot of great reunions happen in this parking lot,"" she said. ""That's really been the bright side in all of this."" 
After flying over Maui, helicopter pilot Richard Olsten told the BBC that even most of the boats in the harbour were burnt and had sunk.
""The historic buildings, the church, the missionary building and so forth - all gone.
""The main tourist area where all the shops and restaurants are, the historic Front Street - everything burnt to the ground,"" he said.
Felicia Johnson, who owns a printing business in the city of Kahului, Maui, is organising a massive grassroots response to the disaster.
Her family is from the Lahaina area. She has amassed hundreds of pounds of donated supplies to bring in, but has been unable to shuttle them through the government checkpoint.
She said that pleading with authorities to let her enter with her donated goods was the hardest part for her emotionally - not the devastation she witnessed while dropping off supplies.""That's the part that I'm so wrecked on, is I got to keep begging you to come in to feed people,"" Ms Johnson said.
She added that many of the docks in the area are too badly damaged or destroyed to bring in supplies by boat. Some people that have made the journey have swum the supplies to the shore.
Some of the young men helping her load supplies blame government mismanagement and bureaucracy.
""Too many chiefs, not enough warriors,"" said Bradah Young, 25.
""Everybody is in charge but nobody is moving,"" said another man.
As they departed in hope of being allowed through the checkpoint, one man threw up a shaka, a traditional hand greeting in Hawaii.

Why weren't Maui residents warned about the fire sooner?,"As the scale of the fire's destruction in Maui becomes clear, questions are mounting over whether officials warned residents fast enough.
Local evacuations first took place on Tuesday, followed by an announcement that the flames were ""100% contained"". 
By the following day, however, fast-moving flames had engulfed Maui's Lahaina town. 
About 80% of the town has been destroyed, according to officials. 
At least 96 have been reported dead in Maui County. Hundreds more are missing. 
While some reported receiving text alerts, it is unclear why the warnings were not more widespread. Many residents have reported that strong winds knocked out communications systems hours before the fires arrived. 
Here's what we know. 
We know now that the fires began on Tuesday, but there was no specific warning ahead of it. 
The National Weather Service did issue a number of warnings for strong winds and dry weather that can help fuel wildfires. But that warning was cancelled on Wednesday.
Soon after flames were reported on Maui on the morning of 8 August, officials ordered an evacuation order of an area near a school to the east of Lahaina. 
Shortly before 0900 local time (2000 BST), Maui County's official website put out a statement in which they said that the brush fire had been ""100% contained"", although ""winds in the area remain a concern"". 
Apart from a warning to avoid blocked roads, officials gave no further warnings regarding Lahaina until 16:45 local time, when the county said ""an apparent flare-up"" of the fire had caused the closure of a bypass near the town, as well as some evacuations. 
More evacuations were announced later that afternoon, followed by an emergency declaration by Mayor Richard Bissen before 2200 local time that night. Tourists in some hotels were instructed to remain in place to avoid clogging up local roads. 
By then, flames had already engulfed parts of Lahaina, forcing some residents to flee into the sea. 
Hawaii has what officials have previously touted as the world's largest all-hazard public warning system, which includes a network of over 400 sirens across the state's many islands that can help alert residents and visitors to various kinds of threats. Eighty outdoor sirens are in Maui alone. 
The head of the state's emergency management agency, Adam Weintraub, told the Associated Press this week that records do not suggest that those sirens were triggered on Maui on Tuesday. 
Instead, Mr Weintraub said, officials used emergency alerts sent to mobile phones as well as TVs and radio stations. 
In the wake of the fire, many residents have reported not seeing these, prompting speculation that they came only after widespread power and communications outages occurred on Maui. 
Speaking to reporters on Thursday night, fire chief Bradford Ventura said that the flames - propelled by strong winds - had moved so fast that notifying residents became ""nearly impossible"". 
He added that the first neighbourhoods of Lahaina struck by the blaze ""were basically self-evacuating with fairly little notice"". 
On NBC's Today programme, Mayor Bissen said that the fast-moving flames created an ""impossible situation"" because ""everything happened so quickly"". 
While he declined to comment on whether warning systems functioned or not, Mr Bissen said that 2,100 people were in shelters by Tuesday night. 
At a news conference on Wednesday, Hawaii governor Josh Green said that destruction in Lahaina was ""very difficult to anticipate, especially because it came in the night with high winds"". 
""We don't see any indications that Maui did anything wrong,"" Hawaii Emergency Management Agency spokesman Adam Weintraub told CNN.

Watch: BBC Weather takes a look at how the weather influenced wildfires in Hawaii
In the aftermath of the blaze, many local residents and visitors have reported not hearing any warnings at all until the flames were dangerously close or already sweeping into Lahaina. 
Tee Dang, a 35-year-old visitor from Kansas, told the BBC that she only realised an emergency was taking place when the manager of an Airbnb told her family that they should evacuate. 
""We don't know what to do, so we just grabbed all our stuff...by the time we got in our car, the black smoke was rising,"" she added. Eventually Ms Dang, her husband and three children were forced to flee into the sea to escape. 
""All I grabbed was food, water and a shirt...and we left,"" she said, adding that they were soon caught in traffic amid the flames. ""There were fires in every corner"". 
Lee Munn, a 42-year-old resident of Lahaina, said he was meeting with his neighbours at an apartment complex when strong winds started and he began smelling smoke and seeing soot fall on a window. He soon saw embers falling. 
""At that point everybody started to panic,"" he added. As he packed, the building caught fire around him and ""everything went black"". 
Local man Dustin Kaleiopu told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that he only realised the fire was so close when ""smoke started to come through our windows"". 
""By the time we got in our car, our neighbour's yard was on fire,"" he added. ""There were strangers in our yard with their water hoses trying to put fires out"". 
Carl Cudworth, a 63-year-old Lahaina resident, was one of the few who have so far reported receiving a text alert.
He told the New York Times that the alert - which sounded ""kind of like a fire engine"" - vanished quickly but gave him and his family time to escape Lahaina.

Lakhimpur case: Life in jail for India sisters' rape and hanging,"A court in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has sentenced two men to life in prison for raping and murdering two Dalit sisters last year. 
Two other convicts were found guilty of destroying evidence and were sent to jail for six years each. The convicts are likely to appeal in the high court.
The teenaged girls were found hanging from a tree in Lakhimpur district in September. 
The gruesome crime had made headlines and sparked global outrage.
Police had arrested six people - four of them were convicted on Friday while judgements against two minors are pending.
On Friday, a special court that deals with cases of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) convicted two of the four adults of kidnapping, gangraping and murdering the girls. 
On Monday, Judge Rahul Singh described the crime as ""rarest of the rare"" and said that the two convicts' life sentences would ""run until their last breath"". They have also been ordered to pay 41,000 rupees ($500; £390) each as fine.
The bodies of the two sisters - aged 17 and 15 - were found hanging on 14 September near their home in Tamoli Purva village, just over 200km (124 miles) from the state capital, Lucknow.
Less than 24 hours after the crime, police had arrested all the six suspects.
Police said the girls had been friends with some of the accused and had ""willingly gone"" with them on their bike. They said the accused raped and strangled the girls as they were putting pressure on them to get married and later, hanged them from a tree with the help of their associates.
But the girls' family had questioned the investigation and alleged that the sisters had been kidnapped by the accused from outside their home.
The police claim was also contested by families of the accused who said their sons were innocent.

"Madagascan presidential aide charged with seeking £225,000 bribe in UK","The Madagascan president's chief-of-staff has been charged in the UK with seeking a bribe from a gem mining firm.
Romy Andrianarisoa and an associate are accused of offering the British firm Gemfields licences in Madagascar in return for around £225,000. 
She and her associate, Philippe Tabuteau, have been charged with requesting, agreeing to receive or accepting a bribe.
Both were remanded in custody after a brief court appearance on Saturday,
Ms Andrianarisoa, 46, and French national Mr Tabuteau, 54, are also accused of trying to land a 5% equity stake in any Gemfields Madagascar projects, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA).
The agency said that the pair were arrested in the Victoria area of central London on Thursday afternoon, at a meeting where they were suspected of having attempted to solicit a bribe. 
Andy Kelly, the NCA's head of international corruption, said: ""I am grateful to Gemfields for bringing this matter to our attention and for their ongoing co-operation with the investigation."" 
Ms Andrianarisoa and Mr Tabuteau appeared in court on Saturday and have both been remanded in custody to next appear at Southwark Crown Court on 8 September.
The NCA did not specify what licences the alleged offences related to.

"Australia mushroom deaths accidental, says cook","The Australian woman who cooked a beef Wellington using mushrooms which killed three relatives and left one critical has told police it was an accident.
Erin Patterson, who is not facing charges, has provided a statement of events to police, local media report.
Police believe the victims had eaten death cap mushrooms, which are lethal if ingested. 
In her statement, Ms Patterson said she had used some dried mushrooms but did not know they were poisonous. 
""I am now devastated to think that these mushrooms may have contributed to the illness suffered by my loved ones,"" said the 48-year old.
""I really want to repeat that I had absolutely no reason to hurt these people, whom I loved.""
Her statement to Victoria Police has not been publicly released but was reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Nine Newspapers on Monday.
Australia has been gripped by the mystery over the fatal lunch - held in Ms Patterson's home in the small town of Leongatha, Victoria on 29 July.
Ms Patterson had invited her former in-laws Gail and Don Patterson, along with Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson and Heather's husband Ian. Her estranged husband could not attend last minute.
Hours after the meal, all four guests fell ill with what they initially thought was severe food poisoning.
Within days, Heather, 66, Gail, 70, and Don, 70, had died. Ian, 68, is still fighting for his life in a Melbourne hospital as he awaits a liver transplant.
Ms Patterson was identified as a suspect after the deaths - as it initially appeared that she and her children were unharmed from the meal. At the time, Australian police also said she could be totally innocent.
In her statement reported on Monday, Ms Patterson reiterated her innocence and said she herself had been hospitalised after the meal due to stomach pains.
Speaking to reporters outside her home in the immediate aftermath of the incident, Ms Patterson had stated her innocence - but declined to answer questions about what meals were served to which guests, or where the mushrooms had come from.
""I now very much regret not answering some questions following [my lawyer's] advice, given the nightmare that this process has become,"" she said, in her statement to police. 
""I am now wanting to clear up the record because I have become extremely stressed and overwhelmed by the deaths of my loved ones.""
Ms Patterson said the mushrooms used to prepare the meal were a mixture of button mushrooms bought at a supermarket, and dried mushrooms purchased at an Asian grocery store in Melbourne several months ago. 
Her children, who were not present at the lunch, ate some of the leftover beef Wellington the next day. However the mushrooms had been scraped off the dish as they do not like the fungi, she said.
Ms Patterson said she herself was hospitalised on 31 July. She said she was put on a saline drip and given medication to guard against liver damage.
She said she had also saved and given the remainder of the lunch to hospital toxicologists for examination. 
In her statement she also admitted lying to authorities about a food dehydrator seized by police from a local tip during investigations last week.
She said she had been questioned by her estranged husband as to whether she had poisoned his parents, and so panicked and disposed of the dehydrator as she was worried she might lose custody of their children.

Myanmar landslide: At least 30 missing at jade mine,"At least 30 people are reported missing after a mudslide at a jade mine in northern Myanmar.
The mountainous town of Hpakant in the Kachin state is home to the world's biggest and most lucrative jade mines. 
Many of those affected are believed to be locals digging through the mud along the cliffs, many of whom work and live in abandoned mining pits. 
Lethal landslides are common in the area when heavy monsoon rain pummels Myanmar between May and October. 
At least 162 people died in a landslide in the same area in July 2020, while an accident in 2015 left more than 110 dead. 
Mining operations had been suspended because of the rainy season. However, many of those caught in the accident, which happened at about 15:30 local time on Sunday, were independent scavengers looking to find jade. 
The intense rain had loosened massive piles of earth more than 150m in height, left over from excavations by mining companies, sending the dirt and debris hurtling down the cliff and sweeping up miners on the way.
Survivors have also described a wall of mud, rocks and floodwater overwhelming them as they were digging for jade.
The landscape in this part of Myanmar is scarred with hundreds of unregulated mines. These attract huge numbers of migrant workers from other parts of the country who come to search for jade, most of which ends up being sold in China.
One rescue worker told the Associated Press than 34 people were missing, while eight were injured and were taken to a hospital on Sunday. 
He said the search and rescue efforts were continuing, but some miners had already returned to the scene in the hope of finding jade.
""We haven't found any dead bodies yet,"" said the rescue worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared being arrested by the military.
Jade mining is an important source of revenue for Myanmar's military government. It also finances the Kachin Independence Army, an ethnic armed group. 
For many years, the military and Kachin insurgents have fought for control over this part of the Kachin State because of its jade mines, estimated to be worth some $30bn (£23.6bn) a year. 
There has been frequent fighting there before and after the military coup in 2021, which deposed the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi.

Here's the latest from Russia and Ukraine:
President Volodymyr Zelensky has been visiting troops near the front line in the eastern region of Donetsk.
He met troops involved in attacks on the section of the front line facing Soledar, a Russian-held town north of Bakhmut. 
In a post on his Telegram account, Zelensky said he spoke to a brigade commander about important issues front line soldiers face, including the situation on the ground near Bakhmut and the need for training, weapons and equipment.
Zelensky says while he gets daily general updates on the war, he also wanted to visit brigades individually to understand the specific problems they face.
In his nightly address on Sunday, he praised the ""warriors"" on the front line and acknowledged the role of doctors, nurses and emergency responders.
""Every time we have something to thank our warriors for, Ukraine becomes closer to justice, closer to victory - and Russian murderers on our land become closer to destruction.""
One of the major challenges Ukraine faces during its current counter-offensive is dealing with Russia's anti-personnel and anti-tank mines - which are hidden under the ground and detonate on impact. 
Ukrainian forces have been using innovative means to disable these mines. 
One of them is attaching a device to the front of an excavator to safely detonate them.

adviser blamed “soft monetary policy” for the current weakness of the rouble.
That’s raised the prospect of a possible interest rate hike
sooner rather than later.
You might remember that in the immediate aftermath of
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the introduction of international sanctions
early last year, Russia’s currency plunged to record lows - much lower, in fact,
than it is today.
The central bank responded by more than doubling interest
rates - from 9.5% to 20%. That, along with a raft of government measures, stabilised the rouble and allowed it to regain lost ground.
Across the rest of the year, the bank allowed the cost of
borrowing to fall back steadily, to a floor of 7.5%, in an effort to boost the
war-hit economy.
The government clearly believes that process has gone too far,
and it’s putting pressure on the central bank to ratchet the cost of borrowing
up once again.
It has already done so once - with a one percentage point
hike in July. Now, another increase may be on the cards.
But the bank has a tricky tightrope to walk.
If the currency falls too far, the cost of imported goods
will rise, pushing up inflation and the cost of living.
But if rates go up too far, too fast, it could stifle
growth in an economy already being squeezed by sanctions.
The United States will provide a new aid
package for Ukraine worth $200m (£158m), US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has announced in a statement on Monday.
The package includes munitions for Patriot air defence systems,
artillery rounds, anti-armour weapons, mine-clearing equipment, additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (Himars) as well as demolitions munitions for obstacle clearing.
Blinken said until Russia ended the
war it started, by withdrawing its forces from Ukraine and stopping its brutal
attacks, the US and its allies would stand united with Ukraine, “for as long as
it takes”.
The US Department of Defense (DoD) said the package was the 44th tranche of equipment to be provided to Ukraine over the last two years. Since February 2022, the US has invested more than $43bn in security assistance to Ukraine, the DoD added.
Footage from the State Emergency Services in Ukraine shows the ferocity of the fire at a supermarket in Odesa following Russian drone and missile attacks overnight.
Kyiv said it intercepted the drones and rockets but falling debris damaged buildings.
 Three supermarket workers were injured.

Electronic boards displaying currency exchange rates - and indeed exchange offices - are a common sight in Russian cities.
This means Russians are well used to keeping an eye on the fluctuations of their currency against more stable currencies like the US dollar or the euro.
As such, seeing the rouble's value fall as low as 100 per US dollar is certain to have had a considerable psychological effect on ordinary Russians.
On Monday morning, social media channels were awash with posts captioned ""when you wake up and check the value of the rouble"" featuring various animals looking cartoonishly spooked.
Many Russians closely tracked the fluctuations of the market on Telegram throughout the day.
When, on Monday afternoon, news broke that the rouble had made modest gains, rising to 99 to the dollar, several users reacted with hearts and thumbs-up emojis.
But many others noted the improvement was meagre, with one popular satirical channel sarcastically commenting: ""Take that, damn green paper! Witness how we rise up from our knees!""
The fall of the rouble's exchange rate against the US dollar should not be viewed in the same way as a slide in the currency value for a ""normally functioning economy"", a Moscow-based expert has told the BBC.
Chris Weafer, founding partner of Eurasian consultancy firm Macro-Advisory, says the Russian currency is being ""entirely managed"" by the country's central bank and finance ministry.
He says last year's economic priority was keeping the rouble's value as high as possible to tackle the impact of rising prices in Russia, but officials have now chosen to devalue the currency as a means of balancing government spending.
Weaver says this move was brought in over Western sanctions significantly reducing the amount of money Russia generates from exporting goods - particularly fossil fuels, which are typically bought and sold in dollars. 
The exchange rate slide therefore reflects these decisions made by officials  rather than a specific sign of an ""imminent crisis"" or a broader collapse of Russia's economy, he adds.

Earlier, we reported on how Russia said it had intercepted a cargo vessel, the Sukru Okan, in the Black Sea on Sunday. BBC Verify has
confirmed some of the details of the incident from a video being shared on
social media.
Pre-existing images of the
Sukru Okan match those of the vessel seen in the video. The helicopter hovering over the cargo ship, despite blurry footage, is visibly a Russian KA-29 - a
type that would be carried on the Vasily Bykov patrol
boat that Russia says was involved.
We also know from ship-tracking data that
in the time leading up to the incident, the Sukru Okan gave frequent updates of its movements off Turkey’s Black Sea coast. It then began posting these updates much more intermittently - around the time
the Russians claim to have boarded it.
The vessel has changed its intended destination to Sulina in Romania, and it is currently off the port there. Before the incident,
its destination was set as the Ukrainian port of Izmail, but it’s not clear if it will continue on to Ukraine.
Russia's central bank will meet tomorrow to discuss the key interest rate, the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia said in a statement on Monday. 
The bank, whose key rate is currently 8.5%, had been scheduled to hold its next meeting on rates on 15 September. 
The decision will be announced tomorrow at 10:30 Moscow time (07:30 GMT).
The Russian Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, has been speaking at the Army 2023 Military Expo - an event held in the Moscow region, designed to showcase Russian artillery systems.
""In real-life scenarios, our weapons show reliability and effectiveness,"" he said, according to Reuters news agency.
He added that
""much-hyped"" Western weaponry had shown itself to be ""far from
perfect"" in the course of the fighting in Ukraine.
""The Russian weapon-making industry not only quickly adapted to working under fierce sanctions pressure, but also, its power grew many times over in some areas,"" he says.
Speaking earlier in a pre-recorded address, Russian president Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to cooperate with other countries on military technology - with ""everybody who defends their own national interests"" and those ""who think it is principally important to build an equal security system that would defend every country"".
As we reported earlier, Ukraine has claimed to have recaptured territory around Bakhmut.
It's a city once known for its sparkling wine and salt, but which has now become a symbol of both wanton destruction and fierce resistance. 
The now-devastated city in eastern Ukraine has been the site of the longest and possibly bloodiest battle of Russia's invasion so far. Estimates put the death toll in the tens of thousands.
Bakhmut was subjected to a savage bombing and shelling campaign over the winter, as Russian troops and mercenaries from the Wagner group ground down Ukrainian defences to capture it in May - leaving little of the city standing in their wake.
Military analysts have questioned the area's strategic value to either side, but Bakhmut has become a symbol of resistance for Ukraine and a rare example of battlefield and propaganda victory for Russia.
Ukraine has been attempting to reclaim the city for several months, including through the use of elite special forces sniper known as the ""Ghosts of Bakhmut"" - who you can read about here. 
As a reminder, one of the main developments we're covering today is the Russian rouble plummeting to its lowest value against the US dollar for more than a year.
The exchange rate of Russia's currency has weakened to the point where you would need more than 100 roubles to get a single dollar back - compared to about 60 roubles a year ago.
Pressure is building on the Russian economy generally, with the cost of goods imported into the country rising faster than the money it makes from exports.
That's on top of growing military spending to fund the invasion of Ukraine.
Western sanctions have targeted Russia over the war and the strength of the rouble has fluctuated significantly - but the overall value has dropped by about a quarter since February 2022.
The rouble plummeted after war first broke out, but was quickly bolstered by restrictions on foreign currency transitions - as well as exports of oil and natural gas at inflated prices.
As a result of the rouble's fall, Russia's central bank has said that a key interest rate increase is possible - which would raising the cost of borrowing in Russia - while also saying it sees no wider threat to the economy.

Ukraine correspondent in Kyiv
""We decide what ships go in and out of Ukraine"" is Moscow’s
not-so-subtle message after intercepting a cargo vessel on its way to the
southern port of Izmail.
The ship was forced to stop yesterday after a Russian warship fired
warning shots and soldiers boarded it from a helicopter.
The Kremlin called it an ""inspection"". Ukraine has opted for ""a
breaking of international law"". 
This is the first time a merchant ship has been targeted after the collapse of a major grain deal last month.
It had allowed Ukraine to export grain through an agreed route in the
Black Sea.
Kyiv subsequently announced a new ""humanitarian corridor"" without
any acknowledgement from Russia.
It’s now clearer what the
Kremlin thinks about allowing vessels through the Black Sea.
You can read more about Russia's tactics after refusing to renew the grain deal here.
Another development over the weekend was the boarding of a grain-shipping vessel in the Black Sea by a Russian warship on Sunday - the first instance since the collapse of the Black Sea Grain deal in July.
According to the Russian Defence Ministry, the patrol ship Vasily Bykov fired warning shots on the Sukru Okan after it failed to respond to challenges.
After the collapse of the grain deal guaranteeing safe passage for grain exports, Moscow unleashed waves of airstrikes on Ukraine's major grain ports and storage centres and said all foreign ships in the western Black Sea would be considered possible military targets.
Once the Sukru Okan - a Turkish commercial ship registered in the Pacific nation of Palau - was boarded and searched by the Russian military on Sunday, it was able to continue on its way to port.
Following the incident, Ukraine condemned Russia's ""provocative"" actions as being against international law and called for the global community to do more to protect shipping in the Black Sea.
At least 203 buildings were damaged following attacks in the southern port city of Odesa, the mayor's office said in a Telegram post. 
Among the buildings damaged were four medical institutions including a maternity ward, Odesa's mayor press service added.
Ukrainian forces have said Russia launched a wave of drone and rockets attacks against the city of Odesa overnight. 
Kyiv said it intercepted the drones and rockets but falling debris damaged buildings.

In a market in central Moscow, I ask shoppers whether the
fall in the rouble will affect them.
""Of course it will affect me, just like
everything that’s happening now,"" says Danil.
""The economy is in the worst
possible state. It’s a collapse. Nothing surprises me anymore.” 
A lady with
bleached-blonde hair tells me: “The prices are going up. But I think the
[dollar rate] is a temporary thing. It’ll go down again.” 
Then I meet a man
called Maxim, who insists that the exchange rate has no impact on him
whatsoever. 
I ask him whether he has trust in the authorities to manage the
economy. 
""Yes of course,” he says, “and I have just signed a contract [with the
Russian military],"" he adds.
""In two weeks I am going to the special military operation
[in Ukraine], as a volunteer soldier.”
There is no panic in Russia. There are no queues outside
banks here. 
After 18 months of war and isolation, Russians are getting used to
bad news. This is the most sanctioned country in the world. 
But the economy has
not collapsed - as many in the West had predicted. The Kremlin still has
sufficient resources to maintain tight control over the country.

Reporting from Moscow
If you switch on Russian state TV today, you’d be forgiven
for thinking that the economy is booming.
A presenter on the Rossiya-24
channel did admit that the US dollar exchange rate has reached an eye-watering 101
roubles - but, he went on to insist, the Russian economy is still doing
marvellously well.
Russian GDP - up! Oil and gas revenues - growing!
And in
today’s copy of Komsomolskaya Pravda, the biggest-selling daily newspaper in
Russia, an article on page three declared: ""The Russian economy takes a sharp
upward turn.""
But the plummeting rouble will still hurt. Economists say
it will likely lead to inflation, while foreign travel will become more expensive to
ordinary Russians.
One travel agency owner in Moscow told me he expects many
clients will now opt for taking a holiday inside Russia, instead of travelling
abroad.
But going overseas was already very problematic for people here, as Western sanctions against Russia’s aviation industry make foreign travel very
difficult.
Many countries have stopped issuing visas for Russians, and
financial restrictions mean their bank cards don’t work in the vast majority of
foreign countries.
As Ukraine emerges
from more missile and drone attacks, here are the latest updates:
 
Economists warn of inflation and say it will make foreign travel more expensive for ordinary people.

Taiwan VP a 'troublemaker' for US visit: Beijing,"China has called Taiwan's vice president William Lai a ""troublemaker"" for his ongoing visit to the US. 
Mr Lai, a frontrunner in Taiwan's upcoming presidential election, visited the US on his way to Paraguay. 
Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province, has increasingly voiced its disapproval of meetings between US and Taiwanese lawmakers. 
China on Sunday accused Washington of engaging Taiwan in political activities under the guise of a stopover. 
Mr Lai, a candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was in New York over the weekend. He gave a speech at an informal gathering, pledging to protect Taiwan's sovereignty in the face of ""authoritarianism"". He is scheduled to also stop in San Francisco on his way back to Taiwan later this week.  
The visit from the 63-year-old former doctor, who has previously called himself a ""pragmatic worker for Taiwanese independence"", comes at a low point in US-China relations. Taiwan has emerged as the biggest flashpoint between the two countries.  
Taipei has said Beijing is most likely to conduct military drills near the island this week. 
It's ""very likely"" within days of Mr Lai's return, said David Gitter, a non-resident fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research. 
He said it was a ""a boundary that Beijing once rarely crossed but has done so with increased frequency since [then US House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi's trip last year"". 
Her visit in August 2022 saw China launch its largest ever military exercises in the waters around Taiwan. Then in April this year, Beijing again responded with drills to a meeting between Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California. 
Ms Tsai's earlier visits to the US - in 2015 and 2020, both of which were months before she was elected president - also led to a show of military might on the part of Beijing. 
The ostensible reason for Mr Lai's visit is that he's representing President Tsai at the swearing-in ceremony for Paraguay's newly elected president, Santiago Peña. Paraguay is one of only 13 countries that continues to maintain formal ties with Taiwan
But it's also the moment when Mr Lai steps out on to the international stage, ahead of a crucial election.
China, which views Mr Lai as a Taiwan independence advocate, probably does not want him to win the election next year. However, it's widely believed that Beijing's hard-line tactics against President Tsai ahead of the 2020 election backfired, helping her to secure re-election. 
This time China has a difficult path to tread. While it wants to show its disapproval, it is keen to do so without boosting Mr Lai's image and his message. Instead, analysts say, it may turn up the volume on military intrusions around Taiwan. 
But the average number of intrusions per week is already higher compared to last year. And that rate is being sustained by Beijing, which has made so-called ""grey zone warfare"" - the use of tactics that fall short of qualifying as armed conflict - the new normal, wearing down Taiwan's defences, exhausting its personnel and wearing out its aircraft. 
Some analysts have warned that Mr Lai's remarks may further escalate tensions between Washington and Taipei. 
Mr Lai said that only Taiwan's people can decide their future, and that Taiwan and China are ""not subordinate to each other"". He also stressed that he was ""very willing"" to talk to China to seek peace and stability - common rhetoric in the run-up to the election, as candidates look to gather support without angering Beijing. 
Though the US severed formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979, it has remained a close ally, selling billions of dollars worth of arms under the Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must provide the island with the means to defend itself.
Taiwan regards itself as distinct from mainland China, with its own laws and a democratically elected government. But Beijing, especially under Xi Jinping, has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.

The Ukrainian refugees returning to war-torn homeland,"""You can't imagine this moment until it actually happens,"" Kseniia, a refugee living in Berkshire, tells the BBC what it felt like to return to Ukraine.
This summer is seeing some Ukrainian refugees visiting home for the first time since fleeing the country.
Many are feeling helpless and homesick, and are now spending short amounts of time at home, despite the risk.
Nataly, Kseniia and Oksana, who are living in Berkshire, are amongst those paying visits to their homeland.
""You just see your family and you start to cry"", Kseniia, who went to Lviv in June says.
She describes feeling ""like a guest"" in the city because she could not visit her her hometown of Slavyansk as its only 40 miles from the frontline. 
""[In Ukraine] restaurants [and] shops are working, people are going on holiday [but] at any moment we can get a red alert and the shelling can start,"" Kseniia says.
""I compare it to an abusive relationship. ...you leave it behind [...], you remain stronger, but at the same time you could happily live without this experience.""
She says she hopes in the future people will visit her country not because of the conflict but because it is ""really beautiful"" and ""there are lots of things to try"". 
Nataly, who lives in Newbury, Berkshire, is now in Lviv for the first time since she escaped to England.
She is ""just happy to be home"" with her son and brother, even though going back was ""a difficult decision"" due to safety.
""No matter where, we... are following the news,"" she says.
""You don't feel balanced, you feel either really happy or quite sad once you remember what's going on and how many people have been killed.""
Nataly says that despite the good weather back in Ukraine, spirits are low.
""Even though there are a lot of people around, when you look into the eyes of people, you can see sadness and anxiety,"" she adds.
In July, Oksana and her children travelled back from Sandhurst, Berkshire, to Ukraine.
They took a long train journey through Poland and over the border but were excited and relieved to reunite with their husband and father.

Israelis seek opportunities abroad amid unrest at home,"As tens of thousands of Israelis continue to join weekly protests over the government's highly controversial plans to change the justice system, as many as one in three citizens is thinking of leaving the country, according to a poll.
Professor Chen Hofmann is one of them. Together with his wife and their children, they start the Jewish Sabbath with a meal together every Friday evening. Nowadays they end it at a huge anti-government rally.
""It's not our ritual to go and protest in the streets but we're forced to because we're losing our country, that's how we feel,"" says the doctor, while attending the weekly Saturday night demonstration in central Tel Aviv.
The leading Israeli radiologist is now in the process of moving to a hospital in the UK. Moreover, he is trying to persuade other members of his family, who all have European passports, to consider leaving too.
""I'm going to London for a sabbatical, and this will be my laboratory to see if I can live outside Israel,"" he explains. ""If the situation will be so bad - and it's worsening every day - we'll find a new place to live.""
Among the crowds blowing horns and waving Israeli flags on Tel Aviv's Kaplan Street, there is fury at legislation being passed to limit the power of the Supreme Court. 
Protesters believe it endangers democracy. However, Israel's hard-line governing coalition argues that its actions enhance democracy, by fixing a judicial system in which elected politicians are too easily overruled. 
While the demonstrators still hope new laws can be overturned, many admit that emigrating is something they, or those close to them, have thought about.
""It would be heart-breaking but I will not raise my kids in a country which is not democratic,"" says Sarah, a mother at the protest. 
""If I can't be sure that my daughter's rights as a young woman are guaranteed, we will not stay here"".
Israeli relocation experts say that in the past few months they have witnessed a spike in business. The expected negative economic fallout of the government's judicial changes and rising living costs are also push factors for those seeking to leave.
""We have seen a dramatic increase in the demand for information: we want to move to another country, how do we start the process?"" says Shay Obazanek, a manager at one major firm, Ocean Relocation. ""People with foreign passports who are able to move, ask for advice.""
Ruth Nevo, a Portugal-based relocation specialist, has begun to see Israeli customers for the first time. ""It's been absolutely insane, from none for years to, like, 25 enquiries a day,"" she says. 
""And the people who are enquiring are very well-educated. I'm talking about lawyers, judges, policemen, university lecturers, IT people; they're just very concerned about what's going on.""
International trends suggest that most people who look into emigrating for political reasons do not end up following through. Before and after the election of Donald Trump in 2016, many Americans who had initially threatened to move abroad abandoned their efforts.
However, in Israel, the recent political turmoil has opened up deep social divisions and raised alarm about shifting demographics.
The current coalition government relies on ultra-Orthodox Jews and religious nationalists who have socially conservative values and represent fast-growing parts of the population because of their relatively high birth rates.
Increasingly, as secular Israelis become a minority in the country, they see a threat to their liberal lifestyles. Now they fear the courts will no longer be able to protect their civil rights.
""What I think happened over the last six months was that a slow, incremental demographic process, all of a sudden, became extremely apparent,"" says Professor Alon Tal, head of the public policy department at Tel Aviv University.
He points out that secular Jews continue to shoulder the greatest share of the tax burden in Israel and do most of the compulsory military service, often spending years in reserves. The ultra-Orthodox community benefits from decades-old exemptions from the army.
Professor Tal warns that an exodus, if it happens, could be devastating, with a disproportionate impact on key sectors such as hi-tech, medicine and academia. 
""When the truly talented people, who carry on their shoulders the innovation and the economic development that this country is so dependent on, when they decide they've had enough and they don't want to live in a country that no longer represents them, then we could see a collapse, an economic collapse,"" he says.
At the Sheba Medical Center, just outside Tel Aviv, Professor Hoffmann is poring over the MRI scans of pregnant women. He is one of just four experts on foetal neuroradiology in Israel.
A new survey has just been published in which more than a third of young Israeli doctors and medical students said they planned to leave the country soon. The professor says he also knows a lot of experienced medical personnel, like him, who are looking to head overseas and admits feeling conflicted.
""Even now we have a shortage of doctors,"" he notes. ""So, if you know, even 5% will not come back, it will be a disaster.""
Back at the weekly protests in central Tel Aviv, the national anthem plays out.
The demonstrators see themselves as dedicated patriots. Many are Israeli military veterans or reservists.
Some insist that whatever happens, they will never move away.
""I'm really worried but I'm staying because I feel solidarity,"" says Ruth, a physician who also comes to the protests each week and has previously worked in other countries. 
""This is my responsibility to fight,"" she goes on. ""This is like a second army service for me. We are like an army now.""
Amid loud chants of ""democracy"", the fight continues at full volume to try to force the government to change track on its judicial overhaul.
But at the same time, another challenge is quietly building, with more Israelis drafting their exit plans.

"When a 'fire hurricane' hit, Maui's warning sirens never sounded","Lahaina, once Hawaii's royal capital, is now a crematorium. 
""We pick up remains and they fall apart,"" said Maui County police chief John Pelletier on Saturday, four days after a massive wildfire tore downhill through dry brush and grass and engulfed the island's western edge. 
Close to 100 deaths have been confirmed, making the Lahaina wildfires the deadliest in the US in more than a century. 
But just 3% of Lahaina's charred ruins have been searched so far, stoking fears that the death toll will continue its sharp climb.
""None of us really know the size of it yet,"" chief Pelletier warned, growing visibly emotional.
Dozens of survivors shared their stories of escape and loss with the BBC, helping to piece together a more complete picture of the tragedy that unfolded on Tuesday, when fires moving at a mile per minute consumed the town.
One thing seemed to unite their accounts: residents say they had no official warning before they fled for their lives, raising painful questions about the effectiveness of the emergency response and whether more people could have been saved.
Warning: This story contains details that some readers may find distressing
On Tuesday morning, Lahaina residents woke up to find their power was out. Phones hadn't charged, alarm clocks stayed quiet and air conditioners shut down.
For Les Munn, a 42-year-old resident, the outage announced itself in a dropped call to the country's east coast. He had woken up at 4:00am that day to accommodate the six-hour time difference. Mid-conversation, the connection was cut. 
But the outage alone wasn't especially concerning, Munn said. 
""I just thought it was going to be another blackout,"" he said, noting the trade winds that frequently hammer the coast. 
Munn, like most others, assumed this outage was linked to nearby Hurricane Dora, which authorities had warned could bring gusts of up to 65mph (105kph) to Maui. 
And at that time, the local fires apparently fuelled by Dora's winds seemed insignificant. 
This video can not be played
Watch: Extensive devastation left by Maui wildfires
By 9:55am, officials had declared the Lahaina brush fire ""100% contained"". Residents were given no indication it would flare up again. 
Richard Tenison, a homeless Lahaina resident, woke up to the rushing winds. Standing up near the door of a pharmacy where he had set up for the night, he watched as his bedding was carried by the wind into the harbour. 
The weather was building, said Lynn Robison, who lived in the heart of the historic town. By 8am she got her first whiff of smoke, an odour that would build throughout the day. But at that point concerns were muted. Hawaii was used to storms.
By around 3:00pm, things began to turn. 
Les Munn went outside to take out the trash. He chatted with his neighbours about the ""strange wind"", the gusts growing so fast and so loud they could barely hear each other speak. 
They speculated, incorrectly, that the dust and ash in the air was due to construction. The group separated, peeling off into their separate units in the apartment block. 
Suddenly, the building's smoke alarms began ringing. Residents emptied out of their apartments. Outside, embers had begun igniting the brush around them.
""At that point everybody started to panic,"" Munn said.
Munn ran back inside and tried to grab his wallet, but the heat and smoke forced him to flee with nothing but the clothes on his back. Everything went black. Choking on smoke, he fled to the only thing he could see, the blue lights of a police car, and dove into its back seat. 
Munn hadn't heard a siren alerting him to the fire, and he hadn't received official notice to evacuate. Of the more than two dozen Lahaina evacuees who spoke to the BBC, no one did. 
On Maui, the second largest island in the Hawaiian archipelago, there are 80 outdoor sirens - tested monthly - intended to warn residents of tsunamis and other natural disasters. 
But those early warning sirens had failed to sound, officials have confirmed, a failure now under investigation by Hawaii's attorney general. Some residents told other media outlets they received alerts to their mobile phones early on Tuesday, but the blackout across Maui's west may have limited their reach. 
And in the absence of a wide-scale warning, residents described a frantic rush to escape a fire that seemed to appear from nowhere. 
Some people - both officials and residents - have said the blaze may simply have moved too quickly for any formal response. 
""It was a very fast-moving fire, it was a low to the ground fire,"" said Lori Moore-Merrell of the US Fire Administration on Saturday from Maui. ""It outpaced anything that firefighters could have done in the early hours.""
""The firefighters need to be commended for their actions,"" she added. The governor has also noted most resources on Tuesday had been focused on tackling other wildfires on the island.
Taken together, the accounts from Lahaina residents told of a seemingly instantaneous transformation from a sunny beach town into a site of near-total devastation. Dense black smoke descended as the fire barrelled toward the water, turning day into night. 
The smoke was so thick and so dark residents could not see more than a few feet in front of them, nothing but bright red embers blowing through the air, burning their skin and everything around them.
""You couldn't see through it, people were crashing into each other trying to drive out,"" said Richard Tenison. 
More than 2,200 buildings were razed, the houses, shops and churches that lined Lahaina's streets reduced to molten metal and ash. 
Tenison watched as a friend's large home was incinerated. ""His house went up in 10 minutes. Two-storey house, eight bedrooms… poof,"" he said. ""It just levelled the whole town.""
As he ran to safety in the town's Safeway grocery store, Tenison saw three bodies. ""People were already dead,"" he said.  
For Tee Dang, a tourist from Kansas, the first clue that her vacation had taken a deadly turn came in the form of an Airbnb host barrelling past her door and telling her family to run.
As the fire intensified, Dang sat in traffic on Front Street with her husband and three children. ""It was only 3:30pm or 4:00pm and everything was pitch black,"" she said. ""Everywhere was exploding."" 
When the cars on the road around them began to catch fire too, Dang and her husband grabbed their children and ran for safety in the ocean where they remained for almost four hours. 
The injured family was rescued by a firefighter, who pulled around 20 people from the Lahaina harbour and told them to run towards the town's sport's complex. 
Covered in burns and cuts, it was then that the family would receive their first official order to leave. Of the survivors who spoke to the BBC, many said the same, that the only formal notice from authorities came after they had already begun their escape.
At 4:29pm, Maui's emergency management agency had publicly announced perhaps its first evacuation order, writing on X (formerly known as Twitter) that residents of Kelawea Mauka, a neighbourhood on the edge of Lahaina, needed to leave.
But the notice was overtaken by conditions on the ground. By then, photos and video footage of the town show streets mauled by the inferno.
Steve Strode, one of Les Munn's neighbours, was first told to leave town after he had cycled through flames as tall as 10ft, reaching the relative safety of the Safeway grocery store. After a decade in Lahaina, hearing the blaring alarm tested each month, he did not understand why that same system did not push him to leave earlier. 
Along with Strode and Tenison, several more people would arrive at the supermarket, huddling inside the building's metal structure before police came and told them to evacuate for their own safety. 
For many, that evacuation was improvised, an ad hoc effort by both authorities and locals. 
Residents like Lynette ""Pinky"" Johnson loaded their cars with as many as could fit, before driving eastward along the Honoapiilani Highway - the only viable route to safety - as flames lapped at their wheels. 
""We saw the flames coming. We smelled the smoke. All of a sudden boom boom!"" she said. ""It was the sound of tyres and cars exploding.""
By Sunday, Pinky remained at an emergency shelter at the Maui War Memorial Stadium, a cavernous, echoing gymnasium now filled with rows upon rows of cots and air mattresses, the new home for hundreds of Lahaina's displaced. 
A fleet of volunteers have joined medical workers, physiotherapists, counsellors and translators to assist the thousands of displaced residents. Outside the gym, a large pink poster board advertised a designated missing persons tent where Maui residents can add the list of the missing - estimated to be up to 1,000. 
Identification of the dead will not come quickly. Five days after the blaze, just two of the deceased have been named, easily outpaced by the growing list of fatalities. 
""When we find our family and friends, the remains we're finding are from a fire that melted metal,"" police chief John Pelletier said. ""You have to do rapid DNA testing to identify them. Every one of them [the deceased] are John and Jane Doe."" 
Sniffer dogs trained to detect bodies have been deployed to search for more victims under the rubble, their barks echoing through the devastated streets, now likened to a warzone. 
In the absence of official identifications, most are learning of their dead neighbours and loved ones through Maui's so-called ""coconut wire"", the small island's robust whisper network.  
And many who spoke to the BBC are convinced the number of dead will climb significantly in the coming weeks as authorities continue their painstaking search. 
On Friday, Hawaii Governor Josh Green said the state's attorney general would be leading an investigation into Maui's emergency response policies. But he has mostly defended his government's response, blaming high winds and drought conditions. 
""That fire travelled one mile every minute, resulting in this tragedy,"" he said in a statement on Sunday. ""A fire hurricane, something new to us in this age of global warming, was the ultimate reason that so many people perished.""
Still, many evacuees said they felt they were abandoned. In the days since they escaped, the guilt they carry for those left behind in Lahaina has mixed with growing anger at authorities who they claim could have acted earlier. 
Liz Germansky, who lost her Lahaina home in the fire, said she blamed both the county and state government for the climbing death toll.  
""Whether it be the prevention of it, or the notifications, they could not have done less,"" she said.
Germansky is now suing the government for gross negligence, property damage and emotional trauma. 
Her home, she said, is now a crime scene. ""It was murder"".

Partition: The untold story of the role of aeroplanes,"In his 1974 novel Tamas (Darkness), a vivid portrayal of the bloody partition of India, author Bhisham Sahni vividly depicts the atmosphere changing in a violence-wracked village as a plane circles above it thrice.
""People ventured out. The fighting seemed to have stopped and dead bodies were being disposed. People went back to their houses to assess their losses in terms of clothes and armaments."" 
Sahni wrote a fictional account of the carnage that accompanied the partition as it split the subcontinent into the new independent nations of India and Pakistan. Religious violence erupted, displacing some 12 million people, and claiming the lives of up to one million people. 
Fiction might have been mirroring reality when the planes swooped over the troubled villages, suggests Aashique Ahmed Iqbal, an Indian historian. 
The mere presence of the aircraft, he says, had a deterrent effect, dispersing mobs and giving villages time to prepare their defences. ""The aeroplane played a small, but highly crucial role during the division of the British empire in India into the independent dominions of India and Pakistan,"" notes Mr Iqbal in his fascinating book, The Aeroplane and the Making of Modern India.
Of the 12 million people who fled from India and Pakistan, the overwhelming majority travelled by train, vehicle, cart and on foot. Up to 50,000 people - or less than 1% of the people evacuated - were flown out of what became India and Pakistan, Mr Iqbal says. A near-complete exchange of population was completed in three months, between September and November in 1947.
The Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF) - the aerial force of British India and later the dominion of India - would play a key role in quelling disorder and help in evacuating partition refugees, notes Mr Iqbal.
Every morning, their aircraft embarked on tactical reconnaissance missions, flying over railway tracks to safeguard refugee-laden trains from potential mob ambushes, and checking the rails for any signs of tampering. The planes would also look out for armed mobs and communicate with trains using wireless radio.
In September 1947, aircraft flying over Punjab reported a startling sight: up to 30,000 refugees trekking on foot along a 25-mile (40-km) stretch, as recounted by Mr Iqbal. These planes detected lurking mobs poised to attack weary refugees, relaying their locations to military patrols. They witnessed ominous columns of smoke rising from incinerated villages. ""If you flew low,"" Mr Iqbal writes, ""you would spot bodies floating through Punjab's famous canal system.""
That was not all. RIAF planes - mostly trusty Dakotas - transported 1.5 million doses of cholera vaccines from Delhi to Karachi to help prevent an epidemic in the unsanitary refugee camps. They also dropped cooked food, sugar and oil for refugees. Both India and Pakistan used planes to drop leaflets warning rioters to cease violence, Mr Iqbal writes. The RIAF also ended up evacuating non-Muslims from distant parts of Pakistan like Multan, Bannu and Peshawar. 
In scenes reminiscent of the desperate Afghans who attempted to flee their country by running alongside and clinging to military jets at Kabul airport in August 2021, the airfields of Delhi and Punjab in 1947 also witnessed moments of ""great danger and desperation"".
""Refugees in camps near the airfields would rush to the planes as soon as they were permitted. Passengers desperate to be flown out of danger bribed crew with money and gold to board the plane,"" Mr Iqbal writes.
Tickets were expensive. Passengers were allowed to carry very little luggage: there are accounts of a refugee from Hyderabad in India carrying only her Quran to Pakistan; and others carrying a ""battered child's cane chair"" and a ""moth-eaten-looking parrot"".
Not surprisingly, the planes were packed to the gills. Seats and carpets were removed to accommodate as many refugees as possible. Dakota DC-3 planes meant to carry 21 passengers often carried five times the number. 
A private airline technician was given a pair of knuckle-dusters by his pilot to control the crowds. ""He would punch his way to the door collecting undercarriage pins and punch his way into the plane before firmly locking in,"" Mr Iqbal writes. Once the doors closed, the engines would start. ""Then the crowd would automatically vanish due to the slip stream of the engines.""
That no major crashes were reported because of the overcrowding, lax airport security and overworked planes was remarkable. ""Refugees often crowded airfields before planes landed because of lack of security. Matters were not helped by hostility of the authorities to air crews of the 'other' country,"" writes Mr Iqbal.
By early 1947, India had 115 civilian airplanes run by 11 private companies. The end of World War II had sparked an ""unprecedented boom"" for civil aviation as Indian companies bought cheap aircraft - mostly Douglas DC-3 Dakotas - left behind by the departing US forces. But there was a glut in supply and not enough demand and profits plummeted. During partition, civilian planes not flying on scheduled routes were diverted to ferry refugees from Pakistan to India; and 10 of these planes were made available for the government.
But civilian airline operators were not able to cope with the mass evacuation. They also refused to risk aircraft and personnel for this ""impossible task"". Eventually foreign help was sought: 21 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) planes flew ""non-stop"" for 15 days to move 6,300 people from Delhi to Karachi. They also carried 45,000kg of food, tents and vaccines for Muslim refugees stranded at Delhi airfields. 
Two Royal Air Force transport aircraft deployed to evacuate British nationals were also used to evacuate some 12,000 people between India and Pakistan. Only 2,790 were British personnel; the rest would be railways, post, and telegraph employees who would play a key role in the exchange of population on the ground, writes Mr Iqbal.
By October 1947, India realised this effort was still not enough. This was when 'Operation India' was launched: over six weeks in October and November, 21 planes - mainly Dakotas chartered from eight British companies - transported 35,000 people and more than 1.5 million pounds of baggage between India and Pakistan. Some 170 aviation personnel were flown in from Britain to help. 
Indian aviation companies were overwhelmed by the magnitude of evacuation, so both the governments had to rely on chartered British aircraft. And the use of planes, says Mr Iqbal, ""enabled the rapid constitution of independent India in the crucial first months after Independence"".

Egypt Rabaa killings pain lingers 10 years on,"Ten years ago, hundreds of people, mostly civilians, were killed when Egyptian forces violently dispersed a sit-in protest by supporters of the recently ousted Islamist president. The crackdown on followers of Mohammed Morsi was one of the bloodiest incidents of its kind, and one of Egypt's darkest moments. As BBC Arabic's Sally Nabil reports from Cairo, memories of that day are still raw.
""I wish I was never alive today,"" says Amr, who took part in the sit-in that lasted for nearly 50 days, in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square, in the east of the capital. 
Amr was only 20 years old when he saw ""bulldozers crushing tents, and sweeping whatever came in their way"". 
""Humanity was killed in Egypt on that day,"" he says. 
Amr was arrested a few months after Rabaa, accused of damaging public property and disrupting public order amongst other things. He spent nearly five years in jail, before fleeing Egypt in late 2018 and settling in the UK. 
He says he took part in the sit-in because he feared his country would end up in the hands of the army generals. 
The violent dispersal of the sit-in at Rabaa and of another one at Nahda Square on the same day were not only unprecedented tragedies in Egypt's recent history, but were also gamechangers that reshaped the future of the Arab world's most populous country. 
When Mohammed Morsi, a leading figure in the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood group, was elected in 2012, he was the first civilian to make it to the presidential palace, and via a democratic process. It was an extraordinary triumph for his supporters.   
One year later though, anti-Morsi protestors took to the streets demanding his resignation. They accused him of following an Islamist agenda and failing to be president for all Egyptians. The army, a dominant political player over the past 70 years, was watching. 
Following the protests, the Minister of Defence, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, removed Mr Morsi from power, bringing an abrupt end to the short-lived civilian rule. Mr Sisi himself was elected president a year later and has held the post ever since. 
The Egyptian authorities have always claimed they repeatedly called on the Muslim Brotherhood leaders to end what they called an ""illegal"" sit-in, but that they were ignored. The state saw Rabaa al-Adawiya square as a rebellious zone that had to be dealt with. 
It never occurred to Amr that live ammunition would be used. He thought police forces would resort to much softer tactics like water canon or even tear gas. He said he could not believe how so many lives were lost because of political divisions. 
""Dead bodies were everywhere,"" he recalls. ""We couldn't keep count. We couldn't help one another."" 
His breathing grows heavy as he gives his account of the day. 
""A long queue of civilians, including women and children, were raising up their hands, and leaving the sit-in, when they were shot dead by snipers. I saw them with my own eyes."" 
The authorities said they opened safe corridors for people to leave, before they sent in troops. But in a report, published one year after the dispersal, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said security forces ""besieged demonstrators for most of the day, attacking from each of the five main entrances to the square and leaving no safe exit until the end of the day."" 
Egypt says more than 600 people, mostly civilians, were killed. However, other counts made by the Muslim Brotherhood, now banned in Egypt, speak of more than 1,000. HRW said at least 817 people lost their lives.  
The majority of casualties came from the Muslim Brotherhood camp, but some policemen were also killed. Violence continued for days after the dispersal.  
The mother of one of those officers still feels the pain of the loss of her son.
Mustafa, says his mother, Wafaa, emerged from the chaos of 14 August unscathed. Two days later, he was shot three times in a gun battle as he was heading to a police station in southern Cairo. 
Mustafa was in his 20s when he died in 2016, after being in a coma for three years. During this time, Wafaa never left his bedside in the intensive care unit. 
""People who knew him called him the living martyr"", she says.
She controls her tears as she talks to me about her eldest and closest son.
""We've been devastated, everything is tasteless without him, we are not alive."" 
There is not a single wall in the family's house that does not have Mustafa's photo hanging on it. Wafaa tries to find some solace in her eldest grandson, who was named after his late uncle.  
Since Mustafa died, his parents have suffered ill health, which they blame on their grief.
When I ask Wafaa about the Muslim Brotherhood's claim that the protests were peaceful, she is blunt in her response.
""They are a bunch of liars,"" she says angrily.
Human Rights Watch said the killing in Rabaa ""not only constituted serious violations of international human rights law, but likely amounted to crimes against humanity"". 
The Egyptian authorities have denied all these charges vehemently. The Ministry of Interior said participants in the Rabaa sit-in were armed and posed a serious threat to law and order. 
""Up till today, when I hear police sirens or a helicopter hovering, I can hardly breathe. I instantly remember,"" says Amr, who was arrested a few months after the sit-in and spent about five years in jail. 
He says his whole family have been going through trauma since 2013. His younger brother, who has an amputated leg, is still behind bars, accused of belonging to a terrorist group, and his late father was also locked up for a couple of years, accused of protesting without permission. 
""Even if I have a chance to return to Egypt, the life I once had is gone,"" he says.

Should world leaders start talking to the Taliban?,"Two years since the Taliban swept into power in Afghanistan, not a single country has formally recognised their rule. 
Even engaging with the Taliban government remains deeply controversial. Some say talking with them will help bring about change, others insist the Taliban will never change so there's no point in talking. 
And as the world struggles to decide how to deal with Afghanistan's new rulers, women's rights - even their beauty salons - have become frontlines in political battles. 
Beautician Sakina - in a dimly lit room, curtains tightly drawn, alongside bunches of lip pencils and gleaming palettes of eye shadow - reflects on why she feels women like her have become a bargaining chip. 
""The Taliban are putting pressure on women because they want to push the international community to recognise their rule,"" she says in her new secret salon in Kabul.
She was forced underground two weeks ago after the government ordered all women's beauty parlours to shut. It is the latest in a seemingly endless raft of decrees restricting the lives and liberties of Afghan women and girls.
Sakina is uncertain what approach to the Taliban will work. 
""If the Taliban are accepted as the government, they might remove restrictions on us, or they could impose even more,"" she says, with the kind of uncertainty and anxiety that plagues this huge, sensitive political issue.
The Taliban insist issues like women's rights are none of the world's business. 
""Focusing on this one issue is just an excuse"" says Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesman for the Taliban.
Speaking to the BBC from the Afghan city of Kandahar - home to the Taliban's supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada - he insists that ""the current government should have been recognised long ago. We have made progress in some areas and we will also sort this issue.""
Whether to talk or not to the Taliban government sharply splits many communities with a stake in Afghanistan's future. 
This includes a deeply embittered and still shaken Afghan diaspora, forced to flee their own country when the Taliban swept into power - for a second time - on 15 August 2021. 
""Saying don't talk is easy,"" says Fatima Gailani, one of four women who were on the Afghan team that tried to negotiate with the Taliban right up to the moment they seized power. 
""If you don't talk, then what do you do?"" 
Since the collapse of the last government, she's been involved in backchannel initiatives.
""We don't need another war"", she emphasises, in a nod to voices, including former military commanders and old warlords, who still harbour hopes of eventually toppling the current order by force.
Others in the diaspora are calling for greater pressure, including more sanctions and additional travel bans, to intensify the isolation. 
""What is the point of engagement?"" demands Zahra Nader, editor-in-chief and founder of Zan Times, a women-led newsroom in exile. ""They have shown who they are and what kind of society they want to build.""
Diplomats involved in dialogue emphasise that engagement is not recognition, and concede there is little to show so far. 
But signs of dissatisfaction, even among senior Taliban leaders, with the most extreme edicts imposed by the ageing ultra-conservative supreme leader, keep kindling faint hope. 
""If we don't engage Afghans who want to engage, in the smartest possible way, we'll give free reign to those who want to keep a large part of the population essentially imprisoned,"" says a Western diplomat involved in recent meetings with mid-level Taliban representatives. 
Sources point to a recent unprecedented meeting between the reclusive Akhundzada with Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani - the supreme leader's first with a foreign official. Diplomats briefed on the discussions say they confirmed wide gaps, especially when it comes to education and women's rights, but also indicated a possibility to find a way forward, however slowly. 
Discussions are tough - it's hard to find common ground. 
""There's a lot of distrust, even disdain, between sides who fought each other for years,"" says Kate Clark of the Afghanistan Analysts Network. ""The Taliban think the West still wants to corrupt their nation and the West doesn't like the Taliban policy on women's rights and their authoritarian rule.""
Ms Clark highlights a fundamental disconnect: ""The West may see issues like recognition as concessions, but the Taliban see it as their right, a God-given right to rule after they defeated the US superpower and returned to power, for a second time.""
Outside powers balance criticism with praise for progress, such as a crackdown on corruption which boosted revenue collection, and some efforts to tackle security threats posed by the Islamic State group. And Western powers look to Islamic countries and scholars to take the lead on shared concerns over the Taliban's extreme interpretations of Islam.
But there is also a toughening of tactics. 
Even the UN now speaks of ""gender apartheid"" as the Taliban tighten the vice around women by even banning them from public parks, women's gyms and beauty parlours. Moves are now underway to develop a legal case for ""crimes against humanity"".
Despite some mixed messaging and occasional friction between regional and Western countries, so far there's a rare meeting of minds among world powers, including Russia and China on some red lines, including recognition.
The impasse has devastating consequences for ordinary Afghans. 
The UN's latest report highlights, in bold letters, that their humanitarian appeal is only a quarter funded as of the end of July, as donors turn away. More and more Afghans are going to bed hungry. 
Some 84% of households are now borrowing money just to buy food, the UN says.  
And there is concern too that the footprint of Islamist groups like Islamic State is growing. 
The Taliban government paints a rosy picture. And, even without recognition, their envoys - in signature traditional turbans and tunics - are among the world's most frequent flyers, jetting to meetings in many capitals. 
The acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi receives delegations in Kabul almost daily, with all the usual protocol, including flags and official photographs set in elegant rooms.
Western embassies in Kabul remain shuttered, except for a small European Union and a Japanese mission. Discussion goes on about whether diplomats now based in the Gulf state of Qatar should at least be in Kabul if they want to exercise any influence at all. 
There's no appetite, in any of the world's capitals, for another bloody chapter in this 40-year war. 
And despite any discord among Taliban leaders, their unity remains a goal which matters above all else. 
There are no quick or easy solutions. 
""The only thing I could say from my heart is that we are really suffering,"" says the beautician Sakina. 
""Maybe those who are not among us don't understand it, but it's really painful.""

Ecuador: Thousands of soldiers move gang leader Fito,"Thousands of Ecuadorian soldiers and police have been involved in a dawn operation to move a notorious gang leader to a maximum security jail.
Jose Adolfo Macias, known as ""Fito"" is accused of sending death threats to Ecuador's murdered presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio.
The anti-corruption campaigner was shot three times in the head leaving a campaign rally on Wednesday.
Before his murder Mr Villavicencio said he had been threatened by Fito.
""If I continue... mentioning Los Choneros [the gang], they are going to break me,"" he said.
His death has shocked a nation that has largely escaped the decades of drug-gang violence, cartel wars and corruption that has blighted many of its neighbours. Crime has however shot up in recent years, fuelled by the growth of Colombian and Mexican drug cartels.
On Sunday, his Construye party announced Christian Zurita, another journalist, would replace Mr Villavicencio as its presidential candidate.
This was a reversal from Saturday when the slain politician's running mate, Andrea Gonzalez, had been named. 
Mr Villavicencio's widow Veronica Sarauz said she held the state responsible for her husband's death that she was unhappy Ms Gonzalez had been named as her husband's replacement. 
Mr Villavicencio's campaign focused on corruption and drugs. He was one of the only candidates to allege links between organised crime and Ecuadorian government officials. 
The day before his assassination, he complained to the Public Prosecutor's Office about alleged irregularities in oil contracts negotiated during former president Rafael Correa's administration which had cost the country US $9bn (£7 bn).
Six Colombians have been arrested in connection with the murder, while a seventh was killed in a shootout. The authorities have not said who hired and paid the hitmen.
Gang leader Fito had been held in Prison 8 in Guayaquil since 2011, and videos shared by security forces showed him handcuffed in his underwear as security forces moved him to another facility.
Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso said Fito had been moved to La Roca, a 150-person maximum security prison that is part of the same complex.

Ukraine war: Three-week-old baby and family among seven killed in Russian shelling,"A baby aged just 22 days, her 12-year-old brother and their parents were among seven people killed by Russian shells in southern Ukraine on Sunday.
Bombs hit their family home in the village of Shyroka Balka in Kherson, Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said. 
The dead also included another village resident and two men in neighbouring Stanislav.
""Terrorists must be stopped. They must be stopped by force,"" said Mr Klymenko. ""They don't understand anything else."" 
The minister shared photographs of the aftermath of the attack on Shyroka Balka, showing black columns of smoke rising from buildings, and the digitally obscured bodies of some of the dead. 
Thirteen others were injured in the shelling, he added.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky used his daily address to the nation to condemn the ""brutal"" attack in Shyrokа Balka.
""Five people were killed,"" he said. ""Among them was a baby girl, only 22 days old. Her brother, just 12 years old. The mother Olesia... only 39, also perished."" 
He added there had been 17 reports of Russian shelling in Kherson alone, and many more beyond.
""There is no day when Russian evil does not receive our entirely just response,"" he said. 
""We will not leave any of Russia's crimes unanswered."" 
Kherson was one of four regions in Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed to have annexed last year.
Ukraine's military reclaimed the western part of the region in November. Russian troops have continued to shell the area from across the Dnipro river.
The shelling came a day after Moscow accused Kyiv of ""terrorism"" for what it said was an attempted missile strike on the Crimean Bridge linking the peninsula to Russia.
Ukraine has not confirmed the attack, although Mr Zelensky has previously said the bridge is used as a military supply route and is a legitimate target.
Crimea has been under Moscow's control since Russian forces annexed the peninsula in 2014 - a move condemned internationally. 
In another development, Moscow said it had fired warning shots at a cargo ship in the southwestern Black Sea to halt it for an inspection as it made its way to the Ukrainian port of Izmail on the Danube river.
The Russian claim has not been independently verified. If confirmed, it would be the first time Russia has fired on merchant shipping beyond Ukraine since exiting a landmark UN-brokered grain deal last month.
Russia said that its Vasily Bykov patrol ship had fired automatic weapons toward the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan when it refused to halt, then boarded for an inspection.
Meanwhile, an aide to the exiled Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol reported that several Ukrainian civilians were killed as Russian soldiers fought among themselves on Sunday. 
Two teenage girls, four young men and a woman were among the dead in the ""shoot-out"" in the village of Urzuf, Petro Andryshchenko said in a Telegram post. 
He said the gun battle followed an argument between Chechen troops and personnel from the  local commandant's office.
Mariupol, a major port on the Sea of Azov, was captured by Russia after months of fierce fighting last year.

Ukraine war: Three-week-old baby and family among seven killed in Russian shelling,"A baby aged just 22 days, her 12-year-old brother and their parents were among seven people killed by Russian shells in southern Ukraine on Sunday.
Bombs hit their family home in the village of Shyroka Balka in Kherson, Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said. 
The dead also included another village resident and two men in neighbouring Stanislav.
""Terrorists must be stopped. They must be stopped by force,"" said Mr Klymenko. ""They don't understand anything else."" 
The minister shared photographs of the aftermath of the attack on Shyroka Balka, showing black columns of smoke rising from buildings, and the digitally obscured bodies of some of the dead. 
Thirteen others were injured in the shelling, he added.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky used his daily address to the nation to condemn the ""brutal"" attack in Shyrokа Balka.
""Five people were killed,"" he said. ""Among them was a baby girl, only 22 days old. Her brother, just 12 years old. The mother Olesia... only 39, also perished."" 
He added there had been 17 reports of Russian shelling in Kherson alone, and many more beyond.
""There is no day when Russian evil does not receive our entirely just response,"" he said. 
""We will not leave any of Russia's crimes unanswered."" 
Kherson was one of four regions in Ukraine that Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed to have annexed last year.
Ukraine's military reclaimed the western part of the region in November. Russian troops have continued to shell the area from across the Dnipro river.
The shelling came a day after Moscow accused Kyiv of ""terrorism"" for what it said was an attempted missile strike on the Crimean Bridge linking the peninsula to Russia.

Cambodia: Thousands of war-era explosives found buried at high school,"A high school in north-eastern Cambodia has been forced to close temporarily after thousands of unexploded munitions were discovered. 
Cambodia remains one of the world's most heavily mined countries, 48 years after the end of its brutal civil war. 
At that time, the Queen Kosomak High School in Kratie province was being used as a military station.
Photos show tons of rusty explosives neatly stacked in rows, with grenades and anti-tank launchers among them.
In total, more than 2,000 pieces of ordnance was discovered over three days - Heng Ratana, director general of the Cambodian Mine Action Centre, told AFP news agency. 
He said the munitions were found when the ground was being cleared to expand a garden, and if the whole school was cleared, more would likely be dug up.
""It is a huge stroke of luck for the students. These explosive devices are easy to explode if someone dug into the ground and hit them,"" Mr Heng said.
Students were told to stay away from the school until the clean up was complete, which was expected to take two days.
Cambodia's eight-year civil war ended in 1975, however it continue to suffer from the aftermath. 
Landmines that are scattered across the country have killed more than 64,000 people, while 25,000 amputees have been recorded since 1979, according to The Halo Trust.
The Cambodian government has vowed to clear all landmines and unexploded artillery by 2025.

Ministers face renewed pressure over boat crossings,"Ministers are facing renewed pressure to tackle boat crossings in the Channel after six migrants died when a vessel sank off the French coast on Saturday.
Labour said people smugglers were ""running rings"" around the government, and a Tory backbencher said the UK had a ""moral duty, both to our own citizens and... asylum seekers, to act"".
The government has made ""stopping the boats"" one of its five priorities.
Investigations continue into the incident which saw 59 people rescued.
The overloaded vessel, which got into difficulty and capsized 12 miles (20km) off Sangatte, was said to be one of a number of migrant vessels which set off in the hope of reaching the UK.
The incident happened in French waters at about 04:00 local time, with British and French teams working together to rescue the migrants.  
The people on board were reported to be mainly Afghan with some Sudanese.
More than 100,000 migrants have made the perilous journey across the Channel in small boats in the last five years. and more than 500 arrived on Saturday.
A new law, the Illegal Migration Act, is central to the government's plans to stop small boats crossing the Channel. It aims to deter people from making such journeys by detaining and removing those who do.
But plans to do this by sending some of them to Rwanda, to claim asylum there, is still subject to legal challenge. 
Shadow cabinet minister Bridget Phillipson told BBC Breakfast: ""The events in the Channel are absolutely tragic.... and demonstrate why we need much tougher action to crack down on criminal gangs that are exploiting people, putting them in harms' way"".
She said saying convictions had fallen for people smugglers under the current government and accused ministers of presiding over a Home Office which was ""increasingly shambolic and completely incompetent"".
Ms Phillipson added a ""better, fairer system"" was needed to address a backlog of asylum applications ""that is completely out of control"". 
Calls for action have also come from within the Conservative Party. Backbench MP and ex-party chairman Sir Jake Berry said ""only radical changes can truly turn the tide"".
Writing in the Sunday Express, he called for the UK to leave the European Convention of Human Rights, which he claimed would continue to block ""any and all attempts to stop the boats"".
Refugee charity Care4Calais said the incident was an ""appalling and preventable tragedy"", while the Refugee Council warned ""more people will die"" unless more safe routes to the UK are created.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who chaired a meeting with UK Border Force officials on Saturday, said the deaths were a ""tragic loss of life"".
Conservative minister David TC Davies says the government has already stopped ""a lot"" of boats and insisted the controversial Rwanda policy was a solution. He said it would ""take away the incentive to jump into rickety boats"".
A government spokesman said Labour was ""cynically using the deaths"" to make ""cheap political points"".
Labour was not offering any solutions, they said, while the government was ""determined to break the people smuggling gangs' business model and save people's lives"".
The government has also struck an agreement with France, under which the UK will pay £500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. 
A Home Office spokesperson said the Nationality and Borders Act, which came into effect in April 2022, was ""beginning to have an impact on the exploitative business model of people smugglers"", with more than 650 people arrested.
French authorities have in the past pointed to the English Channel's long coast line as making it extremely difficult for the coastguard to prevent all small boat crossings.
On Saturday, 509 people made the journey across the Channel to the UK, government figures show, bringing this year's total to 16,679. 
The English Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world, with 600 tankers and 200 ferries passing through it every day. 
French authorities said the migrant boat was first detected by a commercial vessel, before a French patrol boat was dispatched to the boat in distress.
French sea minister Hervé Berville said: ""While we mourn these victims... it is the responsibility of human traffickers - of criminals - who send young people, women, adults, to their death on these maritime routes that are dangerous and lethal.""
Investigators are looking for any information that might lead them to the smuggling gang which organised the crossing.
Aid workers in Calais say more migrants have been arriving in recent weeks and have been living rough on the coastline. They say many of them are determined to get to the UK, despite warnings over the dangers of the crossing. 
The pressure on the ministers follows criticism after 39 asylum seekers had to be moved off the Bibby Stockholm barge moored off the Dorset coast because of the discovery of Legionella bacteria in the water supply.

New Zealand's youth vaping crisis clouds smoke-free future,"""It got more accessible for me, so I got addicted. Everyone around me was vaping at the time.""  
Coco, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, was 12 when she vaped for the first time. She's now 15 and trying to quit.  
""She was angry,"" she said, as she smiled at her mother sitting nearby. ""My phone was taken away from me.""
Coco had never brought the vapes home, but as she grew more used to the habit, she also wanted to vape after school.
""What attracted me to it was more the flavours like 'Peach ice' or 'Lychee-grape'.  You can find vapes inspired by video games, they come in bright colours and flavours like bubble gum and candy floss,"" she said.    
It's illegal to sell vapes to under 18s in New Zealand, but Coco said that never stopped her or her friends.
""The older kids sell to the younger kids and lots of shops don't check IDs,"" she said.  
""You can just walk in there and say 'I want strawberry, raspberry, watermelon' and they'll sell it to you. You can even go in your uniform and they just don't say anything,"" she added. 
New Zealand is on target to becoming smoke-free by 2025. This means being cigarette and tobacco free and that's where vaping comes in. For long-term adult smokers, it's seen as a less harmful alternative but the flipside to that is the exponential rise and accessibility of vaping to teenagers and at times younger children. 
According to data released last year, the number of teenagers in New Zealand who vaped regularly had tripled between 2019 and 2021. 
The government has defended vaping, arguing that evidence is growing that vaping can help people quit smoking. But at the same time it has acknowledged the sharp rise in youth vaping, and has implemented new rules.
The new regulations include banning most disposable vapes, not allowing new vape shops within 300m (900ft) of any schools, and enforcing generic flavour descriptions. There are no rules however to regulate the vast variety of the flavours themselves.  
Vaughan Couillault, principal of Papatoetoe High School in South Auckland and president of the Secondary Principals' Association of New Zealand, has a number of confiscated vape pens in his office.
""Strawberry ice-cream"" reads one of the labels on a disposable vape that looks like red lipstick. ""Pineapple ice"" was another that looks like a bright yellow lighter. 
""'Pineapple ice' is not targeting a person who's been smoking for 30 years,"" Mr Couillault said.  
He has witnessed first-hand how schools have become the epicentre of vaping - a lot of which he says is aimed at youngsters. 
""It's a lifestyle object. They'll have a phone in one pocket and a vape on the other. It's sleek. It looks modern. In terms of a product and marketing perspective, some genius work has been done,"" he said.   
""But it's not helping young people. It might be helping people get off smoking, but there's far too many young people who never would've picked up or thought about picking up a cigarette who now have two or three vapes,"" he added.  
This is now the habit of choice for millions of young people around the world.  
""There are probably more teens that do vape than don't at school, and they pack out the bathrooms,"" Coco said. ""And when the colourful flavours came out, that just got every kid on it.""
Marni Wilton said many vape shops had popped up recently around her Auckland suburb close to her sons' local schools. 
""Whichever gates the kids come out of there's a vape shop,"" she said, pointing to a store just 60 metres away from a primary school.  
Like many mothers, Ms Wilton is worried about how prevalent vaping has become. She co-founded a voluntary group called Vape Free kids with other equally concerned parents.   
Ms Wilton said the new government regulations fail to address the problem: ""This absolutely doesn't go far enough to help our children.""
""We have over 7,500 vape shops in New Zealand now. The new laws do nothing to affect the existing stores that are already built. So many are close to our schools, our playgrounds - they're in those safe spaces,"" she added. 
Neighbouring Australia has taken a hard-line approach, moving to ban recreational vaping and making it prescription only.  
Ben Youdan, who has worked in tobacco control and campaigning for nearly 20 years both in the UK and New Zealand, said banning vaping only drives it to the black market rather than get young kids off it.  
""It's a phenomenon that is happening whether you ban it or not,"" he added.  
Mr Youdan is now director of Ash NZ, a lobby group campaigning for a smoke free New Zealand. He said when discussing vaping one should not lose sight of the bigger picture.  
""There's no doubt that our smoking rates have benefited hugely from tens of thousands of people switching from smoking to vaping. We've seen smoking rates here drop by a third in the last two or three years. It really is unprecedented,"" he says.
Mr Youdan acknowledged that a by-product of that was the ""explosion of the vape market"".  
""We've seen a lot of vape shops that are about 'making money quick' rather than to responsibly support adult smokers quit smoking. We allowed that to happen by being far too slow to regulate the vaping market,"" he said.  
He added that while a number of youths have become vape-dependent and need to be treated, there's a large spectrum of teens who are also experimenting. ""Not all kids are addicted,"" he said.  
Around the world, it's become a tough balance to strike: parents and families who want to see fewer youngsters vaping, and governments who want to see fewer adults smoking. 
One thing is for certain: it may have started as a solution to cigarettes, but vaping has now created its own problem.

World famous Yeovil glove maker Pittards looks for buyer,"A world famous leather company, which makes gloves for the royal family and emergency services, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators.
Pittards, based in Yeovil, Somerset, was founded in 1826 and has tanneries in Ethiopia.
In July, the company told stakeholders it had not managed to secure necessary funds and was looking to find a buyer.
The company said the recent pound crash, rising interest rates and inflation have caused difficulties.
A spokesperson from Pittards said: ""On 8 August 2023 Pittards filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators to provide protection against creditors whilst a buyer for the business and assets is sought.""
They added that Pittards currently continues to trade.
Chief executive of the group, Reg Hanky, took over the business in 2007.
The firm had been aiming to crowdfund through corporate investors to raise £1.16m in capital.
It was part of a deal to secure millions more in overdraft funds with its bank over the next two years.
But it did not hit its target, instead raising just over £300,000, which will now be returned.
Marcus Fysh, the MP for Yeovil, said he would be working to see what could be done to preserve the business.
""This business is very significant because it's been here since 1862. It's the last of the old gloving businesses in Yeovil,"" he said.
""Some might know that Yeovil in the 19th Century had an 80% market share globally in glove making."" 
Mr Fysh said he had been trying to help by speaking to the Department of Trade and Industry to see if there might be trade finance solutions to get the business through.
He added that hundreds of jobs in the UK and Ethiopia depend on the business continuing.
Correction Monday 14 August: Article amended to make it clear that the company has not gone into administration but has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators.

Miss Universe Organisation cuts Indonesia ties over sex abuse claims,"Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has cut ties with its Indonesian franchise after several contestants alleged sexual abuse days before the pageant's crowning ceremony in Jakarta.
Contestants said finalists were unexpectedly asked to strip for ""a body check for scars and cellulite"" and some said they were photographed topless. 
The US-based MUO said it was clear the franchise had not lived up to its brand standards, ethics, or expectations.
Jakarta police are probing the claims.
MUO also said it was also cancelling this year's pageant in Malaysia which is run by the same company, PT Capella Swastika Karya.
Miss Universe Organisation thanked the women that filed the complaints for their bravery and reiterated ""providing a safe place for women "" was its priority. 
It said it was evaluating its policies and procedures to avoid similar occurrences and said there were no measurement or body dimensions requirements to join its pageants worldwide.
""In light of what we have learned took place at Miss Universe Indonesia, it has become clear that this franchise has not lived up to our brand standards, ethics, or expectations,"" MUO posted on Saturday night.
Miss Universe, which is now on its 73rd edition, is popular in South-east Asia, especially in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, where winners go on to become celebrities and social media influencers.
Its owner Anne Jakrajutatip, a Thai transgender woman and media mogul, has sought to revamp the brand to make it more inclusive by allowing married women, transgender women and single mothers to compete.
Poppy Capella, Indonesia's franchise director said on Instagram that she had ""never known, ordered, requested or allowed anyone who played a role and participated in the process of organizing Miss Universe Indonesia 2023 to commit violence or sexual harassment through body checking"". 
She also added that she was against ""any form of violence or sexual harassment.""
Indonesia's Ms Fabienne Nicole Groeneveld who who won the contest to represent her country in the 2023 Miss Universe finals in November will compete with the organisation's support, MUO said.

Fires in Maui: 'Tourists swim in the waters we died in' - Maui resident,"This video can not be played
At least 93 people have died in the wildfires that razed the historic town of Lahaina, making it the most deadly fire in the US for a century.
When the wildfire tore through the town last week, many people jumped into the sea to escape the flames. 
One Maui resident told the BBC's Sophie Long that she was upset some tourists on the island have been carrying on with their holidays as normal. 
""The same waters that our people just died in three days ago are the same waters the very next day these visitors - tourists - were swimming in.""

Ecuador murder: Fernando Villavicencio's running-mate steps in to contest election,"The running-mate of a murdered Ecuadorian politician is to contest the presidential election in his place.
Fernando Villavicencio was shot three times in the head after a campaign rally in Quito. Police say all suspects are Colombian.
His Construye party said it would put Andrea Gonzalez forward as its presidential candidate.
The party added that it was in the process of choosing a vice-presidential candidate for the August 20 election.
Ms Gonzalez, 36, whose career has mainly focused on environmental issues, is due to take part in Sunday's presidential debate in the capital.
The party said on social media that she would ""guarantee the legacy"" of Mr Villavicencio ""and millions of Ecuadorians will accompany her in this purpose"".
The candidate for the vice-presidency would come from ""the most trusted of those who have shared the struggles of comrade Fernando Villavicencio"", the party added.
Mr Villavicencio, 59, a former journalist and member of the country's national assembly, was shot three times in the head as he left a public event in the capital on Wednesday. 
One attacker was killed in an exchange of fire with police while several others escaped.
His death has shocked a nation that has largely escaped the decades of drug-gang violence, cartel wars and corruption that has blighted many of its neighbours. Crime has however shot up in recent years, fuelled by the growth of Colombian and Mexican drug cartels.
Mr Villavicencio's campaign focused on corruption and gangs, and was one of only a few candidates to allege links between organised crime and government officials in Ecuador. 
On Saturday, his widow, Veronica Sarauz, told a news conference that she held the state responsible for her husband's death.
""The state still has to give many answers about everything that happened, his personal guards did not do their job,"" she said.
""I do not want to think that they sold my husband to be murdered in this infamous way.""
Ms Sarauz also expressed her displeasure that Ms Gonzalez had been named as her husband's replacement to contest the presidential election. 
According to Interior Minister Juan Zapata, six Colombians have been arrested, who were members of organised criminal groups.
Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso has called on the FBI to help investigate Mr Villavicencio's death. 
Meanwhile, three men considered highly dangerous by Ecuador's authorities have been moved from a jail in the port city of Guayaquil where they were inmates in a maximum security prison.
They included Jose Adolfo Macias, known as ""Fito"", the leader of one of Ecuador's main organised crime groups from whom Mr Villavicencio said he had received death threats.
Mr Villavicencio, who was married and had five children, was one of eight candidates in the first round of the election - although he was not the frontrunner and was polling around the middle of the pack.
Patricia Villavicencio, his sister, said ""this crime can't go unpunished... We are hurting, with a broken soul, there is no justice, there is no protection"".

Migrant boats in the Mediterranean: Why are so many people dying?,"In grainy photographs shot from a plane circling overhead, four people adrift in a small, metal boat in an expanse of the Mediterranean Sea wave their arms in distress.
It later emerges that the group - a 13-year-old boy, two men and a woman - are the only survivors of a shipwreck that they say killed the other 41 people they were travelling with.
The four survived by floating with inner tubes and lifejackets until they found another empty boat, likely from a previous migrant crossing, and clambered in. They spent several days drifting before being rescued.
A day after news of the tragedy emerged, migrants in the Tunisian city of Sfax prepared to make the same crossing.
One man, who had fled fighting in Sudan's western region of Darfur, told BBC Arabic that he planned to seek asylum in Tunisia, but was ready to board a boat if this didn't work. ""I just survived a war, I have nothing to lose,"" he said. Another, from Kenya, dreamed of a better life for his family in Europe.
If they go ahead with the journeys, the two men will join thousands of others who have risked their lives this year on what has been dubbed the world's most dangerous migration route.
Experts told the BBC that badly designed and overcrowded boats, stormy weather, and gaps in international efforts were all factors in the danger - and one search-and-rescue NGO described the central Mediterranean as a ""cemetery"".
If it feels like you are seeing more reports of shipwrecks this year in the central Mediterranean, then both crossings and deaths do appear to be on the rise.
People making the journey set sail from the shores of North Africa, usually for Italy.
European border agency Frontex says the central Mediterranean is the ""most active route"" into the European Union, and that reported crossings are at their highest since 2017.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has recorded more than 1,800 migrant deaths in the central Mediterranean so far this year, compared to 1,400 for the whole of 2022.
Among the migrant shipwrecks this year was an overcrowded fishing vessel off the coast of Greece, which killed hundreds in one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the Mediterranean in recent years.
The IOM says there is strong evidence that many shipwrecks are ""invisible"": unrecorded boats disappearing with no survivors, meaning the real death toll is likely to be much higher.
Those embarking on the perilous voyage come from around the world and have various reasons for wanting to reach Europe, from fleeing war or torture, to searching for jobs.
After being rescued from an overcrowded rubber raft this summer, one 16-year-old boy from the Gambia told the BBC he left home three years ago to ""hustle hard and help my family"". 
He was aware of how dangerous the journey was, having lost an 18-year-old friend to the crossing, but he said this did not deter him - his friend had ""lost his life for his family and his society and his nation"".
This year, Tunisia has overtaken Libya as the main point of departure - amid a wave of racism against black Africans.
Some say the Libya crossing remains more dangerous, both for geographical and political reasons.
""In terms of fatalities, I think that the opening up of the Eastern Libya route (from territories controlled by Wagner-supported militias) is having a bigger impact,"" said Nando Sigona, a professor at the University of Birmingham, and a migration expert. 
""It is much longer and it also brings boats at the border between Italian and Greek national waters - two governments currently not too keen to be seen as providing rescue operations to migrants at sea,"" he said, citing the Greek shipwreck in June by way of example.
Migrants are typically travelling on overcrowded and unseaworthy boats, with limited flotation devices should they capsize.
Types of boats include rubber rafts and fishing vessels - on the Tunisian route, metal boats are common. 
Frontex spokesperson Chris Borowski described them as ""coffins in water"".
""Combine this with the fact that usually there are dozens of these launched at one time with 40 or more people on board and you have a recipe for disaster,"" he said.
Mr Borowski said that ""greedy people smugglers"" used metal boats to offer ""discount"" crossings as they competed for migrants' business.
Crossings are seasonal, with more attempts in the summer. But weather can be unpredictable and successful journeys can take days.
""If storms occur - or the seas are rough - which may become more frequent with climate change, there is a much greater risk to life,"" IOM spokesperson Ryan Schroeder said.
""Sometimes not even bad weather deters smugglers from sending people out to sea,"" he added, pointing to the boats that recently capsized near the island of Lampedusa, which were launched despite rough seas.
And Mr Borowski says poor weather makes spotting boats in distress even more difficult. 
""Imagine searching for a Vauxhall Corsa from the air in an area the size of the UK. Now try looking for a dozen or more in the open sea,"" he said. 
""This is the daunting challenge in the central Med. This, combined with an unforgiving sea - especially when the weather turns bad - as we have seen in recent days.""
While Frontex offers ""general oversight and technical support"", Prof Sigona says national governments mostly govern search and rescue (SAR) operations in the central Mediterranean.
The IOM's Mr Schroeder said SAR efforts are no longer as ""proactive, comprehensive or adequately resourced"" as they were during the big Mare Nostrum rescue operation led by Italy in 2013-2014.
Under the current system, Mr Schroeder said the IOM was concerned that ""SAR gaps, alleged delays in rescue, and reported lack of response to distress calls may be contributing to tragedies on this route"".
NGOs operating rescue vessels on the central Mediterranean were more critical. The route has become increasingly deadly ""because of a reckless policy of deterrence and neglect that European states have been pursuing for years"", Wasil Schauseil, communications co-ordinator at SOS Humanity, claims.
German NGO Sea-Watch said the EU had ""willingly created a cemetery"".
It said there was a lack of SAR co-ordination and that ""illegal pullbacks"" were being conducted by the Libyan coastguard, which the EU has equipped and trained. In addition, last month, the EU signed a $118m (£90m) deal with Tunisia to try to reduce ""irregular"" migration.
A European Commission spokesperson defended working with the North African countries, saying the ""still too high number of casualties"" in the Mediterranean meant it was ""important to continue strengthening the capacity of the Libyan coastal authorities to carry out effective search and rescue operations, in line with international standards"".
NGOs have also criticised a new law in Italy requiring their rescue vessels to head to often distant ports after an operation, rather than continuing to patrol for more boats in distress. They say this reduces their time in areas where shipwrecks are more common.
Italy says the aim is to spread arrivals across the country.
Critics of rescue NGOs say their presence encourages migrants to embark on the potentially fatal journey - the NGOs reject this.
Frontex's Mr Borowski acknowledged that ""we can, and indeed, we must, do better"" at stopping ""tragedies at sea"", calling for ""shared solutions"". IOM spokesperson Mr Schroeder said all efforts should ""focus on saving lives and addressing the reasons that people are compelled to risk their lives"". 
The IOM and other UN agencies have called for co-ordinated European search-and-rescue operations in the central Mediterranean, and for safer legal pathways for migration and asylum to prevent deaths at sea.
The European Commission spokesperson said its efforts to enhance SAR co-ordination between its members were ""extensive"". It was working to deter smugglers and develop safe ways for people to come to the EU that would break ""the business model of the smugglers and the traffickers"", the spokesperson said.
Shipwrecks, like the one this summer off the coast of Greece, are ""yet another call to action"" that highlighted ""the urgency to intensify our work"".

Nelson Chamisa: The comeback preacher who wants to be Zimbabwe president,"With all the drama of the Pentecostal preacher that he is, Zimbabwe's main opposition leader Nelson Chamisa can work a crowd.
He will now put that charisma to the test in the general election on 23 August when he will once again face President Emmerson Mnangagwa after losing to him in a disputed poll in 2018.
Mr Chamisa will run for the presidency under the banner of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), the party he formed last year after he was thrown out of what used to be the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).
It came after a vicious power-struggle broke out in the party following the death of its founding leader Morgan Tsvangirai. 
Mr Chamisa was accused by his MDC rivals of staging a coup to wrest control of the party, and as the battle became increasingly vicious he was evicted from the party's headquarters, and lost a court battle where his claim to the leadership of the party was challenged. 
It marked a low point for Mr Chamisa, but he made a comeback with the formation of the CCC. The string of victories it notched up in parliamentary by-elections was heralded by his supporters as a yellow revolution - a reference to the party colours.
On the campaign trail he has sounded optimistic about his prospects, despite saying that the political field is tilted against the CCC, with little access to state media, and an electoral commission he says is staffed by ruling party supporters. 
However, President Mnangagwa has said the elections will be free and fair. 
The 45-year-old's campaign has focused on his relative youth, with supporters chanting the Shona language slogan ""ngaapinde hake mukomana"" meaning ""let the boy in"". 
But it remains to be seen if he can defeat 80-year-old Mr Mnangagwa, known as the ""crocodile"", who has been in politics longer than Mr Chamisa has been alive.
Still hugely popular among urban and youth voters, Mr Chamisa is credited with transitioning into his own brand of opposition politics in the last two years and creating an identity divorced from the man he regards as his mentor, Mr Tsvangirai. 
""Creating a formidable opposition in a short period of time has been his greatest victory,"" says political scientist Alexander Rusero, 
Like the late Mr Tsvangirai, being the face of the opposition has made him a target. Mr Chamisa says 63 meetings have either been banned by police or disrupted - potentially a preview of the upcoming elections. 
Moreover, members of his party have been arrested and convicted in what Mr Chamisa describes as fabricated charges aimed at weakening the CCC.  
He says he has faced threats to his life, which have made him extremely cautious and mistrustful - including escaping an alleged assassination attempt in 2022 when his convoy came under attack during by-election campaigns. He also suffered a cracked skull during a clampdown on the opposition in 2007. 
He has previously told the BBC that he rarely eats at public events, for fear of getting poisoned.
An ordained church pastor who graduated from Living Waters Theological Seminary in 2016 and a practising lawyer, Mr Chamisa's social media timeline is filled with political commentary and biblical references in almost equal measure. 
His almost Baptist-like charisma has served him well on the campaign stage, but some say it has come at the expense of substantive policy and a coherent political game-plan.  
The CCC follows what Mr Chamisa calls ""strategic ambiguity"". It has not held an elective congress, and has not unveiled its party structures or constitution. It prefers to call itself a broad-based citizens' movement, rather than a political party.  
""Our [by-election] wins shows that it is organised and is not a one-man band,"" according to CCC spokesperson Fadzayi Mahere.  
But some of his former supporters, among them social media influencers, are increasingly frustrated.  
Mr Rusero believes that Mr Chamisa appears to be intimidated by the ruling party, opting to confront them on ""social media, with bible verses and misplaced optimism"", instead of in real life.
He thinks the opposition candidate has missed opportunities to wage a robust campaign in the face of allegations of rampant government corruption and public discontent at the spiralling cost of living. President Mnangagwa has previously promised a zero tolerance approach to graft. 
In 2018, in his characteristic way, Mr Chamisa told the BBC that he was a young man trying to bring about alternative politics on the African continent and that he wanted to replace strong men with strong institutions. 
It was a reference to the personality cult that had developed around former President Robert Mugabe, a common phenomenon in Zimbabwean politics.
He too has not been a stranger to controversy. During the last presidential campaign, he boasted he had met Rwandan President Paul Kagame and been central in crafting a digital strategy that had been key to Rwanda's economic success. 
However, Mr Kagame rebuffed this, tweeting that he had no clue who Mr Chamisa was and had never even had a discussion with him.
He has also been labelled as sexist after telling voters he would marry off his then-18-year-old sister to President Mnangagwa if his rival only won 5% of the vote in the 2018 election.
He later said it was just ""political banter that I used to illustrate that even if I promised to give him my most prized possession, he would still not be able to defeat us in a free and fair election"".
In the 23 August poll, Mr Chamisa is hoping to emulate the victory of long-time Zambian underdog Hakainde Hichilem, who lost every presidential election since 2006, until he finally won in 2021. 
But it is unclear whether Mr Chamisa has enough resources and support to win, especially when the playing field is tilted in favour of Mr Mnangagwa, whose Zanu-PF party has maintained a tight grip on power since independence in 1980. 
However, he remains the hope for millions of Zimbabweans who believe that it is time for younger people to lead the nation. 
Update 13 August 2023: The introduction to this piece has been changed to reflect that Nelson Chamisa is not known primarily for his designer wear on the campaign trail.

Mutanjan: The meat-and-rice dessert loved by Indian royals,"It's a chilly evening in the northern Indian city of Lucknow, the erstwhile seat of the Nawabs of Awadh.
We are in the courtyard of Lebua Lucknow, Saraca Estate, a 1930s estate-turned-boutique-hotel, seated around a table groaning with excess. There are flatbreads sprinkled with poppy seeds or brushed with saffron, smoky kebabs and Lucknowi biryani - a delicately flavoured dish of rice and meat cooked in sealed pots.
But the highlight of the evening, Chef Mohsin Qureshi tells us, is a dessert ""you have never had before"". 
What he served up next seems familiar at first. 
Delicate grains of saffron-hued rice, strewn with cashews, raisins, almonds, makhana (fox nuts) and crumbs of khoya (dried milk solids), and topped with flecks of varq (silver leaf).
The scent of saffron and spices mingles with the nutty notes of cashews and almonds fried in fragrant ghee. The dish is strewn with shreds of deeply seasoned yet subtly sweetened meat. 
""This is mutanjan,"" Mr Qureshi beams. ""There was a time when the dish was a must on a connoisseur's table on Bakrid,"" he says. 
Mutanjan is now hard to find - but it's worth finding if one can, as it defies boxes and is anything but ordinary. 
The word mutanjan comes from the Perso-Arabic word Mutajjan which means to be 'fried in a pan'. It is popularly believed that mutanjan is a dish of Middle Eastern descent. However, the genre of dishes called mutajjan in medieval Arab cookery has little in common with the sugar-laced rice-and-meat dish of the Indian subcontinent.  
For instance, one variety is spinach fried in sesame oil and finished with garlic, cumin, dry coriander and cinnamon, while another is a dish of boiled eggs that are first fried whole and rolled in a mix of spices and salt. On the other hand, the 16th Century Persian dish called mutanjan, considered a favourite of the Safavid Shah Abbas the Great, was a braised meat stew.
In the book Qadeem Lukhn'ow Ki Akhiri Bahar, author Mirza Jafar Husain writes about 13 gifts that he believes old Lucknow bestowed on the world. Among these he named the delicate mutanjan.
Historians have also documented how food served for dinner or sent out to people from the Nawab's house always featured mutanjan, among other delicacies.  
But the dish perhaps came into the Nawab's household from the Mughal Badshah's royal kitchen.
Abu'l Fazl, the grand vizier of the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar, mentions mutanjan in his writings, among dishes served at the royal table.
Historian Salma Husain, the author of book The Mughal Feast, a ""transcreation"" of the 17th Century Mughal manuscript Nuskha-e-Shahjahani (Shahjahan's Recipes), points out that it too features a recipe for mutanjan pulao from the royal kitchen of the Mughal emperor. 
Earlier still, the 14th Century Arab chronicler Shihabuddin-Al Umari who described India under Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq in his book, mentioned mutanjan among dishes sold in the bazaars of India - an egalitarian street bite enjoyed by the masses, rather than a sophisticated delicacy reserved for royalty.
The mutanjan might have evolved from other dishes in the Arabic or Persian repertoire that combines sugar, rice and meat. Al-Warraq's 10th Century book, Annals of the Caliphs' Kitchen, features a dish of rice cooked in milk along with subtly spiced chicken and finished with honey. The Indian mutanjan pulao is also evocative of  the Persian Morasa Polow or jewelled rice that packs in shreds of chicken breast along with barberries, pistachio, raisins and orange peel. 
Like most things in the Indian subcontinent, there is no linear narrative around the mutanjan or its origins. The dish is not only proof of the fluidity of cultural exchange but also the complex ways in which food travels and evolves. It is clear, however, that the subcontinental mutanjan pulao, albeit interlaced with numerous strands of foreign and indigenous influence, evolved over time to acquire a distinct identity in the form of a pulao. 
And there's no one way to make mutanjan or mutanjan pulao. Take for instance, the mutanjan from the princely state of Rampur in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
Author Tarana Hussain Khan in her book Deg to Dastarkhwan describes it as a dish of sweet and savoury rice studded with sweet gulab jamun and meatballs. ""The recipe calls for sugar four times the weight of rice,"" she writes. Khan believes that the mutanjan was imported into Rampur's royal kitchens via Awadhi cooks who were specially employed for this. But Rampur's royal kitchen added its own insignia to the dish by replacing bite-sized chunks of meat with meatballs. 
For Muslims of the Indian subcontinent, mutanjan is a special dish, layered with cultural memories and emotions. ""In some parts of the country, particularly in the Saharanpur area of Uttar Pradesh, it was once customary to send along a massive handi of mutanjan when a new bride left her parents' home for her husband's,"" says Husain. ""A sweet and salty dish, with a hint of tang from a twist of lime, perhaps represented the mixed emotions that such an occasion evokes,"" she adds.
Across the border, in neighbouring Pakistan too, ""mutanjan is never a casual dessert affair - I have only seen it served at weddings, religious festivals (urs, milad) or as part of langar. It's certainly considered a special dish"", says Pakistani food blogger Fatima Nasim. But there's no meat in the Pakistani mutanjan, at least not in the version that's popular nowadays.
Instead, it's a multicoloured spectacle - a carnival on a plate. A bed of pristine white grains of syrup-soaked rice is offset by a bright pop of colours from a mix of dyed rice and comes studded with dried fruits and nuts, tutti frutti, glazed cherries and chamcham - sugary orbs of cottage cheese, in pastel hues - and crescent slivers of toasted coconut. Some versions are even finished with slices of boiled egg. 
It is not easy to find a good mutanjan today. The dish is often confused with zarda (sweet, yellow rice) and other sweetened rice dishes. Luckily, a few people still make the dish. Husain, on the other hand, recommends placing an order at the Babu Shahi Bawarchi's Bhatiyarkhana near the Old Fort in Delhi, where one Hafiz Miyan turns out fragrant pots of luscious mutanjan on request.

'Don't Ask Why': South Korea grapples with back-to-back 'Mudjima' stabbings,"A knife darting out in a packed subway car. An assailant, chasing shoppers, stabbing wildly in the street.
These nightmares have played out in the minds of many South Koreans following a mass stabbing attack last week - the country's second in as many weeks.
On 21 July, a man attacked commuters in the capital, killing one person and stabbing three more at a subway station. He later told police he lived a miserable life and ""wanted to make others miserable too"".
Then, on 3 August, 14 people were injured in Seongnam, south-east of Seoul, when a man rammed his car into pedestrians near a subway stop, and then ran into a department store, where he stabbed nine people. One woman died later from her injuries.
The second attacker, Choi Won-jong, 22, was a delivery driver and high-school dropout who had been diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder. Police said he had googled news about the first attack before his own rampage.
""What's happening in South Korea these days?"" cried citizens online afterwards - dazed by back-to-back stabbings in a nation known otherwise for low rates of violent crime.
""Our country used to be one of the safest in the world… but recently I can't say that any more,"" one commented on YouTube.
In South Korea, they are known as ""Don't Ask Why"" or Mudjima crimes - inexplicable acts of violence targeting strangers, driven by no personal link to victims or obvious motive.
While they've been called Mudjima by the public for years, it was only in 2022 that South Korean police officially designated such crimes as a distinct category: ""Abnormal Motive Crimes"".
With specific definitions and a task force set up to combat them, the move appeared to show authorities finally taking the crimes seriously. In the first half of this year, police recorded 18 Mudjima acts.
While overall data shows no rise in violent crime - South Korea last year in fact recorded its lowest rates in a decade - the recent stabbings have driven the perception that Mudjima acts are more common, and society more dangerous.
It has even led to some commentators making comparisons with the US, with online remarks: ""It's the American mentality that's going viral in South Korea"" and  ""OMG South Korea has become the USA of Asia"".
Experts reiterate, however, that South Korea remains a very safe country. ""Murder and other violent crime rates are very low compared to other countries, and they have been steadily declining in the last 10 years,"" said Prof Hyojong Song, a criminology expert at Korea University in Seoul.
South Korea's homicide rate - down to 1.3 murders per 100,000 people - is half the average of OECD nations, and less than a fifth of America's murder rate. And there are strict gun controls. 
Many online said the crude comparisons to the US mask what authorities need to do locally: ""They need to take a look at South Korea's own social issues that have led to this,"" one user wrote.
While the details surrounding the perpetrators are still sketchy, the little revealed so far has already fuelled public anger.
""These days there are jobless losers who are taking their ills out on everybody else,"" one user wrote on Tiktok, in a vein of commentary which has become common online.
Another, on Youtube, argued that ""in the past, only psychopaths would do something like this, but now we are living in a world where ordinary people are becoming murderers. People don't have hope, the sense of panic is high and sense of happiness is low.""
Experts have pointed to underlying social pressures in South Korean society - from unstable job prospects and housing, to a continued stigma around mental health and a lack of support services. Police said Choi had not received adequate treatment.
""Fundamentally, I think we need to have some emotional and instrumental social support systems or policies that can help those who are disconnected from society, with no social bond,"" Prof Song told the BBC.
What drove greater anxiety among the public after last week's stabbing was the wave of threats that popped up, vowing copycat attacks.
Online posts stated specific timings and locations, and some even named the gender of the victims they wanted to kill.  One person vowed to ""kill as many people as possible.""
Although many dismissed them as the work of juveniles and attention seekers, they succeeded in unnerving people. 
On social media, users posted warnings for the weekend of 4-6 August: ""Please avoid these areas in South Korea"" was one TikTok video which drew more than 300,000 views across Asia.
""Go ahead and screenshot this- here's a list of public stabbings on the weekend,"" the host, a North American expat in Seoul, says in the video. Several subway stations were named as attack spots - as well nightlife areas, an amusement park and a women's university stop.
""Be careful, be mindful of surroundings and stay safe out there,"" they say.
In response, police mounted a ""special enforcement"" operation for the weekend, dispatching thousands more officers to public sites. They were told to stop and search ""suspicious-looking"" people- at least one person was arrested after he was seen carrying knives in public.
Authorities also moved in on the online threats, tracing people across the country through internet service addresses and tip-offs.
Following the weekend operation, police identified nearly 200 threats and arrested about 60 people - 34 of whom were teenagers, several aged 14 or under and not liable for prosecution.
One 17-year-old boy was detained for making a stabbing threat at a train station in Wonju, then reporting it to police as a tip-off.
In another case, a 14-year-old was arrested outside the subway station he had listed as a target. He had told police he had no murderous intent, but was ""bored, and posted it as a joke"".
As more and more days pass without incident, some of the immediate public tension is fading.
However, fear remains on the edge of people's minds. More people are carrying protective weapons, like mace sprays. And on subway platforms and in other crowded areas, more are staying vigilant and wary of those around them.
Last Saturday, exuberant fans on a night train returning from a BTS member's concert sparked a near stampede, when their excited shrieks were mistaken for terror. Passengers who ran away said later they felt like they'd been in a zombie film.
A web service set up to map online threats drew more than 50,000 views in its first days of operation last week, local media reported. The service is still recording new threats each day.
On Wednesday, Korean media also reported police had identified the poster of an online threat within eight minutes of it going out. The ""acts of terror"" have fuelled political discussion around cracking down on crime. 
Lawmakers in the past week have promised harsher criminal punishments for mass stabbings, lowering the age of criminal responsibility and amending laws to justify heavy-handed police action. On Monday, the country's justice minister said the use of force by police should be considered self-defence.
An editorial this week in the Korean Herald summed up many people's feelings: ""It is deeply shocking to witness such violent crimes committed in a country known for a relatively high level of public safety.
""A thorough investigation to identify the specific motives of the horrifying crimes should be carried out. At the same time, police must take steps to prevent copycat crimes.""

Migrant boat sinks in Channel killing six people,"Six people have died after a boat carrying migrants sank in the Channel, off the French coast.
The French coast guard said the vessel got into difficulty in the sea near Calais in the early hours of Saturday. 
Fifty-nine people - many of them Afghans - were rescued by French and British coastguards, officials said. But the search for two people who may still be missing has been called off. 
Some people were seen being brought off a lifeboat in Dover on stretchers.
The extent of injuries remain unclear and the exact numbers of those rescued changed during the day as more information was released.
The six people who died were Afghan men thought to be in their 30s, the AFP news agency reported Philippe Sabatier, deputy public prosecutor for the French coastal city of Boulogne, as saying. 
He said those rescued included some children and were mostly from Afghanistan, although there were some Sudanese.
The French coastal authority Premar said a passing ship first raised the alarm at around 04:20 local time that an overloaded boat was in difficulty off the coast of Sangatte.
When the French lifeboat arrived, they found people in the sea, with some screaming for help. 
The Dover lifeboat, which was already in the Channel dealing with another boat carrying migrants, joined the rescue operation at 05:50. 
One of the volunteer rescuers told the Reuters news agency migrants were using shoes to bail water out of the sinking boat.
Anne Thorel said there had been ""too many"" people on board.
Another French rescuer, Jean-Pierre Finot, said: ""Some were suffering from sea sickness and the boats are quite simply overloaded... [and] can no longer move forward"".
Rescue crews say this is the seventh time this week that they have had to pull people from the water, raising concerns that the smugglers organising the crossings may be using a defective batch of boats.
In its latest update, French officials said interviews with survivors suggest 65 or 66 people were on the boat. Often boats are so overloaded it is difficult to tell how many people are on them. 
Premar said 23 people were taken to Dover by UK rescue crews and a French boat took 36 to Calais. 
Two French boats were still searching for the two people who could still be missing, it added.
A French Navy aircraft and a helicopter had been deployed to help the search.  
The MP for Calais, Pierre-Henri Dumont, said authorities are interviewing the migrants who are able to speak and not too unwell, to establish what happened and where they are from.
Although the incident happened in French territory, with these types of operations, British and French rescue teams work together to rescue as many people as possible. 
Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, thanked the rescuers for their efforts but urged the UK government to work on creating an ""orderly and humane asylum system"".
The English Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world, with 600 tankers and 200 ferries passing through it every day.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman called what happened a ""tragic loss of life"".
A UK government spokesperson said the deaths were ""devastating and our thoughts are with the victims' families and friends at this time"".
They added: ""This incident is sadly another reminder of the extreme dangers of crossing the Channel in small boats and how vital it is that we break the people smugglers' business model and stop the boats.""
Dover MP, Natalie Elphicke, said the incident highlighted the need for joint patrols on the French coast.
""These overcrowded and unseaworthy death traps should obviously be stopped by the French authorities from leaving the French coast in the first place,"" she said.
On X, formerly known as Twitter, shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said it was an ""appalling, deeply shocking tragedy"".
Another small boat also got into difficulty on Saturday but all on board were rescued, the UK Coastguard said.
Meanwhile, people from other migrant boats that had made successful crossings could be seen being brought ashore at Dover during the day. 
In the last two days more than 1,000 people made the journey across the Channel to the UK, government figures show. More than 100,000 migrants have crossed in small boats since 2018.
At least 27 migrants died after a dinghy sank while heading to the UK from France in November 2021, the highest recorded number of deaths from a single incident. 
Four people died at sea while trying to cross in December 2022.
The incident comes after the UK government faces pressure over fears of a Legionella outbreak on its new migrant barge, Bibby Stockholm, moored in Portland Port, Dorset. The first migrants to board the vessel had to be removed after bacteria was found in the water system.
Today's tragedy is a reminder of one thing that unites all parties when it comes to immigration policy at the moment - nobody wants people making the very dangerous route across the channel in small boats. 
But people still are, and in great numbers. 
The government is insisting it wants to push on with its plans to house some asylum seekers on barges like the Bibby Stockholm - and with its plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, which is still subject to legal challenge. 
Two of its flagship policies are currently stalled. But the bigger overarching question for ministers, yet to be established, is will they work? 
And will, as ministers suggest, reducing the ""pull factors"" be enough to stop people from making this dangerous journey when some are already not deterred by the very real risk of harm?

Fukushima nuclear disaster: Activists march against Tokyo's waste plan,"Hundreds of people in South Korean took to the streets of Seoul on Saturday to protest against Japan's contentious plan to release treated nuclear wastewater into the Pacific Ocean.
Tokyo is set to release the water from the tsunami-hit Fukushima nuclear plant later this month.
It has been approved by the UN nuclear watchdog, and a South Korean assessment found it meets international standards.
But protesters fear marine life will be destroyed and seafood contaminated.
Marching in central Seoul, they held signs reading ""Protect the Pacific Ocean"" and ""Nuclear Power? No Thanks!"".
Choi Kyoungsook of activist group Korea Radiation Watch said radioactive substances in the water ""will eventually destroy the marine ecosystem"". 
""The sea is not just for the Japanese government, but for all of us and for mankind,"" she said.
Last month, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), published a report endorsing Japan's plan.
A few days later, South Korea released its own assessment that found that discharging the water should ""not have any meaningful impact on our ocean areas,"" according to government minister Bang Moon-kyu.
However Japan has faced criticism at home and abroad. 
Fishing and seafood industry groups in Japan and the wider region have voiced concerns about their livelihoods, as they fear consumers will avoid buying seafood.
And several international experts have shared their concerns over the plans, including one in China who said the IAEA report was ""hasty"", according to China's state-run Global Times newspaper.
More than a million tonnes of treated radioactive water is understood to be stored at the disabled plant in northern Tokyo. The water was used to cool the reactors destroyed by the devastating March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. 
Japan's plan to discharge the water into the ocean was first announced in 2018, where it said the process would be carefully managed and the water would be further diluted by seawater before being released. 
US President Joe Biden is due to meet his South Korean counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol and Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida next week for a trilateral summit, where the controversial plan will be discussed. 
""The governments of South Korea, the US, and Japan should view it an environmental disaster, rather than a political issue, and agree to block it for future generations,"" Ms Choi said.

Niger coup: President Mohamed Bazoum 'in good spirits' despite detention,"Niger's president is in ""good spirits"" despite being held in ""difficult"" conditions by the junta that deposed him, his doctor has said after a visit.
Mohamed Bazoum, his son and wife have been held in the basement of his palace in Niamey since the coup on 26 July.
""Living conditions remain difficult, with the electricity still cut off,"" the doctor was reported as saying by French public radio station RFI.
The visit was approved amid growing international demands for his release.
RFI said it was the first outside contact the president had had since he was overthrown.
Mr Bazoum, 63, is reported to have lost a ""worrying"" amount of weight, while his 20-year-old son, who has a chronic medical condition, was also reportedly denied care.
""The doctor was able to talk to the Head of State, as well as his wife and son,"" RFI reported. ""All are well, he said. The doctor was also able to bring them food and medicines.""
""Following the visit, President Bazoum's family said they were relieved,"" the radio station added.
The decision by the junta, led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani, to bring in the family's doctor appears to be in response to widespread condemnation of the president's detention since the coup.
UN human rights chief Volker Turk described the conditions of the detention as inhumane, degrading and in violation of international human rights law.
His daughter Zazia, 34, who was on holiday in France during the coup, told the Guardian this week that her father, mother and brother had no clean water or electricity and were living on rice and pasta.
Fresh food was rotting in the fridge because there was no power, she said. 
""The situation of my family is very difficult currently,"" she told the newspaper. ""They say they will keep fighting, but it's hard to see our family in this situation and they can't go out.""
The Niger military overthrew the democratically elected president in a coup on 26 July.
It mirrored similar military takeovers in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali, amid an Islamist insurgency and a growing Russian influence in the wider Sahel region through its mercenary group Wagner.
Despite his captivity, Mr Bazoum was able to publish an article in The Washington Post stating that he was a hostage and that the coup would have ""devastating consequences for our country, our region and the entire world"".
More than a week has passed since US President Joe Biden called for Mr Bazoum to be ""immediately released"", and for the ""preservation of Niger's hard-earned democracy"".
That followed the expiration of a deadline by Ecowas, a power bloc of West African states, for the coup leaders to stand down. 
Its threats of military intervention were not followed through, and the junta continues to ignore demands for the president's freedom. 
Ecowas said on Saturday that it hoped to send a committee to Niger to meet coup leaders.

Nigeria mosque collapse: At least seven die in Zaria,"A mosque in the Nigerian city of Zaria has collapsed during prayers, killing at least seven people, officials say. 
Hundreds of worshippers were in the building at the time on Friday. 
An investigation is under way to ascertain the cause of the collapse. The emir of the area told local media a crack had been discovered in one of the walls on Thursday.
The mosque is thought to be more than a century old. Nigeria has a long history of buildings collapsing.
""Four bodies were found initially,"" a council spokesman Abdullahi Kwarbai told Reuters news agency.
""Then three others were found after the rescue team searched the collapsed mosque,"" Mr Kwarbai added.
A team of engineers had been organised to fix the crack in the building, the Emir, Mallam Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli,  told Punch News.

South Africa mass shooting: Manhunt launched in KwaZulu-Natal,"A manhunt has been launched in South Africa after a mass shooting in which six people died, police say.
Four suspects allegedly shot the victims in Umlazi, KwaZulu-Natal, before midnight on Friday, initial information suggests.
One of the suspects believed that one of the victims had his ID, dropped accidentally during a previous murder he was wanted for. 
South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world.
It is thought the suspects shot two people inside the house, a third in a backroom and a fourth next to an outside toilet, a police statement says.
The suspects then allegedly proceeded to shoot three people in a shack nearby.
One of those victims was later rushed to hospital.
Three of the suspects have been identified and police are calling on anyone who might have information on them to come forward.

"Ukraine war: Crimea bridge targeted by missiles, Russia says","Two Ukrainian missiles have targeted a bridge linking Russia to the annexed Crimean peninsula, Moscow says.
Videos on social media show plumes of smoke rising near Kerch bridge. Russia's defence ministry said S-200 missiles had been used and shot down causing no damage.
Ukraine has not commented on the alleged attack.
There have been at least two other attacks targeting the bridge in the past few months.
The Kerch bridge was opened in 2018 and enables road and rail travel between Russia and Crimea - Ukrainian territory annexed by Russia in 2014.
It is an important resupply route for Russian forces occupying parts of southern Ukraine.
Russia's defence ministry said that Ukraine had targeted the structure on Saturday at around 13:00 (10:00 GMT). 
It identified the missiles used as S-200s - guided, Cold War-era surface-to-air weapons originally designed to destroy enemy aircraft that have apparently been adapted for ground-attack use.
The country's foreign ministry meanwhile said that ""such barbaric actions... will not go unanswered"".
Crimea's Russia-appointed governor Sergei Aksyonov later said that a third rocket had been shot down over the Kerch Strait. 
Earlier on Saturday, Russia said it had shot down 20 Ukrainian drones near the peninsula.
An adviser to Mr Aksyonov said that traffic was halted and the smoke was an intentional ""screen"" generated by the military.
While Kyiv has not confirmed the attack, nor the weapons used, it would be the latest in a number of Ukrainian attempts to damage the bridge. 
Last month, the Ukrainian website Euromaidan Press claimed that converted S-200 missiles had been used to attack the bridge as well as two military targets in Russia's Rostov and Bryansk Oblasts.
Also last month, two people died and another was injured when the bridge was struck by explosions. 
Kyiv did not officially confirm it carried out the attack, but a source in its security service told BBC Russian it was behind it and that water-based drones had been used.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said afterwards that the bridge was a legitimate military target that supplied Russia's war effort ""with ammunition on a daily basis"".
""Understandably, this is a target for us. And a target that is bringing war, not peace, has to be neutralised,"" he added.
An explosion on the bridge in October still remains a mystery.
Footage from the time showed a huge fireball erupting as a number of cars and lorries made their way across the bridge. 
The bridge was partially closed and only fully reopened in February. 
Kyiv has repeatedly said it plans to retake Crimea and all territories seized by Russia since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 
An apparent increase in military operations around the bridge comes as Kyiv presses its summer offensive against Russian forces in the Ukraine's east. 
Mr Zelensky has conceded that advances have been ""slower than desired"" as his Western-equipped forces face Russia's well-prepared defensive lines.
Moscow has also blamed Ukraine for a series of drone attacks on Moscow, including strikes on the Kremlin and a tower block housing government ministries. 
While not officially confirming they were Ukrainian operations, Mr Zelensky said that ""gradually, the war is returning to the territory of Russia ... this is an inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process.""
Meanwhile, Russia continues to attack civilian targets in Ukraine, including deadly missile strikes that destroyed a blood transfusion centre in Kharkiv and a residential area in Zaporizhzhia in the last week.

US returns haul of stolen artefacts to Italy,"The United States has returned more than 250 ancient artefacts to Italy after police discovered that they had been stolen.
The art unit of Italy's police force found the items had been looted and sold to US museums and private collectors in the 1990s.
Among the precious artefacts are pots, paintings and sculptures - some up to 3,000 years old.
Several of the mosaics are worth tens of millions of euros.
The oldest item dates back to the Villanovan age (1000 - 750BC), while other artefacts were from the Etruscan civilisation (800 - 200BC), Magna Graecia (750 - 400BC) and Imperial Rome (27BC - 476AD).
Most artefacts had been stolen in the 1990s, then sold through a series of dealers with one selection apparently being offered to the Menil Collection, a museum in Houston, Texas.
The Italian Ministry of Culture said the artefacts were on display in the Menil Collection, but a spokesperson for the museum denied this and said they had never been a part of the collection.
The spokesperson said the museum had been offered the artefacts as a gift, but instead referred the donor to Italy's culture ministry.
The ministry said the owner of the collection ""spontaneously"" returned the items after police found that they had come from illegal excavations of archaeological sites. 
Separately, the ministry said that 145 of the returned artefacts had come from a bankruptcy procedure against an English antiques dealer, Robin Symes, who amassed thousands of pieces as part of a network of illegal traders.
Italy has long sought to track down antiques and artefacts that have been stolen and sold to private collectors and museums.
In September 2022, New York returned $19m (£16m) worth of stolen art to Italy, including a marble head of the goddess Athena dated 200BC, worth an estimated $3m alone.

Islamic State attack on army bus kills 33 Syrian soldiers,"The Islamic State (IS) group has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed at least 33 Syrian soldiers and wounded several others in eastern Syria on Friday. 
The jihadists surrounded a military bus in eastern Deir al-Zour province before opening fire, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
More than 10 other soldiers were injured and dozens are still missing.
The attack has been described as the deadliest this year by IS militants.
Through the extremist group's own news outlet, Amaq, IS said its fighters had carried out an ambush ""on two military buses"", targeting them ""with heavy weapons and rocket-propelled grenades"" and setting one on fire.
The group vowed such attacks will continue. 
Syria's Sana news agency quoted a military source saying that a ""terrorist"" group had attacked a military bus on Thursday in the Steppe desert on the road from the T2 pumping station - which lies close to the Iraqi border south of the city of Deir al-Zour - leaving a number of army personnel dead and injured.
The T2 pumping station was an IS stronghold until its capture by the Syrian army in 2017.
Earlier this week, 10 Syrian soldiers and pro-government fighters were killed in an IS attack in the former jihadist stronghold of Raqqa province, SOHR, a UK-based monitoring group, reported.
Other areas that have similarly come under IS attacks include Raqqa and Hama where activists documented the killing of 43 people, including government forces. 
Since the beginning of August, IS members have increased their attacks in Syria's north and north-east, SOHR said. It added that the region had seen the ""most violent"" escalation in IS activities since it was ""eliminated geographically"".
IS once held 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory, stretching from north-eastern Syria across northern Iraq, and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people.
However it has lost vast swathes of territory since 2019 when the group was driven from its last stronghold.
The UN has warned that IS remains a persistent threat, however. Its militants still ambush and carry out hit-and-run attacks from hideouts in the Syrian desert. 
The former suspected leader of the IS group in Syria, Abu Hussein al-Qurayshi, was killed by Turkish forces in April, the country's president said at the time.
Syria's war broke out after President Bashar al-Assad's government crushed the Arab Spring inspired peaceful protests in 2011. 
More than half a million people have died and the conflict has forced half of the country's pre-war population from their homes.

Maui fire: Death toll climbs to 80,"This video can not be played
Watch: Survivor filmed his escape from Hawaii fires
Eighty people have now been confirmed to have been killed by wildfires on the Hawaiian island of Maui, officials say.
There are fears the numbers will rise further, as hundreds are still uncontactable.
Firefighters have been trying to contain fires in several areas, including the historic town of Lahaina which has been utterly devastated.
Hawaii's attorney general has announced a ""comprehensive review"" into how the authorities responded to the wildfires.
It comes as questions mount over whether officials warned residents fast enough.
State officials reopened Lahaina to people with proof of residency on Friday for the first time since flames swept rapidly through early this week, razing much of the coastal town which has a rich history and attracts some two million tourists a year.
On the Honoapiilani Highway - one of the only available routes into Lahaina - cars sat bumper-to-bumper, with families looking tired and worried alongside trucks piled high with supplies, water, fuel, nappies and toilet paper. 
But within hours after opening, the road was shut to everyone but emergency services.

Watch: Four factors that made Maui wildfires so deadly
Authorities told the BBC that police had been called in to address a ""situation"" but would not elaborate. 
Evacuated Lahaina residents later said they believed their homes had been struck by looting, though this was not confirmed by police. 
Still, for hours after the closure, families sat in a mile-long line. 
Earlier, Governor Josh Green had warned residents would be greeted by ""destruction like they've not ever seen in their lives"".
And for many of Lahaina's evacuees, that waiting devastation is still too much to see. 
In Paukukalo, a coastal neighbourhood east of Lahaina, 23 stranded members of the Tacderan family gathered with relatives to take stock of the loss. 
One of them, 26-year-old Bryan Aguiran, remained in Lahaina through the worst of the fire, fighting the blaze with large buckets of water and miraculously saving his family home.
But he does not want to go back. 
""Every time I close my eyes I see Armageddon,"" he said, adding he has not been able to sleep. 
""Lahaina will never be the same,"" he said. 
He, like many other Maui residents, said he feared how much further the death toll would climb. 
These fears were intensified on Friday evening when residents of Kaanapali - north of Lahaina - were ordered to evacuate as a fire flared up in the area where a fuelling station had been set up. It was brought under control some two hours later, Maui officials said.
West Maui, where Lahaina and Kaanapali are located, is still without power and water. Search crews are still in the area looking for wildfire victims.
That includes in the water. The Coast Guard said it had pulled 17 people alive from the water near the town's harbour so far. All were reported to be in a stable condition.
But Gabe Lucy, who owns a tour operator on Maui, told the BBC that he was hearing horrific accounts. 
""People were jumping in the water and I think for a lot of them the fire wrapped around so quick that the only way to escape was go down to the water's edge,"" said Mr Lucy, whose boats were called in to help.
He added that they were ""picking up four-year-olds and putting them on surfboards and pulling them out"" and that he had heard reports of ""bodies on the rocks"". 
 Authorities have warned it will take many years to repair the damage caused by wildfires on the island of Maui. More than 1,000 buildings have been destroyed in Lahaina alone. 
The extensive damage is an added stress for Maui's locals, many of whom rely on the service jobs supplied by the tourism industry. 
Governor Josh Green warned Hawaiians on Friday what they found in Lahaina would be difficult.
""Lahaina is a devastated zone. They will see destruction like they've not ever seen in their lives,"" said the governor, who visited the town on Thursday. ""Be very safe, be very careful.""
There are six shelters in operation on Maui for those displaced, and officials said they were drafting a plan to house them in hotels and tourist rental properties. 
In recent days, donations have been rolling in.
The island is home to many wealthy people, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. He and his partner Lauren Sanchez have pledged $100m (£79m) to help the fire victims.
Wildfires on Hawaii's Maui island and Big Island began on Tuesday night. The cause is still not known but once lit, hurricane winds and dry weather helped fuel the flames.

Huge cardboard building pops up in Newcastle city centre,"A huge building made entirely from cardboard boxes has popped up in Newcastle city centre.
The structure, which towers above trees and street lights and is 45ft (14m) tall, has been built outside the Civic Centre.
It is an art installation and is part of the Novum Summer Festival, which is making its debut in the city.
Hundreds of volunteers, including children, have helped to make more than 1,500 parts over several days.
Designed by French visual artist Olivier Grossetête, the towering building was erected without any machinery on Friday.
However, it will not last long as it is designed to be toppled by hand on Sunday, when the festival ends.
""When the people are together, it's possible to make beautiful things,"" said Mr Grossetête.
""The finality is not this [the structure], but what is happening around this. It is beautiful to see it [being torn down) too.""
The life-size structure has been designed to mimic a four-storey hall, although Mr Grossetête is known for basing other cardboard structures on real-life buildings.
In recent years he has recreated landmarks including Donnington Castle, while he has been commissioned to recreate a currently unknown Ipswich venue later this year.
Volunteers spent a number of hours piecing the boxes together with brown tape in relatively dry weather, earlier.
Jim Mawdsley, principal advisor, culture and events at Newcastle City Council, said he hoped the creation would kick-start the arrival of similar pieces of art at future festivals.
""As we move forwards, we're going to make it bigger, have different art forms doing big, impressive pieces of dance and music.
""We just want it to become synonymous with Newcastle... this is just the beginning, Novum means new and this is just the beginning"".
Once the structure is destroyed, it is expected the boxes will be recycled.

"Fourteen days across the Atlantic, perched on a ship’s rudder","Four Nigerian stowaways set out for Europe on the rudder of a tanker. They had no idea they were bound for Brazil, and a two-week ocean voyage that would nearly kill them.
A little after midnight on 27 June, Roman Ebimene Friday gathered up the food he had been collecting for a few months and set out in the dark for the large commercial port in the city of Lagos, Nigeria. Earlier that day, Friday had spotted a 620-foot (190m) tanker docked at the port and decided that it would be the ship to deliver him to Europe.
Friday was aiming for the tanker's rudder - the only accessible point on its massive hull for a person who isn't supposed to be aboard. There was no way to bridge the gap from the dock to the rudder, other than convince a fisherman to ferry him across. ""He was a holy man, that fisherman,"" Friday recalled. ""He did not ask for money. He could see that I wanted to leave.""
The fisherman sidled up to the rudder and Friday, 35, pulled himself up, hauling his food bag behind him on a rope. As he steadied himself he saw, to his surprise, three faces in the dark. He was the last of four men with the same idea. ""I was scared, at first,"" Friday said. ""But they were black Africans, my brothers.""
Fearful of being caught, the four men perched silently on the rudder for the next 15 hours. At 5pm, they felt the ship's giant engines shudder to life. Over the din, they shouted a few words. They were all aiming for Europe. They expected to be shipmates for as long as a week. 
The tanker, called the Ken Wave, pushed out from the port and headed to sea - the beginning of a perilous two-week ocean voyage that would bring the stowaways close to death.
As Lagos receded behind them, the men tried and failed to find comfortable positions on the rudder, which moved constantly as it steered the ship. There was precious little space to stand, and the only place to lie was in one of two small nets strung precariously over the water, by previous stowaways, Friday assumed.
It can be hard to understand, from the outside, what drives a person to risk their life on a rudder or a rickety boat across the Mediterranean. But the decision comes easy when you have already lost hope, Friday said. 
""In Nigeria there are no jobs, no money and no way for me to feed my younger brothers and my mother,"" he said. ""I am the first born son and my father died 20 years ago, so I should take care of my family, but I cannot."" 
Instead he had spent three years living on and off the street in Lagos, trying to find work. Each day in Nigeria was a gauntlet of ""crime and sin,"" he said. ""People fighting, killing each other, terrorists attacking, kidnappers. I want a brighter future than that.""
Perched next to Friday on the rudder of the tanker was Thankgod Opemipo Matthew Yeye, a Pentecostal minister, businessman and father of two whose peanut and palm oil farm had washed away in the devastating floods that hit Nigeria last year. There had been no fallback or insurance to cover the loss. 
""My business was destroyed and my family became homeless. And that was the genesis of my decision to leave,"" he said.
Yeye's decision became final after the recent presidential election, which was marred by anomalies and allegations of vote rigging. ""The election had been our hope,"" he said. ""But we know Nigeria well, we know the system is corrupt."" So, without telling his family, he left his sister's home at night and set out for the port, where he knew the Ken Wave was waiting to depart.
Nigeria has seen an exodus of people like Yeye and Friday in recent years, via regular and irregular routes, driven by recessions and record unemployment levels. Many travel across the Sahara and the Mediterranean, where at least 1,200 Nigerians have died already this year, according to the UN.
Some choose to stow away. Last year, three men climbed on a rudder in a similar fashion to Friday and Yeye, and their journey took them 2,500 miles to the Canary islands, an entry point to Spain. Friday and Yeye believed they were following a similar route. 
With their two companions, William and Zeze, they passed the first few days on the ship in a mixture of boredom, discomfort, and fear, talking only a little, praying often and trying to stay awake, as the Ken Wave pushed into the vast stretch of the south Atlantic for the 3,500 mile journey to Brazil.
In some ways, ship stowaways are safer than those who cross parts of the Sahara on foot or the Mediterranean on rickety wooden boats. But as day five passed, Friday and Yeye began to reckon with the specific dangers of their situation. 
They were already weak from rationing their food and tired from lack of sleep. They tied a rope around their waists when they needed to pee off the side of the rudder. When the water was rough, waves lashed them. ""We were all scared of the big waves,"" Yeye said. ""I had never seen the ocean before but I used to watch documentaries about storms and I had seen big ships rocked from side to side by waves."" Sleep was virtually impossible. ""You try not to even close your eyes,"" Friday said. ""The rudder turns 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you have to constantly be alert."" 
The nets came loose and had to be inexpertly refastened. They lay in them again but Friday thought only of being awoken by the sudden feeling of falling and the hit of cold below. ""If the net breaks, you go straight into the water and you are gone,"" he said. And you really were gone. There's no chance of rescue at sea when no-one knows you're lost.
Day passed into night and into day again. The men grew weaker and stopped talking entirely. Friday kept track of the time on his wristwatch. He tried to remember the day. The nets came loose again and were refastened. The food was rationed in smaller parcels, the water in smaller sips. Their mouths began to dry out. Their stomachs ached. They tried to remain vigilant and tried not to fall in.
Day 10 brought the moment the four had been quietly dreading. Some time in the morning, they ate the last of their food and drank the last of their water. All four were already painfully hungry from spacing out the meagre rations they had. ""This was the hardest moment of all,"" Yeye said. ""My mouth was dry and completely cracked. For the first time in my life I really understood the meaning of water."" 
There were a few lighter moments. Yeye told his brothers he was praying for rain and they laughed at him. What are you going to do with rain? they cried. How will you collect it? Rain was only dangerous for them, they chided. The laughter subsided. Hour by hour, they became more thirsty. Time seemed to move more slowly.
The next day, Friday managed to attach a torn cellophane biscuit wrapper to a length of rope and lower it into the ocean, he said, and collect small mouthfuls of salty water for them to drink. They licked toothpaste.
On day 12, sick from salty ocean water, one of the other men began to vomit from the side of the rudder block. ""He was looking straight down into the water and vomiting,"" Friday said. ""He had no strength to hold himself. He was about to fall. I was the only person who had strength left and I had to grab hold of him.""
The men were entering the phase of hunger and thirst that brings you close to death. In an effort to distract himself, Friday began to sit on the edge of the rudder alone, one leg hanging either side, scanning the ocean in vain for anything to interrupt the long unbroken line of the horizon. 
What the ocean gave him, on the 13th day of the voyage, was a whale. 
""The first time in my life I have seen such a thing!"" he said, laughing at the memory. ""If I told anyone at home I had seen a whale they will say I am lying. But I sat on the rudder and I saw a whale. And I forgot I was hungry and thirsty. I watched the whale and it was like watching creation. A holy moment.""
As the first light appeared on the horizon on day 14 of the voyage, Friday was back on the edge of the rudder, staring into the distance, when he felt the ship's mighty engines begin to slow. Then, in the dim light, in the distance, he saw what looked like land. Then buildings. Then a boat.
The Ken Wave was stopping off the coast to take on a fresh crew, and the resupply boat spotted the men. ""Do you know where you are?"" came a shout. Friday tried to shout back that he had no idea, but his throat was too dry. The boat left, then two hours later, in the clearer light, a police dinghy appeared. An officer stretched out a bottle of water to Friday. ""You are in Brazil,"" he said.
Safely back on dry land, the migrants used borrowed phones to call their families. Friday and Yeye's two fellow migrants, William and Zeze, decided to take up an offer of returning directly to Nigeria. Friday and Yeye decided to make Brazil their home. ""We are joyful to be here,"" Yeye said. ""It is a new beginning."" 
They will likely face challenges. Migrants have automatic rights to healthcare and other benefits in Brazil, but African migrants often face racism and struggle to find well-paid work. Friday and Yeye have been taken in by a shelter in São Paulo and are being assisted by a Catholic mission, Missao Paz, with Portuguese lessons and other support. Yeye wants to start a new business and bring his wife and children over. 
Friday is focused on the more immediate future. ""I am in a new place, I am trying to adapt, I am trying to learn the language,"" he said. The first journey he had ever made out of Nigeria had nearly killed him, but as the days passed after his rescue, he felt the hopelessness that had dogged him back home begin to ebb, he said.

Judge Chutkan warns Trump against 'inflammatory' remarks before trial,"A federal judge has warned former US President Donald Trump against making ""inflammatory"" statements which could taint the jury pool ahead of his trial for conspiring to overturn the result of the 2020 election. 
But Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled that Mr Trump can publicly share some of the non-sensitive evidence which prosecutors disclose to his legal team.
Friday's ruling was a blow to the special counsel who had expressed concern Mr Trump might reveal secret material and intimidate witnesses. 
At a 90-minute hearing in Washington DC, the judge said the historic case was proceeding as normal. 
""He is a criminal defendant. He is going to have restrictions like every single other defendant,"" she said. 
""The fact that the defendant is engaged in a political campaign is not going to allow him any greater or lesser latitude than any defendant in a criminal case.""  
What Mr Trump can reveal publicly is one of several battles being fought between the former president's legal team and federal prosecutors.
Requests for protective orders are fairly routine in criminal cases. In many cases, defence teams are reluctant to oppose the orders because doing so would slow down ""discovery"" - the process in which prosecutors hand over evidence. 
In this case, however, Mr Trump and his lawyers argued that his free speech was being stifled and argued that only sensitive information should be kept under wraps. 
Judge Chutkan agreed. However, she said that his First Amendment rights was ""not absolute"" amid the ongoing case - and warned that she would not allow a ""carnival atmosphere"" at his eventual trial.
The former president is already subject to a protective order in a separate upcoming New York case about alleged hush money payments to former adult film actress Stormy Daniels. 
His legal team also agreed to similar conditions in another case related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents.
 ""The thing that's different about the Florida case is that the documents themselves are confidential,"" said Kevin McMunigal, a former federal prosecutor and law professor at Case Western Reserve University. 
""And there, a lot of the witnesses are going to be FBI agents who went in and seized the documents. They aren't going to be intimidated.""
The protective order is far from the only point of contention for Mr Trump in his Washington DC case. He has also argued that he cannot expect a fair trial in the US capital because the city's electorate votes overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates.
His lawyer, John Lauro, has suggested nearby West Virginia as an alternative.  
Any venue change, however, is extremely unlikely.
More than three dozen participants in the 6 January, 2021, riot at the US Capitol have already sought to have their trials moved out of the city, only to be rejected - sometimes by Trump-appointed judges.
In a July filing, prosecutors argued ""the fact that most [DC] residents voted against Donald Trump does not mean those residents could not impartially consider the evidence"" in the case. 
The fact the courts in DC have handled a lot of cases related to the riot creates ""a lot of precedent"" that would work against Mr Trump's request to change venues, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia. 
""Many other judges on the same court have already said that [DC] is large and diverse enough that the presumption that you can't sit 12 impartial jurors is far-fetched,"" he added.
Following Mr Trump's initial arraignment on 3 August in the election fraud case , he also took aim at Judge Chutkan, arguing that ""there is no way"" that he can get a fair trial with her assigned to the case.
He vowed that his legal team would ask that Ms Chutkan recuse herself on what he termed ""very powerful grounds"". They have yet to do so. 
The 61-year-old judge has earned a reputation for strictly punishing defendants accused of participating in the Capitol riot.
Mr Tobias explained that in the US federal court systems, judges can and should be recused if they have a conflict of interest or ""an appearance of unfairness"" that would hinder their ability to oversee a case.
""But [Judge Chutkan] has given no indication of that,"" he said.
 ""I think she will stay on the case,"" he added. ""[Trump] won't win on that point.""

"China floods: The families torn apart by 'huge, furious waves'","Ten-year-old Miao Chunyou screamed for her mum as she disappeared into a brown torrent that had engulfed western Beijing.
The strong currents ripped Miao from her father's grip as floods, triggered by incessant rains, chased the family of three to the roof of a neighbour's house.
Her mother, clinging to a tree branch, watched helplessly. That was the last time she saw Miao. More than 10 days have passed but the couple has heard no news about their daughter. 
""It was like a scene from a movie, with huge, furious waves,"" Miao's mother tells the BBC. She only shared her last name, Chang. 
China is no stranger to floods, but July saw a trio of typhoons from the Pacific Ocean over three weeks, which exacerbated seasonal monsoon rains. Two of the three made landfall in the country, including super typhoon Doksuri, which churned slowly over large areas of north-west China for several days, inundating Beijing and surrounding provinces such as Hebei. That week, the Chinese capital experienced the most rainfall in 140 years.
Sixty-two people have so far been confirmed dead in the deluge - 33 from Beijing and 29 from neighbouring Hebei province.
Miao was swallowed by water ""as high as two adults, one standing on the other"", her mother says. ""Villagers in their 70s or 80s said they had never seen floods this big in their lives.""
She says that it had been raining heavily until July 30, when the downpour eased. The family believed the worst had passed, but stayed home, worried that going outside could expose them to mudslides.
But the following morning ""the rain came down heavily"", Ms Chang said. As water rapidly filled the house, she and her husband tried to pump it out. But within half hour, flood water and mud smashed through the front wall.
Mr Chang is a migrant worker and spends much of the year in Beijing, where he sells spices. His wife and daughter were visiting him from Henan when the rains began. The three had mostly been apart during years of zero-Covid rules, and this was had been a much-awaited reunion. They had planned to visit Tiananmen square the day they lost Miao to the flood. 
Ms Chang and her husband adopted Miao as a baby. They have two older sons, 27-year-old twins, who were back home in Henan province in central China when the flood hit. Distraught at what happened to their sister, one of them is unable to even speak, Ms Chang says.
China's flood control system allows for water to be diverted from major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin to surrounding areas. During the floods, Hebei's Party Secretary Ni Yuefeng proudly declared that his province would act as a ""moat"" to protect Beijing, stirring anger among his constituents, who said the speed with which the flood waters hit caught them by surprise.
Wan, who wished to reveal only his last name, lives in Beijing but was alerted to a distress message on WeChat on 2 August. The mountain village of Tangjiazhuang in Hebei province, where his family lives, was hit by a landslide two days earlier.
It had cut off the village of 2,000 mostly elderly people. Some families had gathered there for the cool highland weather because parts of China had sweltered in heat waves before the typhoons brought deadly rains.
Mr Wan says he rushed to Tangjiazhuang with his wife to rescue their relatives. But they were stopped at a neighbouring village by neck-deep water. Undeterred, they took an alternate route that involved a an uphill three-hour hike. The terrain caused him to slip and twist his ankle.
""When we finally got there, all we saw was an ocean, with nothing left,"" Mr Wan's wife recalls.
Rescuers reached Tangjiazhuang on 3 August, three days after the landslide, and a day after the Wan couple found the village where their family had been in ruins. Local authorities counted 10 people dead and 18 others missing. Mr Wan, citing anecdotal reports, says the death toll is likely higher than official tallies. 
Mr Wan says seven of his relatives are either dead or missing, including his two nephews, aged seven and four. He reads out their names: ""Wan Hanying, my second uncle, Li Shulan, my second aunt, Wan Hechun, my third uncle, Jing Zhizhen, my third aunt, Wan Gongle, my sister, her children, Li Jiaqi and Li Jiaxin.""
China's state-run media, which has released death tolls outside Beijing over several days, has focused on the rescue efforts, with headlines such as: ""There is a sense of security called the People's Liberation Army"" and ""Shandong rescue team work in floods, starving, with hands shaking uncontrollably from the cold"". 
But that did not stop those on social media form noticing that President Xi Jinping did not visit any of the sites where disaster struck, unlike his predecessors. He did call for an ""all-out"" flood rescue effort, a message that was carried prominently on state media.
Instead on 31 July, as parts of north-east China were submerged, and Miao was swept away, Mr Xi attended a ceremony in Beijing to promote generals in the Central Military Commission.
Mr Xi could be asserting his status as a princeling, or someone born to a Communist Party official, says Dr Ming Xia, a professor of political science and global affairs at the City University of New York.
""He draws more legitimacy from the revolutionary tradition and does not urgently seek to derive some legitimacy from public opinion, as his predecessors Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, who were born into ordinary families, did."" 
As the floods receded, people have begun piecing their lives back together, shovelling mud out of their homes, and washing clothes and appliances that have turned brown. But scientists say climate change will spawn stronger, more frequent typhoons like Doksuri.
For Mr Wan, it is all too much. ""The mountain still has fissures and future dangers are certain,"" he says. ""We definitely won't live there anymore.""

Niger coup: Fear and anger in Niamey as Ecowas threatens force,"Zara Kada serves up dishes of rice, fish and vegetables in plastic bowls to her customers sitting on wooden benches in the capital of Niger's capital, Niamey. This business is a lifeline for the widowed mother-of-seven but it's under threat as food prices have shot up after economic sanctions were imposed after the military seized power. 
""Not only has the price of rice increased but also that of cooking oil. It's an increase of 2,500F CFA ($4: £3) in just one week,"" she says standing by her small food stall. ""This causes us problems because if I prepare the rice and I can't sell it, there will be no profits, only losses.""
Two weeks ago, Niger's army deposed the country's democratically elected President, Mohamed Bazoum, attracting widespread international condemnation. 
The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) is determined to stop yet another military takeover in the region - the sixth in just three years. 
""We are drawing the line in the sand,"" Ecowas security chief Abdel Fatau Musah tells the BBC.
""There is a contagion and if we do not determinedly stop what has happened there, then which country is next?"" he asks.
So Ecowas has reacted quickly, by cutting off financial transactions, electricity supplies and, in a move particularly painful for landlocked Niger, closed its land borders, blocking crucial imports.  
Now, after a second emergency summit on the crisis in Niger, regional heads of state have ordered the activation of a standby military force, ready to invade the country should the military continue their hold on power. 
On the streets of Niamey, there is real anger at the way regional governments have reacted and the threat of military intervention. 
""The Niger soldiers are ready to face any aggression against our country of any kind. They should count on our support, the support of the population and its partners. We are ready,"" says Bana Ibrahim.
The 46-year-old is one of the leaders of a so-called self-defence unit that has been set up in response to the Ecowas announcement.
Another member of the unit, Moudi Moussa, agrees: ""We are here to defend our country because the country is threatened by Ecowas mercenaries. I call them mercenaries in the pay of [French President Emmanuel] Macron. So we are here to protect our Niger and the people of Niger.""
While businesses like Ms Kada's have taken a hit since the coup, Ibrahim Souleymane's is picking up. 
In his crammed tailor's shop, he picks out white, blue and red pieces of cloth - the colours of the Russian tricolour.
""It was with the advent of the [General] Tchiani coup that I started sewing flags. Especially for Russia. People come to buy a lot of it because they use it to support our soldiers who have taken power,"" he says. 
Even though the flags of France, Niger's former colonial ruler, and Russia have the same colours, some people's feelings towards the two European powers couldn't be more different.
""People buy it [Russian flag] because we are in conflict with France. For years, France has only caused us problems and the military wants to put an end to it,"" Mr Souleymane adds. 
The coup has unleashed widespread anti-French sentiment in the country. Paris is accused of continuing to wield undue influence in Niger long after independence and unfairly benefiting from its natural resources while most people live below the poverty line. 
Moscow has built close ties with neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso - two other former French colonies which have seen recent military takeovers. Its propaganda networks promote Russia as a better ally for African countries. 
France has lost public goodwill in many Francophone countries and it's now backing the unpopular intervention by Ecowas in Niger. 
In a statement, the government in Paris said it ""affirms its full support for all the conclusions"" of this week's summit.
On social media networks, regional heads of state are facing accusations of working in the interests of Western powers - Mr Bazoum was a close ally of both the US and France and allowed them to have military bases in the country to help fight Islamist insurgents who are targeting the entire Sahel region of West Africa. 
But how likely is it that Ecowas will carry out its threat to use force? 
""They still say it's on the table, but I think it's up for negation,"" argues Marie-Roger Biloa, a West Africa analyst. 
""The military option will prove to be very delicate, and there are many voices against it. Even former prime ministers, former dignitaries of Niger are saying: 'Please, please don't launch a military attack against our country. That will be terrible for the population.'""
However Ms Biloa believes regional leaders will have to find a solution otherwise there could be more coups on the continent, especially where military elites can capitalise on the weaknesses of civilian authorities to seize power. 
""African governments are having a hard time trying to deliver on the needs of the people,"" she says.
""You have a huge population, which is very young, jobless, and they are not sure of the future. In this political context, you can always find people who support you when you overthrow the incumbent."" 
Back at her food stall in Niamey, Ms Kada is worried an Ecowas invasion could open a deadly pandora's box for her country. 
""Conflicts like this one, we just know how it starts but the end, we don't know.""

Ukraine war: Sex lives in focus for Ukraine's injured veterans,"At a modern office in central Kyiv, a 26-year-old Ukrainian veteran is proudly playing a video on his phone that shows him passionately kissing a young woman in a kitchen.
It is an advert for ReSex: a charity that tries to help former soldiers with their sex lives, after suffering physical and mental trauma. 
In March last year, invading Russian forces launched a brutal siege of the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, pounding much of it to ruins. Hlib Stryzhko - then a marine - was one of the city's defenders. 
A Russian blast knocked him from the third floor of a building to the ground. He was then crushed under rubble. 
Hlib's pelvis, jaw and nose were broken, and as well as being badly concussed, he says the heat of the explosion melted his tactical goggles onto his face. He was then captured by Russian forces and taken as a prisoner of war. 
The following month, Hlib was released and sent back to Ukrainian territory as part of a prisoner exchange. But he says he received little medical care during his time in captivity. 
The BBC first spoke to Hlib just weeks after his release, and later spoke to him during his rehabilitation.
It was while Hlib worked on his recovery that ReSex approached him. 
""After my pelvis injury I had problems that took some time to heal. And [the issue of sex] wasn't talked much about, so I wouldn't want that to happen to other people like me,"" he says. 
""That was a motivation to take part in the project.""
Ivona Kostyna is one of the founders of Veteran Hub, the group which runs the ReSex project.
She says they first had the idea for the project back in 2018, after reading about the issue for US soldiers.
After securing funding with the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, they spoke to Ukrainian soldiers and experts, to ensure they were tailoring their help specifically to the men and women who need it.
They faced some confusion from the public - and veterans - when they first asked for responses to questions online. ""People are dying, you're thinking about sex!"" Ivona says. 
They also had to confront some of their own preconceptions - like the false assumption that injured veterans would all be struggling with their sex lives. 
""There's sex in the hospital, sex at home, sex before procedures, sex after. There's a lot of good sex going on,"" Ivona says. ""We were like, wow, OK, how can we be helpful here?"".
But overall, she says, the response has been overwhelmingly positive.
The charity has printed some 6,000 booklets and sent them out to medical centres, veterans and their families all around Ukraine, and made them available online.
ReSex has also launched a social media campaign with videos, graphics and a helpline. The charity covers everything from masturbation to sex toys and even basic biology. 
""We try to cover it all,"" Ivona says, adding that there's also a section of the booklet specifically for young injured veterans who may be virgins. 
""So sex after their wound would be their first sex ever, which is quite different from what they might have imagined.""
Kateryna Skorokhod, ReSex's project manager, says they published separate guides for women and men to ensure respective partners have specific advice tailored to their experiences and their bodies. 
She stresses, though, that the focus of the project is more on the emotional side than the physical. 
""It's about how you can accept yourself, how you can love yourself, and how you can build a relationship with yourself and your partner after these injuries - with sex and with intimacy in relationships.""
Relying on veterans answering their questionnaire means there are gaps in their research, she says, adding that they've struggled to get any responses from the LGBTQ community. 
But they've also learnt a great deal about Ukraine's veterans. Specifically, they realised that traumatic brain injuries are often going undiagnosed and under treated in the country - something she says affects ""the libido and the whole sexual performance very much"". 
The language used to discuss sex is important too, Ivona says. 
""It's definitely not a dramatic language. It's definitely not about 'overcoming obstacles' - that's probably good for sport, but it turns out sex is not on the same scale."" 
She says it's important to make sure veterans know they don't have to have sex unless they want to, and that sex may be difficult or painful at first.
Hlib certainly speaks positively about the project that he's joined. When asked if he's had a girlfriend since his injuries, he laughs.
""After I came back from captivity and the hospital, I had a girlfriend, and then another when I was doing the project questionnaire. And now I have a partner,"" he says. ""I might have missed one.""
But he said he was thankful for every person he had dated in the past year. 
""Every partner I had was important to me, in gaining my confidence back. I'm very grateful for that.""

Yemen: Oil salvaged from abandoned 'time bomb' tanker in Red Sea,"A ""floating time bomb"" oil tanker left adrift in the Red Sea has successfully been drained of its cargo, the UN says.
The vessel was abandoned off Yemen in 2015 after war broke out with more than one million barrels of oil on board.
It was feared the deteriorating FSO Safer could explode or break apart, causing a major spill.
The UN said environmental disaster had been averted but it is unclear how the oil's sale will be agreed between warring sides.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the international community had ""defused a floating time bomb and prevented a potentially enormous environmental and health disaster"".
The UN led a $120m (£95m) fundraising effort to secure the decaying ship and buy another tanker to take the recovered oil.
It took 18 days to complete the transfer in a stretch of water where naval mines were known to be located.
The FSO Safer was constructed in 1976 and was carrying more oil than was spilled in the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster when it was left at sea.
It is anchored near the Ras Isa oil terminal, which is controlled by Yemen's rebel Houthi movement.
The group is still fighting a Saudi-led coalition in a conflict that has devastated much of the country.
Work is set to begin on the difficult task of decontaminating and scrapping the vessel but the fate of the recovered oil - which is majority owned by Yemeni state firm SEPOC - may prove even more complex to resolve.
There is no agreement on how profits from the oil's sale will be shared among warring groups.
UN development programme administrator Achim Steiner said: ""The best end to the story will be when that oil actually is sold and leaves the region altogether.""

Special counsel to investigate President Biden's son Hunter,"This video can not be played
Watch: US announces special counsel for Hunter Biden investigation.
Joe Biden's son Hunter will now be investigated by a special counsel with additional powers, the US attorney general has announced.
Merrick Garland has elevated the status of David Weiss, the federal prosecutor who has already filed criminal charges in the case.
A plea deal on tax and gun charges against the president's son collapsed earlier this month. 
Republicans are pushing for an inquiry into Hunter Biden's business dealings.
In a surprise announcement at the Department of Justice on Friday, Mr Garland explained that he was making the move after a request by Mr Weiss earlier this week.
The new designation will provide the prosecutor with extra resources to pursue the investigation and to potentially bring further charges beyond the state of Delaware.  
Mr Garland said the special counsel would produce a report when his work was done, and that the justice department would make as much of it public as was possible.
""The appointment of Mr Weiss reinforces for the American people the department's commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters,"" Mr Garland said at a news conference. 
Hunter Biden's lawyer, Chris Clark, responded in a statement: ""We are confident when all of these manoeuvrings are at an end my client will have resolution and will be moving on with his life successfully."" 
Mr Clark pointed out that the investigation has already gone on for five years. 
Mr Weiss was appointed by former President Donald Trump to become the US attorney in Delaware in 2018. Not long after, in 2019, he opened an investigation into allegations of criminal conduct by Hunter Biden. 
Hunter Biden has since been charged with two misdemeanour tax offenses for allegedly not paying income taxes in 2017 and 2018, years in which he earned in excess of $1.5m (£1.1m), according to the US Attorney's Office in Delaware. 
He faces an additional felony charge for allegedly possessing a firearm while addicted to and using illegal drugs. 
Hunter Biden had previously reached a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to the tax charges and admit the gun offence to spare himself prison time.
However, US District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika squashed the deal due to ""non standard terms"" and the ""unusual"" nature of the proposed resolution for the gun charge. 
Since then, Hunter Biden and prosecutors have engaged in further plea negotiations but remain at an impasse. In a court filing on Friday, Mr Weiss's team said they now expect the case to go to trial - and could potentially file new, more serious charges in Washington DC or California.
Republicans want to see the younger Mr Biden further criminally charged, along with the president. They allege that Mr Biden has profited from his son's business dealings in Ukraine and China. 
House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that the Republican-controlled chamber will continue to investigate the president and his son regardless of the special counsel announcement. 
He echoed concern expressed by other Republicans that Mr Weiss's inquiry has been insufficiently aggressive.
Other Republicans have wondered whether the attempt to move the trial out of Delaware, where it had been overseen by Trump-appointed Ms Noreika, was an attempt to find a legal venue more friendly to the Bidens.
The White House called the allegations ""insane conspiracy theories"" and rejected the assertion that Mr Biden has participated in his son's business affairs. 
Mr Weiss has conducted a years-long investigation into the matter. So far, he has not found any evidence that Hunter Biden's business dealings have benefited from his father's presidential status.  
The special counsel announcement - and the possibility of new charges leading to a jury trial - all but assures that the investigation into Hunter Biden will stretch on well into the 2024 presidential election season, if not past election day itself. It will continue to be a distraction for White House officials who had until recently hoped that the issue was approaching a resolution. 
But Friday's announcement may also diffuse some of the conservative claims that there are two standards of justice in the US - one for Republicans and one for the Bidens.

Italy could host Musk v Zuckerberg cage fight,"A planned cage fight between tech leaders Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg could now take place in Italy, and have an ancient Rome theme.
In the story's latest twist, Italy's culture minister on Friday said that he had spoken to Mr Musk about hosting the showdown as a charity event.
The billionaire CEOs of Tesla and Meta (formerly Facebook) have been goading each other into the fight since June.
If it goes ahead, millions are expected to be donated to children's hospitals.
However, Mr Zuckerberg has said no date has been agreed so far.
Detailing his vision on social media platform X (previously known as Twitter), Mr Musk said he had spoken to both Italy's prime minister and its culture minister.
""They have agreed on an epic location,"" he wrote. ""Everything in camera frame will be ancient Rome, so nothing modern at all.""
However the capital Rome, and its iconic Colosseum - where legendary Gladiator fights were held in ancient times - have been ruled out.
Italy's Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said in a statement that the ""great charity"" event would resonate with the country's historical significance while also preserving its cultural heritage.
""I had a long and friendly conversation with Elon Musk, we talked about our shared passion for ancient Roman history,"" Mr Sangiuliano said in a statement.
""We are thinking about how to organise a great charity and historical evocation event, respecting, and fully protecting the setting... It will not take place in Rome.""
Mr Sangiuliano also said that a ""substantial amount, many millions of euros"" is expected to be donated to two Italian children's hospitals as a result of hosting the cage match.
Writing on Threads, the platform seen as a direct competitor to X, which he launched last month, Mark Zuckerberg said he has ""been ready to fight since the day Elon challenged me"", and if a date was ever agreed, ""you'll hear it from me"". 
""Until then, please assume anything he says has not been agreed on."" 
Seeming to take a dig at the floated plans, Mr Zuckerberg said that when he competes, he wants ""to do it in a way that puts a spotlight on the elite athletes at the top of the game"". 
""You do that by working with professional (organisations) like the UFC or ONE [mixed martial arts organisations] to pull this off well and create a great card,"" he said.  
Elon Musk, 52, and Mark Zuckerberg, 39 are two of the world's most high-profile technology billionaires.
The bizarre idea to fight each other started in June, when Mr Musk tweeted that he was ""up for a cage fight"" with Mr Zuckerberg.
The Meta CEO, who already has mixed martial arts (MMA) training and has recently won jiu-jitsu tournaments, simply responded with ""send me location"".

"O'Shae Sibley: Suspect, 17, pleads not guilty to hate crime","The 17-year-old suspect accused of fatally stabbing a gay man in New York has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder as a hate crime.
O'Shae Sibley and his friends had been voguing at a petrol pump in Brooklyn on 29 July when an argument broke out with a group of teenagers.
Prosecutors claim the teens hurled homophobic and racist slurs before the suspect stabbed Mr Sibley in the chest.
Charged as an adult, the attacker faces 20 years to life in prison.
At his initial court appearance on Friday, he was identified as Dmitriy Popov, a final-year student at a local secondary school.
""Nothing about his past or his history shows that he's the type of person to commit this crime,"" his lawyer Mark Pollard told reporters.
Denying that his client had used any slurs, he hinted that his client may argue he acted in self-defence. 
Prosecutors intend to prove the suspect's ""senseless"" and ""targeted"" actions were fuelled by anti-black and anti-LGBT bias.
""We're going to stand up for Mr Sibley, for the right he had to dance and be exuberant, the right he had not to stop dancing because it offended someone else,"" Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said at a Thursday news conference.
""Hate crimes impact a victim, but it also impacts a community. It robs not just the family, but an entire community of their sense of safety and security.""
Mr Sibley, a professional dancer and choreographer, and his friends were returning from a day at the beach when they stopped at a petrol pump in the Midwood section of Brooklyn.
While at the filling station, they were voguing - a dance form associated with creative expression and resistance in LGBT circles - to the tune of songs from Renaissance, a Beyoncé album that is considered a love letter to black queer dance culture.
Surveillance footage shows the two groups walking away from a heated dispute before Mr Sibley returns to confront the 17-year-old with his phone, then lunges at him.
Prosecutors say the teen stabbed Mr Sibley out of view of cameras, adding that they do not believe Mr Sibley's conduct was ""cause for someone to take a weapon and do what was done in this case"".
Protests and vigils replete with voguing have been held in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere over a murder that has struck a chord within the LGBT community.
Some 200 mourners paid tribute to Mr Sibley at his funeral Tuesday, held in a historic opera house in his hometown of Philadelphia.
""O'Shae had the power to touch everyone's heart, whoever met him,"" Otis Pena, a close friend who was at the petrol station, said. ""O'Shae was a beacon of light for a lot of us in our community.""
Others celebrated Mr Sibley's journey in dance since the age of three, from performing with the Philadelphia Dance Company to teaching at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.
The dance company said it had established a scholarship in his honour ""to encourage other students like him to follow their dreams"".

Niger coup: Russia warns Ecowas not to take military action,"Russia has warned that military intervention in Niger would lead to a ""protracted confrontation"" after regional bloc Ecowas said it would assemble a standby force.
Such an intervention would destabilise the Sahel region as a whole, the Russian foreign ministry said.
Russia does not formally back the coup.
But the US, which backs efforts to restore deposed leader Mohamed Bazoum, says its Wagner mercenary group is taking advantage of the instability.
On Friday coup supporters, some waving Russian flags, protested at a French military base near the capital NIamey, some chanting ""down with France, down with Ecowas"".
Both France and the US operate military bases in Niger and they have been used to launch operations against jihadist groups in the wider region.
Military officials from Ecowas countries are reportedly set to meet on Saturday to draft plans for a military intervention.
The bloc has said it remains open to finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu said on Thursday that ""No option is taken off the table, including the use of force as a last resort"".
The US has not explicitly backed military action but has called on the junta to step aside and allow the restoration of the country's democratic constitution. 
The Niger junta has not responded to the latest statements from Ecowas leaders.
Meanwhile fears are growing for the health and safety of Mr Bazoum, who has been held captive since the military seized power on 26 July.
He and his family had been ""deprived of food, electricity and medical care for several days"", EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.
UN rights commissioner Volker Turk said he had received credible reports that the conditions of detention ""could amount to inhuman and degrading treatment"".
Rights group Human Rights Watch said Mr Bazoum had told them this week that he and his family were being treated in an ""inhuman and cruel"" way.
""My son is sick, has a serious heart condition, and needs to see a doctor,"" HRW quoted Mr Bazoum as telling them.

Lost homes and missing loved ones after Maui wildfires,"A long line of at least 100 cars stretched towards Maui's War Memorial Stadium on Thursday, even as the shelter began reaching capacity. 
Scores of evacuees have arrived here and set up camp after wildfires tore through the Hawaiian island, destroying entire neighbourhoods and leaving many residents with nowhere to stay.
Volunteers have been trying to create a comfortable atmosphere despite the heat, offering local treats like shaved ice. But conditions are still challenging.
People have to bring their own bedding to the shelter, so many are sleeping on bare cots and air mattresses. And after seeing what people were in need of, part-time Maui resident and talk show host Oprah Winfrey, brought pillows and other goods. 
Tom Leonard has lived in Lahaina for 44 years. He told the BBC he has been staying at the shelter for the past two days after losing all of his possessions. He has no idea where he will go next. 
More concerning than the loss of possessions, are the loved ones that people have yet to hear back from. There is even a sense of guilt for some people here.
Hundreds are said to be missing. At least 55 people have died and that number is expected to rise. 
Getting in contact with loved ones has been made even more challenging by the fact mobile service on the island has been unreliable.
People are doing what they can at the shelter, writing down the names of their loved ones along with their contact information and sticking notes on increasingly crowded whiteboards. 
Maui resident Ellie Erickson created a Google spreadsheet to crowdsource efforts to find people. Although she only shared it on Wednesday morning, thousands of names have already been added to the list. Some are marked in green as ""found"" and other names are marked in red as ""not located"". 
With the names of the dead not yet confirmed, people have only rumours to go on to know whether their neighbours and friends are still alive.
Chelsey Vierra's great-grandmother, Louise Abihai, lives at the Hale Mahaolu senior living facility. She told the Associated Press that she did not know if she was OK. 
""She doesn't have a phone. She's 97 years old,"" Ms Vierra said. ""She can walk. She is strong.""
""If you never made contact with your family before sunset last night, you're still trying to figure out where they are,"" Leomana Turalde, 36, told USA Today. He has several aunties who live near Lahaina's popular Front Street which bore some of the heaviest.
One of them went missing on Wednesday morning. 
At the shelter, Les Munn, 42, recalled packing his belongings as the hurricane winds began coming to shore. His building then caught fire around him. ""Everything went black"", he said, as the smoke began pouring in.
""I ran up, knocking on some of my neighbours doors. And some of them wouldn't come out,"" he said, sounding perplexed by their decision.
Eventually he ran outside, spotted a blue light from a police car through the dense black smoke, and ran and dove into the back of the vehicle. ""And that's how I survived,"" he said from his shelter cot.
He added that he had not seen any of his neighbours in the shelter and was concerned for their safety. 
""I don't know their fate,"" he said. ""I don't know if they survived.""

Ukraine fires military conscription officials for taking bribes,"Ukrainian conscription officials accused of taking bribes and smuggling people out of the country have been sacked in an anti-corruption purge.
Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed that more than 30 people face criminal charges, with all regional officials in charge of military conscription removed.
He said bribery at a time of war is ""high treason"". 
It comes amid efforts to bolster the armed forces, as Ukraine's counter-offensive operation continues.
A statement from the president's office said corruption allegations ""pose a threat to Ukraine's national security and undermine confidence in state institutions"".
Replacement officials will be chosen from candidates who have battlefield experience and have been vetted by the intelligence service, it continued.
Officials taking cash and cryptocurrency bribes or helping people eligible to be called up to fight to leave Ukraine are among the charges, said Mr Zelensky, in a video posted on social media. 
Ukraine's general mobilisation rules mean all men over the age of 18 capable of fighting are eligible to be conscripted, and most adult men under the age of 60 are prohibited from leaving the country.
""We are dismissing all regional military commissars,"" he said. 
""This system should be run by people who know exactly what war is and why cynicism and bribery at a time of war is high treason.""
He said the conscription system ""is not working decently"", adding: ""The way they treat warriors, the way they treat their duties, it's just immoral.""
The corruption came to light after an inspection of local army offices.
Mr Zelensky said 112 criminal proceedings against 33 suspects have been launched against regional officials, and that abuses had been found across the country.
Neither Ukraine or Russia reveal how many of their soldiers have been killed since the February 2022 invasion, but both have sought recruits widely as attritional fighting continues.
The anti-corruption drive is the latest to be launched by the Zelensky government.
In January 11 officials accused of corruption left their posts and the head of the country's Supreme Court was detained in May over bribery allegations.
Corruption in public services has been a long-running problem in Ukraine and tackling it is one of the tests the country would have to pass to join Western institutions like the European Union.
According to Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranks 116th out of 180 countries, but efforts in recent years have seen its position improve significantly.

Niger coup: Ecowas to deploy standby force,"West African nations have approved armed intervention in Niger ""as soon as possible"", the Ivory Coast president says, following a meeting to discuss the coup.
At the meeting, leaders of the Ecowas regional bloc said they had agreed to deploy a ""standby"" military force.
However, they have not given any details of the size of the force.
Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu said the use of force would be a ""last resort"".
A military junta seized power in Niger on July 26.
After the Ecowas meeting in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, Ivory Coast's Alassane Ouattara said Ecowas had intervened in African countries in order to restore constitutional order before.
""Today we have a similar situation in Niger, and I like to say that Ecowas cannot accept this,"" he said.
Mr Ouattara said the Ivory Coast would provide a battalion of 850 to 1,100 men, and said soldiers from Nigeria and Benin would also be deployed.
The overall size of the force and how many troops each country is expected to contribute not known now but a presidential source in Abuja told the BBC that Ecowas would want to engage in a ""show of force"" to convince the Niger coup leaders that it's ready to follow through its threat. 
""The ultimate goal is to try to bring General Abdourahmane Tchiani to the dialogue table,"" he said. 
Speaking to journalists at the end of Thursday's meeting, former Nigerian military leader General Abdulsalami Abubakar, who led a delegation to Niger over a week ago but did not get to see the coup leader, said: ""Nobody wants to go to war. We want peace. All options are on the table."" 
Omar Touray, president of the Ecowas group, said members had decided ""to order the deployment of the Ecowas standby force to restore constitutional order in Niger"".
He did not set out further details of what the force it intends to assemble might look like or what action it might take.
Abdel Musah, the bloc's security commissioner, told the BBC that Ecowas would not allow the junta to stay in power during a transitional period like their counterparts in Burkina Faso and Mali.
However, he said the junta was not willing to have direct contact with Ecowas, making negotiations difficult.
The US and UN say they are concerned about the health and safety of deposed president Mohamed Bazoum, who has spent more than two weeks under house arrest.
Ahead of Thursday's meeting, Muslim clerics from northern Nigeria, which shares a long border with Niger, had urged Nigerian President Tinubu against using force to oust the coup leaders.
But speaking after the meeting, he said: ""No option is taken off the table, including the use of force as a last resort.
""If we don't do it, no one else will do it for us.""
The coup leaders have warned they will defend themselves against any intervention.
Ecowas had issued a deadline of last Sunday to the Niger junta to restore the democratically-elected government, but it was ignored.
Instead, military leaders named a new ruling cabinet.
Both the US and France have military bases in Niger, which have been used as part of efforts to tackle jihadist groups in the wider Sahel region.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the the BBC earlier this week that he believes Russia's Wagner mercenary group is ""taking advantage"" of the instability in Niger.

South Africa's ex-President Jacob Zuma won't return to prison due to overcrowding,"South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has been spared from returning to prison, with officials saying this is to ease overcrowding.
Zuma, who was sentenced to 15 months for contempt of court, surrendered himself to the authorities on Friday.
The 81-year-old had previously been freed on medical parole - in a move ruled illegal by the courts.
Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said he had been given remission to address overcrowding in prisons. 
Zuma is one of more than 9,000 low-risk prisoners released under a scheme which began in April to make space in South Africa's jails, official say.
Mr Lamola said the decision had been taken by the prison authorities without any political interference, and that Zuma had not been given any special treatment.
The remission process aims to alleviate strain on the system by releasing low-risk offenders.
A prisons department spokesperson told the BBC that South Africa's prison population was currently 47% higher than official capacity.
This was made worse by the fact that inmates allegedly set one prison on fire last week. This meant nearly 4,000 inmates were transported to other facilities where they didn't have beds.
South Africa's Commissioner of Prisons Makgothi Thobakgale said Zuma had reported to the Estcourt Correctional Facility in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal on Friday morning and was ""admitted"" into the system, before being released an hour later. 
Lobby group AfriForum has accused South Africa's prisons department of helping Zuma evade justice. 
South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, has said it will legally challenge the remission granted to the former president. While the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has welcomed the decision and said it is in the best interest of the country. 
More broadly the reaction has also been mixed. Some South Africans say the government should focus on pressing issues such as frequent power outages, high crime rates, poverty and youth unemployment, while others say Zuma should go back to jail to serve the rest of his term. 
Zuma's jailing in 2021 sparked protests and riots that left more than 350 people dead.
He was sentenced after refusing to testify before a panel probing financial sleaze and cronyism under his presidency.
He was however freed on medical parole just two months into his term.

Aberdeen student - I'm still starstruck after spacetrip,"This video can not be played
An Aberdeen University student has spoken of awe and wonder following a record-breaking flight to space with her mother.
Anastatia Mayers was on Virgin Galactic's first space tourism flight and floated around, experiencing zero-gravity, during the trip from Spaceport America in New Mexico.
The physics student had managed to keep her dream trip a secret from her colleagues in Aberdeen, who later gathered to watch her make history as part of the first mother daughter duo in space.
Keisha Schahaff joined her daughter after winning their tickets in a sweepstake. Also on board was 80-year-old former Olympian Jon Goodwin, who bought his ticket for $250,000 back in 2005.

Astronaut shares image of Brighton from space,"Emirati astronaut Sultan Al Neyadi, who shared the image, studied at the University of Brighton
An astronaut has captured an out-of-this-world image of Brighton from above.
Sultan Al Neyadi shared the image of the seaside city from the International Space Station, where he has been since March.
Born and raised in the United Arab Emirates, Mr Al Neyadi studied at the University of Brighton.
He graduated in 2004 in electronics and communications engineering before returning to the UAE to pursue a master's degree.
In a post to X, formerly known as Twitter, the Brighton alumni said he spent ""memorable years"" in the ""beautiful"" city.

What caused the Hawaii wildfires?,"This video can not be played
Watch: Four factors that made Maui wildfires so deadly
Hawaii is no stranger to wildfires, but those of the past few days are being called some of the worst in the archipelago's history.
Their toll has been devastating, although what sparked the deadly fires is still under investigation.
Hurricane winds and dry weather, however, helped fuel the flames.
Drought or abnormally dry conditions across large parts of Hawaii - including the entire island of Maui - also played a role. 
Wildfires generally need three ingredients: fuel in the form of biomass like vegetation or trees, a spark, and weather such as winds that drive the flames.
About 14% of the state is suffering from severe or moderate drought, according to the US Drought Monitor, while 80% of Hawaii is classed as abnormally dry. 
Dry weather sucks moisture out of vegetation, meaning it can catch alight more easily and then spread.
Scientists have calculated that 90% of Hawaii is getting less rainfall than it did a century ago, with the period since 2008 particularly dry. 
Maui itself was also under a red flag alert - meaning warm temperatures, very low humidities and stronger winds were expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire danger - before the fires broke out. 
Strong winds from Hurricane Dora, which passed Hawaii's coast on Tuesday, helped fan the flames even further. 
Forecasters are expecting a stronger-than-usual Atlantic hurricane season due to record high sea surface temperatures this year, which are adding energy to the atmosphere.
Last month, the National Weather Service noted that brush fires had been reported in Maui and briefly closed a highway. Forecasters warned at the time that ""the risk of fires during this year's dry season is elevated"".
Scientists also note that some parts of the Hawaiian islands are covered with non-native grasses that are more flammable than native plants.
This, coupled with dry conditions, can cause a spark to ignite a fire that can spread quickly. 
In a news conference on Thursday, Hawaii Governor Josh Green said that the wildfires were the ""largest natural disaster"" in the state's history. 
""We have never experienced a wildfire that affected a city like this before,"" Mr Green said, adding that the challenges of climate change were putting unprecedented strain on Hawaii. 
""We're seeing this for the first time in many different parts of the world,"" he said.  
The last major fire in Hawaii occurred in 2018, when winds from Hurricane Lane whipped up the flames around Lahaina - the same town ravaged by the fires this week. 
Five years ago, the fire destroyed 2,000 acres of land, 31 vehicles and 21 structures - most of which were homes - according to local media.
Wildfires were once uncommon in Hawaii, ignited largely through volcanic eruptions or lightning strikes. But in recent decades, human activity has made them more common and extreme.

Watch: Are wildfires in the US getting worse?
Climate change is increasing the risk of wildfire globally as it drives up temperatures and makes heatwaves longer and more intense.
Drier vegetation and hotter temperatures mean that once a fire is ignited, it can spread more easily.
The UN expects extreme wildfires to increase in number and spread to areas previously unaffected as a result of climate change and changes in how humans use land.

Oldham mill fire deaths: Police misconduct investigation launched,"A senior officer is being investigated for gross misconduct by the police watchdog after four Vietnamese men were found dead following a mill fire.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said two other officers were being investigated for misconduct.
It said it was assessing ""a potential breach of professional standards"".
The four men's remains were only found by demolition workers in July 2022, two months after the blaze at Bismark House Mill in Oldham, Greater Manchester.
Emergency services initially thought no-one had been in the property when the fire broke out on 7 May.
The IOPC investigation into the conduct of the three officers - regarding contact with the dead men's families - started in September following a referral from Greater Manchester Police (GMP).
An IOPC spokesman added that the senior GMP officer had been served with a notice that they were being investigated for ""a potential breach of professional standards that could amount to gross misconduct"". 
He said: ""It relates to an allegation that the officer failed to disclose relevant information regarding a criminal investigation into the recovery of the bodies.""
Two other officers have also received a notice that they are being investigated for ""a potential breach of professional standards that could amount to misconduct"". 
""This relates to the extent of checks and action that was taken following information they received,"" the IOPC spokesman said.
He said statements and interviews with some of the officers had been obtained and more lines of inquiry were being progressed. 
While notices are issued when there is an indication of misconduct, they do not automatically mean misconduct proceedings will follow, he added. 
GMP said none of the officers in question had been suspended.
The remains of Cuong Van Chu, Uoc Van Nguyen, Duong Van Nguyen and Nam Thanh Le were recently returned to their families in Vietnam.
Four people were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and remain on bail.

China property giant Country Garden warns of up to $7.6bn loss,"Country Garden, which is one of China's biggest property developers, has warned that it could see a loss of up to $7.6bn (£6bn) for the first six months of the year.
The announcement is the latest sign of the major issues faced by the world's second largest economy.
This week official figures showed China had slipped into deflation for the first time in more than two years.
Exports have also fallen sharply, while youth unemployment is at a record high.
Shares in Country Garden Holdings were down by more than 5% in Hong Kong trade on Friday afternoon.
Country Garden ""is expected to record a net loss ranging from approximately RMB45 billion [$6.24bn; £4.9bn] to RMB55 billion for the six months ended 30 June 2023,"" the company said in an announcement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The expected loss compares to a $265m profit for the same time last year.
The firm also said it has set up a special task force, headed by its chairman Yang Huiyan, to find ways to turn the business around.
Earlier on Thursday, rating agency Moody's downgraded the company's rating, citing ""heightened liquidity and refinancing risks"".
It came as China faced a number of economic challenges, which have raised questions about the pace of its post-pandemic recovery.
Earlier this week, official figures showed the country's exports fell by a larger-than-expected 14.5% in July compared with a year earlier, while imports dropped 12.4%.
Youth unemployment, which is at a record high, is also being closely watched as a record 11.58 million university graduates are expected to enter the job market this year.
On Thursday, US President Joe Biden said China's growing economic issues make it a ""ticking time bomb.""
At a fundraising event in the western state of Utah, Mr Biden also said ""China is in trouble"" as he highlighted its high unemployment and aging workforce.
The country is also tackling ballooning local government debt and challenges in the housing market.
Last month, Evergrande, which was once China's biggest real estate firm, revealed that in 2021 and 2022 it lost a combined $81.1bn.
It came as the firm, which defaulted on its debts in late-2021, reported its long overdue earnings to investors.
Evergrande has been struggling with an estimated $300bn of debts.
The huge losses highlight how much the developer was rocked in recent years by the property market crisis in China.
Problems in China's property sector - which includes everything from building homes to industries making white goods that go in them - can have a major impact on the country as it accounts for around a third of the economy.

Air India: Tata Group unveils new logo for former national carrier,"India's Tata Group has unveiled a new logo, branding and livery for Air India as part of a multi-million dollar transformation of the former national carrier.
The logo includes a design with golden, red and purple colours, and will replace the old one of a red swan.
The rebranding exercise comes years after Tata Group bought the debt-ridden airline in October 2021.
The airline was officially handed over in January 2022.
CEO Campbell Wilson said the company will not completely do away with the airline's iconic mascot of a cheerful Maharaja, which has been one of India's most recognisable symbols. 
But they would ""move beyond"" it while retaining the mascot's elements that spell hospitality and service.
Air India was founded by the Tata group in 1932 before it was taken over by the government in 1953.
In 2021, the Tatas paid nearly $2.4bn (£1.7bn) to buy the carrier which had racked up losses worth $9.5bn.
Since taking control, Tata has spent millions of dollars to update the air carrier's fleet. In February, the company announced a deal with Europe's Airbus and US-based Boeing to buy a record 470 new aircrafts as part of the airline's push to become a bigger global player.
At the launch ceremony on Thursday, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrashekaran said that the airline's immediate priority was to refurbish its entire fleet and bring it to an ""acceptable level"".
""The vision we have for the airline is also in the backdrop of a new resurgent India where the aspirations of everyone are limitless,"" Mr Chandrasekaran added.
Mr Wilson said that all of the airline's widebody planes will be refurbished with new livery by 2025. 
He added that Air India was also building new lounges at the Delhi and New York airports as part of its plans for a global lounge network that covered all destinations in its international route.

"Rohingya: At least 23 dead, 30 missing after boat sinks","The bodies of 23 Rohingyas who were fleeing Myanmar's Rakhine state have been recovered after their boat sank. 
Thirty others are still missing, while eight people are reported to have survived the accident. 
The survivors said they were trying to reach Malaysia when their boat carrying more than 50 passengers foundered and was abandoned by its crew on Sunday. 
Every year thousands of Rohingyas attempt the perilous sea journey to Malaysia or Indonesia. 
They are escaping persecution in Myanmar and overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh. Those who died this week include 13 women and 10 men, all Rohingya Muslims, a rescue team told BBC Burmese. 
The Muslim Rohingyas are an ethnic minority in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar. Many of them fled to Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a campaign of what the UN has described as a possible genocide launched by the Burmese military. Those remaining in Myanmar too have been trying to flee since the military coup in 2021.
Survivors of the boat sinking this week recall being struck by a large wave near Rakhine's capital, Sittwe.
They say the smugglers, who had been paid around $4,000 (£3,153) per person for the journey to Malaysia, then abandoned the boat. The bodies of the victims have been picked up by other boats, or washed up on the beach.
The long journey across the Andaman Sea in overcrowded fishing boats is always dangerous, but especially at this time of the year, at the peak of the monsoon storm season. 
Most Rohingyas attempt to cross between the months of October and May.
They are willing to take the risk - and often sell their only assets, such as land, to fund the trip - because of the unrelentingly grim conditions in which they are forced to live, either as refugees in appallingly crowded camps over the border in Bangladesh, or subjected to discrimination and restrictions on their movement in Myanmar.

University of Cambridge training continues for Ukrainian students,"A Ukrainian medical student who has been forced to flee her home twice due to Russian invasions said the chance to train in the UK was critical for gaining more skills.
Elina Sushchenko has been volunteering as a nurse at hospitals in Kharkiv but hopes to become a surgeon.
She is one of 21 students from the city undertaking a seven-week placement with the University of Cambridge.
The programme, which offers clinical training, is in its second year.
Ms Sushchenko said she hoped to help others by learning key skills.
The fifth-year medical student was born in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, but fled to Kharkiv when her home city was seized by Russian-backed rebels in 2014. 
She said: ""Kharkiv is now under attack, so at the age of 22 I've actually seen two invasions. Emotionally that has been hard, especially at such a young age. 
""But I also try to look at it as a time of opportunity. We are the future generation of Ukraine; we need to rebuild our country. 
""If we only stay focused on negative emotions, we cannot help. I hope to become a surgeon and we need to get more skills - to study, get experience and take this back to Ukraine and help others.""
The twinning partnership with Kharkiv National Medical University sees the students continue their practical studies at the School of Clinical Medicine and at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Royal Papworth Hospital and the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust.
Kharkiv National Medical University said the placement offered ""incredible value"" for students who had mostly been relegated to online classes due to the Covid pandemic and war.
Paul Wilkinson, clinical dean, said: ""Medicine is people-centred and the work of a doctor is about focusing on the needs of individuals, so it goes without saying that this kind of in-person learning with patients is vital for young medics.""
A spokesperson for Kharkiv National Medical University said: ""As a front line city, Kharkiv has been seeing an influx of wounded patients in its hospitals and clinics. This means that our students have limited access to patients for practical training, which could have an impact on their future education.""

Modi wins no-trust vote over India ethnic violence,"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has defeated a no-confidence vote in the  parliament after a three-day debate.
His government was not expected to lose the vote as his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies have a majority.
Mr Modi criticised the vote as an attempt by opposition parties to ""defame India"".
Opposition leaders say the vote was moved to force him to speak on the ethnic clashes in  Manipur state.
More than 150 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced in Manipur since May, when clashes broke out between the majority Meitei group and the tribal Kuki minority. Mr Modi  publicly addressed the violence weeks later, after a video that showed two women being paraded naked by a mob sparked global outrage.
The parliament session, which began on 20 July, has been marked by protests from the opposition which demanded that Mr Modi address the house on the violence in the state.
On Thursday, before the no-trust vote, the Opposition walked out of the parliament after Mr Modi failed to mention Manipur over an hour into his speech.
Late into his two-hour speech, Mr Modi said the federal and the state government were working together to bring back peace in the troubled state.
""I also want to tell the people of Manipur that the country is with you, this house is with you. We will join hands and find a solution to this challenge together,"" he said.
He also accused the Opposition of using Manipur ""for political games"".
""They have no faith in the people of India, in the abilities of India,"" Mr Modi said. ""They have tried in vain to break the self-confidence of Indians with this no-confidence vote.""
This is the second time that Mr Modi's government has defeated a no-confidence motion since it came to power in 2014. 
In 2018, a lawmaker had moved a motion over the issue of granting a special category status to southern Andhra Pradesh state. It was defeated after a 12-hour debate.

Russia launches first space mission to Moon in 47 years,"This video can not be played
Russia launched its first mission to the surface of the Moon in nearly half a century, in a bid to be the first country to land on the lunar south pole.
Moscow's Luna 25 mission lifted off on schedule from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Russian Far East.  
The Moon's south pole is believed to hold deposits of water. 
The Russian mission is racing against India, which sent up its own lander last month that is already orbiting the Moon.
Russia's space chief told Interfax the lander is expected to touch down on 21 August. As of earlier this week, India's Chandrayaan-3's spacecraft was due to reach the surface on 23 August.

Tears. Shock. Joy. Why viral Alabama boat brawl matters,"A violent brawl erupted on a boating dock in Montgomery on Saturday. And America hasn't stopped talking about it since. 
In the days after, dozens of video recordings circulated on social media, showing fists flying, a chair being slammed onto someone's head, and a man swimming toward the dock to join the fight. 
Some described it as ""the best fight I've ever seen"". But the videos of the violent uproar have also struck a chord with black Americans, who saw the fight - mostly divided along racial lines - as emblematic of the country's racist past, and a symbol for the ongoing fight for equal rights.
The setting of the brawl made the moment more poignant for some: Montgomery, Alabama, is known to be the birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement, the name given to the battle for racial equality in the US which, in the eyes of some, has not ended. 
""In short, I cried,"" said Candyce Anderson. ""My tears were of grief. This is a grieving process… these are tears that our grandparents weren't able to cry.""
Though she was not there to witness the incident when it happened, she was at the scene earlier that day.
Along with a dozen other women, she had gone to the dock to drop rose petals in the water to ""honour our ancestors"". 
""The path that we walked to the waterfront, just a block away was the path that our enslaved ancestors walked, brought into Montgomery in chains,"" she said. ""We cannot ignore the history, the ground on which this took place."" 
The man seen receiving the first blow was a black man who, in the words of Montgomery police chief Darryl Albert, was simply ""doing his job"".
Damien Pickett was a co-captain of the Harriett II, a riverboat carrying over 200 passengers that needed to dock but couldn't. A much smaller pontoon boat was wrongfully docked in the Harriett II's designated space. 
The occupiers of the pontoon boat were white men. Instead of moving their pontoon, they decided to hit Mr Pickett.
But before police could arrive and quell the violence, chaos erupted. Roughly two dozen people had joined the fight. 
Three men and one woman have turned themselves in after arrest warrants were issued by the Montgomery Police Department, and have been charged with assault. A fifth person, the man seen wielding the chair in the video, has been called in by police for questioning. 
Montgomery police so far have said they do not believe the incident was racially motivated. No hate crime-related charges or riot charges are expected, although the investigation is ongoing. Court documents show that an eyewitness - the white mother of a teenage boy working alongside the co-captain - reported hearing the men use racial slurs moments before launching the attack.
Mrs Anderson said the sentiment among the city's black community since the incident was one of fatigue, and solidarity with men who joined with the boat co-captain as he stood his ground.
""When a [boat co-captain] is just doing his job and saying you can't dock here you have to move, and he's met with aggression and racial slurs, that is telling of what many citizens in this city have endured for years,"" she said.
""This time it was - 'Enough is enough.'"" 
The fatigue, Mrs Anderson said, dates back hundreds of years.
When many black people think of Montgomery, they think of the city that was once the capital of the Confederate States of America; they think of the countless slaves dragged onto the riverfronts to be sold. They think about Rosa Parks' arrest for refusing to yield her seat to a white person; they think about where Martin Luther King Jr's house was bombed. They think about 'Bloody Sunday', the time when, in 1965, a group of non-violent protestors on their way to Montgomery were beaten and bloodied by police on horseback in Selma, Alabama.

It's with this history in mind, said Michael Harriot, a historian and author of Black AF History: The Un-Whitewashed Story of America, that the fight scenes on the Montgomery docks in 2023 were cheered by many.
""When people saw the black people, first of all, come to the defence of someone who was endangered and who happened to be black, and we saw the police respond by appropriately subduing the suspects, that's a rare thing to see,"" Mr Harriot said. ""If you're on social media, you see a million videos of police brutality against black people, you see a million videos of people calling the police on black people for walking through white neighbourhoods… it is rare to see such an explicit example of justice being meted out."" 
As a result, ""that caused a little bit of joy"", Mr Harriot said.  
Since the incident, countless memes, video re-enactments, and other humour-intended clips making light of the incident have flourished online. This includes the creation of a song called - the Montgomery Brawl. 
""Seen a couple of them boys go night night,"" the creator of that song, Gmac Cash, raps. ""And we got the first black man to swim to a fight. Salute!""  
The song gained 1.6 million views in three days. 
""When you see stuff like a song, that's a response that is - for lack of better words - part of our culture,"" Mr Harriot said. ""We turn [something like the Montgomery incident] into a moment of black joy that can last."" 
When asked how black people can celebrate what appears to be an act of violence, Mr Harriot said: ""I don't think we have to reconcile that or explain it. [Americans] celebrate moments of violence all the time. We valorise the Boston Tea Party. We valorise the Confederacy. We valorise so much violence in America and make it iconic. 
""If that [memes and the song the Montgomery Brawl] is wrong, then America is wrong,"" he said.

Staged videos fuel religious hate and misogyny in India,"In a video shared and watched by millions of people in India, a man is seen attacking a person who is wearing a black burka and holding a child. He then forcibly removes the burka to reveal a man.
The message accompanying the clip warns in Hindi that people should ""be aware"" of criminals using the burka - a veil used by Muslim women around the world - to disguise themselves and ""kidnap children"". 
The video, published on YouTube earlier this year, has been viewed more than 29 million times before it was deleted.
But it did not show real events. It was a dramatisation - a scripted performance with amateur actors.
Scripted videos, apparently created for entertainment, are increasingly being shared on social media as true events in India. Often accompanying the videos are false claims that stoke religious hatred and misogyny. 
India has witnessed growing tension among religious communities, particularly between Hindus and Muslims, since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in May 2014. Many of the false narratives that target these communities also encourage moral policing against women.
This trend of dramatised videos has reached multiple Indian languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi and Telugu. Sometimes, local media outlets have also mistaken staged videos for news. 
Many of the staged videos show people wearing burkas in order to kidnap children. This could have real-life consequences - over the past few years, authorities in many Indian states have had to issue warnings against fake news after several people were attacked by mobs believing them to be kidnappers.
These dramatised videos are accompanied by disinformation tactics which may confuse viewers on social media. Some have disclaimers but they may be hidden in the middle or the end of the videos. 
Most times, the text is in English, which is not always understood by viewers.
According to a fact-check by Alt News, the original clip of the man wearing a burka - which was later deleted by its creator - actually had a disclaimer stating it was ""a work of fiction"". But it was visible only for a second.
Other creators add CCTV templates to make the videos seem more realistic. 
One such video, which went viral in December 2021, was shared alongside claims without evidence in multiple languages that Muslim men were trying to intoxicate Hindu girls by spiking their food.
In the comment section below the video, many users appeared to believe it was true, making Islamophobic remarks. ""Beware of love jihad,"" commented a user.
""Love jihad"" refers to a conspiracy theory which claims that Muslim men are wooing Hindu women to convert them to Islam.
Most videos made by Hyderabad-based creator Venkat Seepana feature a recording sign and time-stamp like CCTV clips. His YouTube channel has over 1.2 million subscribers and more than 400 videos.
One clip depicted a tailor misbehaving with a woman. It was shared multiple times on Twitter and Facebook with claims that it showed a Muslim man mistreating a Hindu woman: ""Hindu sisters and daughters are requested not to go to the shops of Muslims, they are people with a bad mentality."" 
Seepana told the BBC that he made these videos to ""spread awareness and show real-life situations"". 
Alishan Jafri, a journalist and disinformation researcher, says that dramatisations that go viral may not lead to physical violence. But they deepen existing religious biases.
""These videos are adding fuel to the fire in the society that is already divided and polarised. Most of these videos are targeted against certain communities, particularly Muslims, and when they go viral, they contribute to structural violence against the minority community,"" he says.
Sometimes, these scripted videos - which spread confusion in the first place - are used to sow even more disinformation online.  
Some of them portray illicit relationships between friends, family members and people with a huge age difference. 
Two such staged videos were widely shared in May with false claims attacking the Hindu community.
The first one depicted a man dressed in saffron - a colour associated with Hinduism - who claims he is marrying his sister. 
In the second video, the same woman is shown standing next to him in a burka and he says he is marrying her to convert her to Hinduism. 
On Twitter the clips were used by some to claim that this was a Hindu man who was making his sister pretend to be a Muslim woman.
Both the man and woman seen in the two videos appear in several other videos portraying different characters.
The original clips can be found on a YouTube channel with more than 400,000 followers which commonly posts scripted videos. 
When the BBC asked Vikram Mishra, the channel's owner, if he was aware that his videos were perceived as real, he replied: ""We all want to become a hit. I make videos that do well according to the trends of society.""
He said the videos are created only for ""entertainment and views, as our team of 12 people earn their livelihood from our YouTube channel"".
The BBC also reached out to social media platforms with questions about their policies on dramatised videos shared out of context. 
A Meta spokesperson said they have ""clear rules prohibiting content on Facebook that incites violence"" and that they remove anything that breaks these rules. 
YouTube too said the platform has ""strict policies prohibiting violent or graphic content"", misinformation, and ""misleading or deceptive content with serious risk of egregious harm"".
X, formerly known as Twitter, sent an auto-reply that they would ""get back"" soon.
Many of the videos look and feel staged, and they are also produced and shared in other countries. But they are believed by Indians and go viral in the country because they ""cater to more conservative audiences"", says Harish Nair, managing editor of Fact Crescendo, which operates in India and other Asian countries. 
He also believes Indians ""share videos which they believe are issued in the public interest"". 
According to him, staged videos are not the prevailing misinformation trend in India. But they have ""a huge impact on society as they validate their pre-existing beliefs and sentiments"". 
Prateek Waghre, policy director of Internet Freedom Foundation, a Delhi-based digital rights advocacy group, agrees. ""Low media literacy is one aspect of the problem, but this is happening in a society where there are existing social divisions and people are already primed to think like that.""
But there are ways to check if a video is actually scripted.
Ruby Dhingra, managing editor of India-based multilingual fact-check media Newschecker, said viewers should be wary of camera angles, locations, reactions and the language used in the video. They can reveal if the people caught in action are hiding from the camera or posing for it, and if they are speaking naturally or being loud and overacting.
Dhingra also notes that it is ""highly unlikely"" that an incident will be captured by multiple cameras for its entire length and without any disruption, like the scripted videos.

Period poverty: African women priced out of buying sanitary pads,"Women on the minimum wage in Ghana have to spend one in every seven dollars they earn on sanitary pads, research by the BBC has found.
The BBC surveyed nine countries around Africa to see how affordable period products are. We compared the minimum wage to the local cost of the cheapest sanitary pads and found they were beyond the reach of many women.
While Ghana was the country with the least affordable menstrual products of those we surveyed, women across Africa are struggling with ""period poverty"" - something activists are trying to change.
Joyce, a 22-year-old Ghanaian, cannot afford to buy what she needs when she's on her period.
""The only person available to help wants sex before he gives me the money. I have to do it because I need pads for the month,"" she tells the BBC.
In six of the countries studied by the BBC, women on the minimum wage have to spend between 3-13% of their salary to buy two packets of sanitary towels containing eight pads - what many women will need each month.
As an assistant in a grocery store, Joyce lives with a family friend and survives on tips. Previously, she could afford to meet the cost of sanitary pads when it cost 4.88 Ghanaian cedis (45 US cents; 35 UK pence) per pack. 
However, after the government increased taxes on sanitary products, a packet of pads now costs 20 cedis, pushing them out of her reach.
The price rises caused women to protest outside Ghana's parliament in June 2023.
Joyce resorted to using toilet paper as makeshift pads, but when that proved unsustainable, she says she felt out of options and gave in to sexual demands in return for cash for pads. But Joyce's struggle is just one among many.
The BBC used the minimum statutory wage in each of the nine countries studied, and the lowest priced pads available locally to calculate its findings. 
Ghana was found to have the most expensive products relative to monthly income.
According to our research, a woman in Ghana earning a minimum wage of $26 a month would have to spend $3, or one in every $7 they make to buy two packets of sanitary towels containing eight pads. 
That means for every 80 cedis they earn, they have to spend 11 cedis on pads alone.
By way of comparison, women in the US or UK would spend considerably less. For example, in the US minimum wage earners would spend $3 out of $1,200.
Francisca Sarpong Owusu, a researcher at the Center for Democratic Development (CDD) in Ghana, says many vulnerable girls and women are using cloth rags which they line with plastic sheets, cement paper bags and dried plantain stems when menstruating because they cannot afford disposable sanitary towels.
And the problem reaches far beyond Ghana. The impact globally is astounding.
According to the World Bank, 500 million women worldwide have no access to menstrual products. 
They also lack adequate facilities for menstrual hygiene management like clean water and toilets.
Many menstrual health activists say removing ""tampon taxes"" is one way to help women inch closer to accessing and affording sanitary products. 
Tampon tax refers to the different types of taxes imposed on feminine hygiene products, including period products such as pads, menstrual cups and may include sales tax, VAT and others.
Campaigners further say governments still look at feminine products as luxury items, rather than consumer goods or basic necessities, meaning the tax imposed on them is akin to a ""luxury tax"", imposed on items considered non-essential, which only wealthy people will buy. These taxes are usually higher than on basic goods. 
In 2004, Kenya became the first country in the world to remove tax on period products. In 2016 it went further to remove tax on raw materials used to manufacture sanitary pads. 
Consequently the price of pads in Kenya has fallen, with the cheapest period products in 2023 retailing for 50 Kenya shillings (35 US cents; 27 UK pence), making it the country with the most affordable pads in our study.
However, women politicians and campaigners are pushing for further tax exemptions with the hope of lowering prices even further.
In South Africa, Nokuzola Ndwandwe, a menstrual hygiene activist, has been working to get VAT scrapped on period products since 2014. In April 2019, she managed a ""monumental victory"" when the government scrapped the 15% value added tax on sanitary pads and announced free sanitary towels in public schools. 
Countries that do not tax sanitary towels and allow manufacturers to claim tax on the materials used (zero-rated) tend to have lower priced products overall. 
But is tax exemption enough to ensure women and girls have access to pads?
In 2019 the Tanzanian government announced that it was re-introducing VAT on sanitary products, just one year after scrapping it. This was after consumer complaints that the prices had not fallen in the shops and markets.  
Campaigners say prices didn't fall because the tax was re-introduced before the supply chain of products had time to adjust.
Across Africa, and the world, lack of access to menstrual hygiene products due to high cost or because they're not available in rural or remote areas has had a huge impact on millions of women. 
While there is no single piece of research into how many girls miss school globally, studies in different regions and countries reveal that thousands of girls miss many days of education every year because they're on their period.
A study in Kenya found that 95% of menstruating girls missed between one and three days a month while another 70% reported a negative impact on their grades, and more than 50% said they were falling behind in school because of menstruation.
Marakie Tesfaye is a founder of Jegnit Ethiopia, a movement for uplifting women and girls that has been pushing for tax exemptions and has been distributing reusable pad kits to girls in Ethiopia,
""We found data that showed girls in Ethiopia would miss as much as 100 days in a school year calendar, and when they missed school we noticed several things would happen,"" she says.
""They would fall behind, repeat a class because they had no catch-up classes, drop out and get married or work as domestic workers, with little chance of ever advancing their education.""
Ibrahim Faleye was around 10 years old when he started buying menstrual pads for his sister. Growing up around girls in the Nigerian metropolis of Lagos, he thought it was a normal thing for every young man to do. 
""We were an average family and we could afford sanitary pads so I believed it was the same for other families. When I found out that many people cannot afford the products, I was shocked,"" he says.
Now aged 26, the public health practitioner has focused his work around menstrual health and education for girls and boys through his NGO, Pad Bank with the aims of stopping period poverty and helping boys learn to stop shaming girls. 
""In Nigeria we have this culture where men are not allowed to talk about menstruation. We take the men through that process so they can understand and also care for women.""
South African campaigner Nokuzola lives with endometriosis, a disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside it and can make menstruation very painful. She would often find herself struggling at work.
""I was in a male-dominated team and I didn't feel comfortable saying I felt sick. I felt ashamed and embarrassed and was worried about the repercussions on my opportunities,"" she says. 
""I thought about the millions of women going through the same thing. It was at that point that I felt it was time to deconstruct the narrative and end period stigma.""
UNFPA defines period poverty as ""the struggle many low-income women and girls face while trying to afford menstrual products"".
The UN says overall menstrual hygiene means women and girls have access to clean water and soap, accessible and clean toilets and latrines and the power to access these facilities in privacy without stigma and shaming, coupled with menstrual education for both boys and girls.
In response to the BBC research, Nokuzola says: ""It shouldn't be this way. The fact that a woman has to choose between a loaf of bread, sustaining her family and menstrual products is really sad and concerning. 
""This is a natural, biological process that comes every month so you have to neglect your autonomy over your body for the survival of your family. Menstrual products should be free.""
Nokuzola is now working to get a menstrual health rights bill passed in South Africa, so that period products can be recognised as a human right and women like Joyce do not have to resort to desperate measures in order to get them.
""We are suffering, I want to beg our government to remove the tax on pads. The truth is we are going through a lot just to menstruate. Why should I beg or starve myself just to menstruate? I think it is not fair at all,"" says Joyce.

Below Deck Down Under: Jason Chambers addresses sexual misconduct row,"Captain Jason Chambers from Australian reality series Below Deck Down Under has addressed sexual misconduct on the show's set.
He thanked the production crew for ""breaking the fourth wall and stepping in"" during two incidents during filming for the new series.
Two cast members were seen making unwanted sexual advances in recent episodes of the yacht-based production.
Both cast members, Luke Jones and Laura Bileskalne, were fired on the show.
The popular series is in the spotlight after two incidents were featured in the sixth and seventh episodes, which both aired on Australian TV station Bravo on 7 August.
Capt Chambers said the ""not acceptable"" incidents took place a year ago, when he was not personally present, after cast members had been drinking together.
In an Instagram video, he said ""I don't know what goes on"" when the show's crew socialise together, but added: ""If it's inadequate behaviour, you've seen that production would inform me.""
Luke Jones, who has featured in 11 episodes of the series, was shown entering the cabin of fellow cast member Margot Sisson without consent.
At the time, she was asleep after drinking alcohol and Mr Jones was undressed.
Mr Jones was shown climbing into her bed, which prompted the production crew to intervene to make Mr Jones leave the room, saying that Ms Sisson had ""said no"".
Mr Jones then attempted to close the cabin door and proceeded to hold it shut, before eventually leaving.
Writing on Instagram after the episode aired, Ms Sisson thanked producers for stepping in during the incident and said it was ""vital"" for the incident to feature in the episode because ""this issue is all too real and far too frequent"".
Mr Jones has not commented on the incident publicly.
During the same episode Ms Bileskalne was shown entering the room of another cast member, Adam Kodra, and attempting to massage and kiss him without consent.
The episode showed Cpt Chambers dismissing both from the yacht where the series is filmed and both have left the production altogether.
In an Instagram post after the show aired, Ms Bileskalne apologised, saying: ""I made [Mr Kodra] feel uncomfortable and no one should be put in that position"".
UK domestic abuse charity Refuge has praised the show's producers for how the incidents were handled.
It said the episodes had ""sparked vital conversations around consent"", adding: ""We're pleased to see that action was quickly taken to ensure a safe environment.""
Bravo has not commented on the incidents. BBC News has contacted the production company.
Below Deck Down Under first aired in March 2022. It is a spin-off the American series Below Deck.

"Ecuador politician murder suspects are Colombian, police say","The six people who have been arrested in connection with the killing of Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio are Colombian, police say.
A seventh suspect, who died from wounds in a shootout with police on Thursday, was also Colombian.
Mr Villavicencio was killed leaving a campaign event in the capital Quito.
The interior minister said a police investigation into the ""abominable event"" was under way.
Interior Minister Juan Zapata said officers would work to ""discover the motive of this crime and its intellectual authors"".
The six detainees have been identified as Andres M, Jose N, Eddy G, Camilo R, Jules C, and Jhon Rodriguez, Mr Zapata told a press conference on Thursday.
He added that during the police raid that resulted in their arrest, officers found a rifle, a submachine gun, four pistols, three grenades, four boxes of ammunition, two motorbikes, and a vehicle that had been reported stolen in the group's possession.
A vocal critic of organized crime, Mr Villavicencio was one of the few presidential candidates to allege links between corruption and government officials.
President Guillermo Lasso said the assassination was an attempt to sabotage the election.
He added that voting would go ahead as planned on 20 August, despite a national state of emergency. 
He said organised crime was behind the killing and has asked US federal agents to help investigate, with FBI agents due to arrive shortly.
Mr Villavicencio, a member of the country's national assembly, had received threats from a gang calling itself Los Choneros last month and had been given a security detail.
Following his murder, a video appeared on social media in which heavily armed men wearing balaclavas claimed responsibility for the murder. The men claimed to belong to Los Lobos (The Wolves), who are rivals of Los Choneros.
However another video appeared online just hours later, in which another group of men - this time not wearing masks - claimed they were Los Lobos members and denied any role in the assassination, claiming the other video was an attempt by their rivals to set them up for the murder.
This video can not be played
Fernando Villavicencio was shot as he left a rally in Quito
Where is Ecuador?
It's the smallest of the Andean nations in South America, sitting on the equator (hence the name) between Colombia and Peru.
Why was Mr Villavicencio shot?
He was one of eight candidates in the running for the first round of the election with a focus on fighting corruption - and he and his team had been threatened by the leader of a gang linked to drug-trafficking.
What next?
Once a relatively peaceful nation, Ecuador has been ravaged by the arrival of international drug cartels profiting from a boom in cocaine trafficking - and the issue can only grow in importance in the presidential election campaign.

Virgin Galactic: First space tourism mission after decades of promises,"Virgin Galactic has taken a former Olympian, a University of Aberdeen student and her mother to the edge of space on its first flight for tourists.
Ana Mayers, 18, and her mother Keisha Schahaff, 46, both from Antigua, won their tickets in a competition.
They became the first mother-daughter duo to fly to space together.
Jon Goodwin, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, became the second person with Parkinson's disease to go to space, a trip he called ""completely surreal"".
Mr Goodwin bought his ticket for $250,000 (then £191,000) in 2005.
The carrier mothership VMS Eve took off from Spaceport America, in the state of New Mexico, at 08:30 local time (15:30 BST).
Fifty minutes into the flight, the Unity rocket ship separated from Eve as planned.
A short time later, the passengers were given the all-clear to unbuckle and enjoy zero gravity, at an altitude of around 85km (280,000ft).

Ms Mayers, a second-year philosophy and physics student at the University of Aberdeen, immediately reached for the window to take in the views of Earth and the black of space.
The three then returned to their seats and strapped themselves back in ahead of the return journey.
They successfully landed back at Spaceport America just over an hour after taking off.
Speaking at a press conference after the flight, Ms Schahaff - who won the prize while flying to the UK to visit her daughter in Scotland - said she was still ""up there"" following the experience.
""Looking at Earth was the most amazing"" part of the trip, she said.
Mr Goodwin described his experience as the most exciting day of his life. 
Despite being diagnosed with Parkinson's several years ago, he was given the all-clear to fly.
""I'm hoping that I instil in other people around the world, as well as people with Parkinson's, that it doesn't stop you doing things that's out of the normal if you've got some illness,"" he said.
""The most impressive thing was looking at Earth from space - the pure clarity was very moving.""

Jon Goodwin: I thought Parkinson's was end of space dream
In a video posted on social media, Sir Richard Branson - Virgin Galactic's founder - shed tears of joy as he celebrated the mission from Ms Schahaff and Ms Mayers' native Antigua.
Sir Richard, who completed a similar trip in July 2021, wrote: ""Today we flew three incredible private passengers to space: Keisha Schahaff, Anastatia Mayers and Jon Goodwin. 
""Congratulations Virgin Galactic commercial astronauts 011, 012 and 013 - welcome to the club!""
Mr Goodwin was the first on a list of 800 or so individuals who have bought tickets for a ride on the Unity rocket.
Some of them - including Mr Goodwin - have been waiting over a decade to get their chance, and most still face a long wait.
Sir Richard first announced his intention to make a space plane in 2004, with the belief he could start a commercial service by 2007.
But technical difficulties - including a fatal crash during a development flight in 2014 - have made the space project one of the most challenging ventures of his career.
Recently, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin beat Virgin Galactic in the race to become the first company to take paying passengers into space.
Both companies say their missions further science as well as catering to the very rich.
But, space tourism has been criticised for its cost and environmental impact.

Donald Trump and Walt Nauta plead not guilty to latest charges in documents case,"Donald Trump and his close personal aide Walt Nauta have pleaded not guilty to the latest allegations in the federal classified documents case.
The fresh charges accuse the two men and a third aide of conspiring to conceal surveillance footage at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort from the FBI.
The former president, 77, and Mr Nauta had already pleaded not guilty to previous charges against them.
Mr Trump is fighting on multiple fronts as he mounts his third White House bid.
The documents case is led by Special Counsel Jack Smith, who is also overseeing a separate indictment of Mr Trump over his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.
Mr Smith's office on Thursday recommended to a federal court in Washington DC that Mr Trump face trial in the election case on 2 January 2024.
In June, he charged the ex-president with 37 counts, for retaining hundreds of confidential files - including about US nuclear secrets and military plans - after leaving office and for lying to investigators.
Mr Nauta, a former Trump White House military valet turned personal aide, was also charged in the indictment and accused of moving files to hide them from the FBI.
In a superseding indictment, prosecutors detailed an alleged effort between Mr Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira, the property manager at Mar-a-Lago, to obstruct the investigation.
The court document alleges the two men, at Mr Trump's request, tried to delete security footage outside the storage room where documents were being held.
That indictment added one count of wilful retention of defence information and two of obstruction against Mr Trump, bringing the total charges against him in the case to 40.
He had previously waived his right to appear in person in the Florida courtroom on Thursday. His attorney Todd Blanche entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.
Mr Nauta also received two additional charges of obstruction in the latest indictment, while Mr de Oliveira was charged with four counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements.
Both men were present in the room, but Mr de Oliveira was unable to enter a plea as he had not yet retained local counsel. His arraignment has been rescheduled for next Tuesday.
John Irving, a lawyer who represents Mr de Oliveira, did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. He earlier told ABC News arrangements for local counsel would soon be ""ironed out"".
In addition to the charges brought by Mr Smith, Mr Trump also awaits trial on 34 felony counts in a hush-money case in New York, and faces a defamation case from writer E Jean Carroll.
Georgia prosecutors are expected to bring state charges next week over the alleged effort by Mr Trump and several allies to overturn the 2020 election results there.
But Mr Trump has remained popular with Republican voters and remains the frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination next year.

Ukraine orders evacuation of parts of north-east,"Ukraine has ordered the mandatory evacuation of all civilians from 37 settlements in the north-east as Russia steps up its attacks there.
The authorities in the Kupiansk district of the Kharkiv region said they had to act because of ""constant Russian shelling"" in the area.
A woman was killed by shelling in the district on Thursday, Ukraine said.
Russia says its troops have gained some ground in the area. Ukraine says Russian attacks have been rebuffed.
The comments by the two warring sides have not been independently verified.
In a statement, the Kupiansk district authorities said residents of two towns and 35 villages were being evacuated.
""Do not neglect your safety and the safety of your loved ones!"" the authorities said.
They said that civilians were being evacuated to ""safe regions"" of Ukraine.
A resident in Kivsharivka - one of the villages being evacuated - said she was preparing to leave with her children, while her husband wanted to stay to care for his elderly mother.
""It's hard to leave them behind,"" Anna Koresh, 36, told AFP news agency. ""But since it's getting dangerous it's important to take the kids to a safe place,"" she added.
In its latest briefing, the Russian defence ministry said its assault units in the Kupiansk direction had ""improved their position along the front line during offensive operations"".
Ukraine's military said its forces ""successfully repelled"" Russian attacks. 
But on Thursday evening a woman was killed and a man was injured when a Russian shell hit a house in the village of Podoly, Kupiansk district, Ukrainian officials said.
The evacuation order is not the first for Kupiansk residents.
In March, children and people ""with limited mobility"" were ordered to evacuate from Kupiansk city because of an increase in Russian shelling.
Kupiansk - an important transport and logistics regional hub - has witnessed fierce fighting since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. 
Russian troops seized the city in a matter of days - but Ukrainian forces took back control during a rapid counter-attack last September.
Those advances - and the liberation of Ukraine's southern city of Kherson - were the most significant front-line changes since Russia withdrew from areas around the capital Kyiv in April.
Also on Thursday, one person was killed in a Russian attack on a ""civilian infrastructure"" in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia city, local officials said.
They said another nine people were injured.

Lahaina: Famous banyan tree and centuries-old church hit by fires,"Sites steeped in the history of Hawaii's royal past, a bustling art scene and the largest banyan tree in the US are just a few of the reasons Lahaina has long been a favourite tourist destination on the island of Maui. 
More than two million people - about 80% of all Maui tourism - visit the town each year, attracted by beaches, restaurants and what the local town association calls ""over a thousand years of rich history"". 
How much of that history remains standing after devastating and deadly fires swept across Maui, however, is still unclear. 
While the scale of the destruction is still coming into focus, local officials have said that dozens of businesses have been destroyed, including much of the town's iconic Front Street. The town's historic harbour, the Lahaina Town Association said in an update, ""is gone"". 
""They said the hurricane would go well south of the island, and that no one had to do anything. So nobody prepared,"" Theo Morrison, the executive director of the Lahaina Restoration Foundation, told the BBC. ""Then the fire and the winds started and we were in trouble. It was a total surprise."" 
Lahaina - which in Hawaiian means ""cruel sun"", a reference to the area's hot, dry climate - has long been culturally and politically significant, with a history stretching back to long before the arrival of Europeans to Hawaii in 1778. 
The first ruler of a unified Hawaii, Kamehameha the Great, conquered the area in 1795. Seven years later in 1802, Lahaina became the capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom, a position it held until 1845. 
Within a few decades, Lahaina was also a hub for the world's whaling industry and home to a busy harbour that brought in missionaries and sailors from around the globe. Later on, in 1860, the area's first commercial sugar plantation began operating, marking the beginning of a local industry that lasted until 1999.

""It's probably one of the most significant places in Hawaiian history. This is where the kings and queens lived,"" said Ms Morrison, who was travelling to the UK when the fire struck. ""It was a spiritual and cultural centre, and the first capital. It is super important... we take great pride in our history."" 
Until the recent fire, remnants of this past were everywhere in Lahaina. 
The city's Baldwin Home, for example, housed some of the community's earliest missionaries and physicians. The nearby Halo Pa'ahao - Hawaiian for ""stuck-in-irons house"" - served as a jail for rowdy sailors in the city's whaling days. The city's old courthouse was a heritage museum, filled with artefacts from Hawaii's history.
Many of these attractions are now damaged or destroyed, along with large swathes of the town. Other reportedly destroyed sites include a 200-year-old church believed to be the first on Maui, and a nearby Buddhist temple built 90 years ago.
""We take care of 14 different sites, and all of them are heavily damaged, if not completely destroyed,"" Ms Morrison said. ""The town corridor and all its historic wood buildings, those are all gone. So are people's houses, and the boats in the harbour. Most of them were commercial, like whale watching and dive boats. They all caught fire and sank. That really shocked me.""
Among the buildings destroyed was the Baldwin home, which also housed the Ms Morrison's Lahaina Restoration Foundation and a small museum. 
""The roof caught on fire and fell into the upper floor and destroyed our office,"" she said. ""I'm assuming that it also fell onto the lower floor. The building basically has to be totally redone."" 
Of all Lahaina's sites, few are as well known as the town's 60ft (18m) tall, 46 trunk banyan tree, which covers an area of 1.94 acres (0.78 hectares) roughly the size of a city block. The tree was planted in 1873 on the site of Kamehameha the Great's first palace to mark 50 years of Lahaina's Protestant mission.
The banyan tree - which sits in a park taken care of by the Lahaina Restoration Foundation - celebrated its 150th birthday in April this year. 
While its condition is unclear, images suggest that the tree has been burned but remains standing. The town's website suggested the tree will recover, saying that ""if the roots are healthy, it will likely grow back"".
""I tend to believe it'll be fine. It's really very hard to kill a banyan tree,"" Ms Morrison said. ""I would be very surprised if it wasn't fine."" 
Others have warned that some of the damage to Lahaina may never be fixed. 
""All the places there are tourist areas, that are Hawaiian history, are gone, and that can't be replaced,"" Richard Olson, a helicopter pilot who flew over Lahaina on Wednesday, told the Associated Press. 
""You can't refurbish a building that's just ashes now,"" he added. ""It can't be rebuilt - it's gone forever.""

US and UN concerned for ousted Niger president Mohamed Bazoum's health,"The US and UN are concerned about the health and safety of Niger's elected President Mohamed Bazoum, who has spent more than two weeks under house arrest.
""We are greatly worried about his health and his personal safety and the personal safety of his family,"" a US state department spokesman said.
The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) had given Niger's coup leaders until Sunday to stand down.
Ecowas said on Thursday it was still considering all options.
""No option is taken off the table, including the use of force as a last resort,"" Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, who chaired a meeting of Ecowas leaders, said.
""We remain steadfast in our commitment to supporting Niger in the journey towards peaceful democratic stability,"" he added.
Ahead of the meeting, Muslim clerics from northern Nigeria, which shares a long border with Niger, had urged President Tinubu against using force to oust the coup leaders.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was concerned about the reportedly ""deplorable living conditions"" Mr Bazoum and his family were in.
Earlier, his party said they were being detained under ""cruel"" and ""inhumane"" conditions, Reuters news agency reported.
Mr Bazoum was deposed on 26 July. 
Since then, a military junta has ruled Niger while Mr Bazoum has been kept in the presidential palace. Members of the junta have made no comment about the ousted leader's condition.
On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Mr Bazoum and assured him of the US's ongoing support, Washington said.
US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller added: ""As time goes on, as he's held in isolation, it's a situation that is of growing concern to us.""
Mr Bazoum's political party, PNDS-Tarayya, claimed in a statement that Mr Bazoum and his family had no access to running water, electricity, fresh goods or doctors.
The statement echoed previous comments made by Niger's elected prime minister Ouhoumoudou Mahamadou, who has said Mr Bazoum was being held with his wife and son without electricity or water.
The head of the presidential guard, Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani, claims he now runs Niger, while the junta appointed ex-finance minister, Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine, as the new prime minister following the coup.
A new cabinet has now been announced by the junta, despite leaders across West Africa demanding that they end the military takeover.
The new regime has also closed Niger's airspace until further notice, citing the ""threat of military intervention"" from Ecowas.
On Wednesday, Gen Tchiani met influential Nigerian Muslim cleric, former Emir of Kano Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, in a bid to mediate the crisis.
It was one of the first meetings the coup leader has held, having previously shunned several envoys including Nigeria's most senior religious leader, as well as delegates from the US, UN and African Union.
Also on Wednesday, France denied accusations from Niger's military junta that it was trying to destabilise the country. Niger is a former colony of France, having received independence in 1960.
Coup leaders claimed French aircraft had breached the country's airspace and French soldiers had freed captured jihadists in order to attack military positions.
""France firmly denies the new unfounded accusations by the putschists in Niger,"" the French defence and foreign ministries said in a joint statement quoted by AFP news agency.
They added that the flight had been authorised by Niger's military.
Both the US and France operate military bases in Niger as part of operations to disrupt jihadist groups operating in the wider region.
Niger became the main base for French troops after they were told to leave Mali following a coup there.
As part of diplomatic efforts, two envoys of President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria have met the junta in the capital Niamey.

David Hunter: Appeal against Cyprus manslaughter verdict,"Cypriot prosecutors are appealing against the manslaughter conviction of a British man who killed his seriously ill wife, his lawyers have said.
David Hunter, 76, was accused of murdering his wife Janice at their home in Cyprus in 2021 but was convicted of manslaughter and released from prison.
The retired miner from Northumberland said his 74-year-old wife, who had cancer, begged him to kill her.
It is understood he could face new charges of premeditated murder.
Justice Abroad, which represents Hunter, said it would work with a ""top team of lawyers to fight for"" him after the Attorney General appealed against both the verdict and sentence.
Michael Polak, from the organisation, said: ""We are obviously very disappointed with the Attorney General's decision to appeal which gets in the way of David getting on with his life. 
""He has spent 19 months in prison and faced legal proceedings over that period that would be difficult for anyone, but especially for someone of his age. 
""This is a very sad matter, however it is difficult to see how the continued pursuit of David assists anyone.""
Mr Polak said his client wanted to thank all those in the UK and abroad who had supported him during his time in custody.
He said Hunter had initially agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter but ""that resolution was taken away by the prosecutor on the day it was to be entered"" at court.
The murder trial was then held in Paphos before three judges agreed it was ""not a case of premeditated murder"" - which carries a mandatory life sentence in Cyprus - and Hunter ""acted spontaneously"" to kill his wife after she was ""begging him to do so because of the pain she was under"", Justice Abroad said.
Hunter was given a two-year sentence on 31 July but was immediately released. 
The following day he visited his wife's grave for the first time.
Mr Polak said it could be months before they were given a Court of Appeal hearing date.
At that hearing judges will decide if the pensioner will face the original charge of premeditated murder.
Hunter is currently not the subject of any bail conditions and is free to stay in Cyprus or travel to the UK.
Hunter, from Ashington, Northumberland, was a miner for more than four decades before the couple retired to Cyprus 20 years ago.
They had been teenage sweethearts and were married for more than 50 years.
The trial heard Mrs Hunter had blood cancer and begged her husband for several weeks to end her suffering before he finally suffocated her at their home near Paphos.

Candidate in Ecuador's presidential election Fernando Villavicencio shot dead,"This video can not be played
Fernando Villavicencio was shot as he left a rally in Quito
A candidate in Ecuador's forthcoming presidential election who campaigned against corruption and gangs has been shot dead at a campaign rally.
Fernando Villavicencio, a member of the country's national assembly, was attacked as he left the event in the capital, Quito, on Wednesday.
He is one of the few candidates to allege links between organised crime and government officials in Ecuador.
President Guillermo Lasso said organised crime was behind the killing.
Ecuador has historically been a relatively safe and stable country in Latin America, but crime has shot up in recent years, fuelled by the growing presence of Colombian and Mexican drug cartels, which have infiltrated local criminal gangs.
Fernando Villavicencio had received threats from a gang calling itself Los Choneros last month and had been given a security detail.
Following his murder, a video appeared on social media in which heavily armed men wearing balaclavas claimed responsibility for the murder. The men claim to belong to Los Lobos (The Wolves), who are rivals of Los Choneros.
But hours later, another video appeared online in which another group of men - this time not wearing masks - claimed they were Los Lobos and denied they had played a role in the assassination, claiming the other video was an attempt by their rivals to set them up for the murder.
Both gangs wield considerable power and the violence they have sowed has been one of the key concerns of Ecuadoreans ahead of presidential elections on 20 August. 
Mr Villavicencio, who was married and had five children, was one of eight candidates in the first round of the election - although he was not the frontrunner and was polling around the middle of the pack. 
Where is Ecuador?
It's the smallest of the Andean nations in South America, sitting on the equator (hence the name) between Colombia and Peru.
Why was Mr Villavicencio shot?
He was one of eight candidates in the running for the first round of the election with a focus on fighting corruption - and he and his team had been threatened by the leader of a gang linked to drug-trafficking.
What next?
Once a relatively peaceful nation, Ecuador has been ravaged by the arrival of international drug cartels profiting from a boom in cocaine trafficking - and the issue can only grow in importance in the presidential election campaign.
Mr Villavicencio, a serving congressman and former journalist, had condemned what he said was the lenient approach to the gangs, saying that were he to come to power, there would be a crackdown.
He is not the first politician to be assassinated. Last month, the mayor of the city of Manta was shot dead, while in February, a candidate for mayor in the city of Puerto López was killed. 
But the shooting of a presidential candidate at a public event in the capital is the most brazen attack so far and shocking testimony to the strength of the gangs. 
Witnesses say Mr Villavicencio was attacked as he was leaving a campaign event at about 18:20 (00:20 GMT) local time.
The event was held in Quito's financial district, in a building which had previously housed a school.
A burst of gunfire could be heard as the 59-year-old was getting into a car outside the building where, just moments before, he had been meeting voters.
Mr Villavicencio's uncle, Galo Valencia, described the moment his nephew was killed: ""We were just a few metres from the school when we were hit by a hail of about 40 bullets.""
Mr Valencia said his nephew had been hit by three bullets in the head. 
Carlos Figueroa, another witness, said that ""30 seconds after he [Fernando Villavicencio] left through the main door, the shots started"".
Video from inside the building shows panicked supporters diving for cover. In the chaos, nine other people were injured, including a candidate for the country's assembly and two police officers, prosecutors said. 
The suspect was also shot in an exchange of bullets with security and later died from his injuries, the country's attorney general said on social media. Six people have been detained by police in connection with the assassination after raids in Quito, they added.
A state of emergency has been declared and current President Guillermo Lasso has vowed the ""crime will not go unpunished"". 
Mr Lasso, who will not be on the ballot, said he was ""outraged and shocked"" by the killing, adding: ""Organised crime has come a long way, but the full weight of the law is going to fall on them.""
The frontrunner in the polls, Luisa González shared her ""solidarity"" with Mr Villavicencio's family, adding: ""This vile act will not go unpunished.""
Former vice-president and fellow candidate Otto Sonnenholzner also sent his ""deepest condolences and deep solidarity"" to Mr Villavicencio's family. ""May God keep him in his glory,"" he wrote. ""Our country has got out of hand.""

Barbie banned in Kuwait as Lebanon urges action,"The Barbie film has been banned in Kuwait and faces calls for a ban in Lebanon amid criticism in the Arab world of the movie's social values. 
Kuwait acted to protect ""public ethics"", the state news agency said. Lebanon's culture minister accused the film of ""promoting homosexuality"".
The blockbuster is however being shown in conservative countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia.
The film has grossed over $1bn worldwide within weeks of its release.
Lafi al-Subaiei, the head of Kuwait's board of film classification, said that usually the board asks for movie scenes deemed to flout his country's culture to be cut.
But when they promote behaviour the state thinks is unacceptable, they are banned outright.
The film ""promulgate[s] ideas and beliefs that are alien to Kuwaiti society and public order"", a spokesman for the Kuwaiti Ministry of Information said.
On Wednesday, the Lebanese Culture Minister Mohammad Mortada asked the interior ministry to ""take all necessary measures to ban"" Barbie.
He said the film ""promotes homosexuality and transsexuality… supports rejecting a father's guardianship, undermines and ridicules the role of the mother, and questions the necessity of marriage and having a family"".
Following Mr Mortada's call, the Lebanese interior minister and state judge Bassam Mawlawi asked the country's censorship committee to review the film. 
The minister is supported by the Shia Islamist movement Hezbollah. Last month its leader said homosexuality posed an ""imminent danger"" to Lebanese society and called on authorities to ban events that are seen the promote it. 
The move comes amid ""a wave of bigotry"" in the country, Ayman Mhanna, executive director of the Samir Kassir Foundation, a Lebanese rights organisation, told Reuters news agency.
""This is part of a broader campaign that is bringing together Hezbollah, the Christian far right, and other top religious leaders in a focused campaign against LGBT people,"" Ms Mhanna said.
The film has also fallen foul of censors elsewhere, including in Vietnam for featuring a map showing a contested Chinese territorial claim in the South China Sea.
Starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the movie tells a coming-of-age story of the children's character where she explores her identity and encourages fellow Mattel Inc dolls to express individuality.

US inflation ticks higher in July on housing costs,"Prices continued to rise in the US last month, despite a sharp increase in interest rates to stamp out inflation. 
The rate of inflation was 3.2% over the year to July, driven by higher housing, car insurance and food costs, the Labor Department said. 
That was up from 3% in June, which was the lowest rate in more than two years.
Analysts had expected the increase in the headline rate, after relatively weak price inflation last July.
But that said the report from the US Labor Department offered other signs that price increases were subsiding. 
""Underlying inflation is heading in the right direction,"" said Hussain Mehdi, macro and investment strategist for HSBC Asset Management, while Harvard economist Jason Furman called the latest figures ""unambiguously good news"".
The US central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate to more than 5.25% - the highest level in 22 years - in a bid to cool the economy and ease the pressures pushing up prices. 
Inflation in the US hit a peak of 9.1% last year, far above the US Federal Reserve's 2% target.
However, it has eased significantly as the shock to food and energy prices from the war in Ukraine has faded.
Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the decline did not imply that it was ""mission accomplished"" for the rate-setting central bank. 
""Still, we expect the Fed to skip rate hikes in September and November, when inflation should have decelerated even further,"" he said.
Compared with June, core prices rose at a relatively modest 0.2%. That was the same pace as between May and June.
Prices for some items, including used cars and airline fares, dropped last month. 
Many analysts are expecting costs for housing, which is weighted heavily in US inflation calculations, to start to ease in coming months, pointing to independent reports showing a slowdown in the growth in rental rates. 
But a recent rise in fuel prices could mean it takes longer than hoped for inflation to ease its grip on the economy.
Though the prices remain lower than a year ago, the average national price for regular gasoline in the US jumped above $3.80 per gallon earlier in August, up from about $3.50 a month earlier, according to the motor club association AAA.
""The recent trend is encouraging and confirms that inflation is headed in the direction [the Fed] wants,"" said Wells Fargo economist Sarah House. ""That said, we are cautious about getting overly excited.""

Judge orders Southwest lawyers to attend 'religious liberty training',"Three lawyers for Southwest Airlines must attend a ""religious liberty training"" course after a judge ruled the company disregarded his order in a religious discrimination case.
The judge sided with a flight attendant in May who said she had been fired for expressing her opposition to abortion.
On Tuesday, the judge said the airline ""didn't come close"" to complying with the ruling at the time.
Southwest said it would appeal the latest order.
The company's lawyers have been told to attend a course run by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative Christian legal-advocacy group. 
The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, has said the ADF is an ""anti-LGBTQ hate group"".
The airline appealed the original judgement when the flight attendant, Charlene Carter, was awarded $5.1m (£3.99m) and also got her job back.
She claimed she was fired after she called the trade union president ""despicable"" for attending the 2017 Women's March in Washington DC. 
Southwest and the union said Ms Carter wrote offensive posts on Facebook and harassed the union president in direct messages.
A jury in Dallas, Texas ultimately found that the airline had violated her right to religious free speech.
Southwest was then ordered to tell employees that it ""may not discriminate against... flight attendants for their religious practices and beliefs, including - but not limited to - those expressed on social media and those concerning abortion"".
In his highly critical 29-page order, Judge Starr said the airline ""didn't come close to complying"" with this.
He ordered a new, verbatim, statement to be sent to employees, and in his ruling included the Merriam-Webster dictionary definitions of ""may,"" ""does"" and ""tolerate"". 
The judge, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, said the company behaved as if its policy limiting what staff can say was more important than federal free speech law.
It was also ordered to pay the flight attendant's legal costs.

"Serial fraudster Mark Acklom freed from Spanish jail, court told","A serial fraudster who was jailed in the UK after conning an ex-girlfriend out of £300k has been released from a Spanish prison, a court has heard.
Mark Acklom was extradited to Spain two years ago after being freed from a near six-year sentence for scamming Carolyn Woods from Gloucestershire out of her life savings.
He had already fled Spain in 2016 midway through a three-year sentence.
The British man was tracked down to Switzerland and extradited to Britain.
But a UK court has now been told that the 50-year-old has been released from a Spanish jail after serving a further two years.
Over the last four years there have been a series of hearings at Bristol Crown Court to establish how much Acklom benefited financially from his crimes and his available assets in relation to the defrauding of Ms Woods, which began in 2012.
Prosecutors have been using the Proceeds of Crime Act to try to recover the money stolen from his then-girlfriend.
During his relationship with Ms Woods, Acklom posed as a Swiss banker and MI6 agent.
He claimed he was friends with celebrities including Nicky Clarke and Chris Evans, said he had spoken to Hillary Clinton and knew fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, and that he was involved with MI6 missions.
In 1991, Acklom, then aged 16, was given a four-year custodial sentence for a £466,000 mortgage fraud after posing as a City stockbroker.
He also spent £11,000 after stealing his father's credit card, swindled a former teacher out of £13,000 and ran up a £34,000 bill with a charter-jet company.
In relation to the romance fraud of Ms Woods, a four-day hearing to determine his financial liability was due to be held in November but that date has now been vacated due to the unavailability of the judge and will instead be held next year.
The court heard that lawyers representing Acklom have lodged new applications with the court alleging an abuse of process, to which it will take time for the Crown to respond.
John Hardy KC, prosecuting, told the court that he is happy for the full hearing to be postponed until 2024.
""I understand Acklom has been released from his Spanish incarceration and, reading between the lines, we do not anticipate that he will seek to attend the hearing in person but may try to attend remotely,"" Mr Hardy said.
Judge Martin Picton fixed an administrative hearing for 10 November and said a four-day hearing will begin on 16 April 2024.
No details were given about Mr Acklom's whereabouts, although he does have a wife and two children living in Spain.

The Elephant Whisperers: Oscar-winning Indian film in payment controversy,"A much-praised Oscar-winning Indian documentary is at the centre of a row over allegations that its makers did not keep promises of financial help made to an indigenous couple who starred in it.
The Elephant Whisperers made history earlier this year when it became the first Indian documentary to win an Oscar. It tells the story of a couple named Bomman and Bellie who care for an orphaned and injured baby elephant inside the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
But last week, it emerged that a legal notice had been sent to the makers of the film in June, alleging that they reneged on promises made to the couple, including giving them ""a proper house"" and ""sufficient financial support"".Bomman and Bellie confirmed this to BBC Tamil earlier this week.
The filmmakers have denied the allegations. In a statement to BBC Tamil earlier this week, the director and the producer said they had ""deep respect"" towards all contributors of the story.
The film's director Kartiki Gonsalves added: ""All the allegations made by Bomman-Bellie are false, there is no truth in their allegations.""
After the story made headlines this week, Bomman told a media outlet on 7 August that he wasn't aware that a legal notice had been sent and did not know the lawyer behind it.
But on Thursday evening, Bomman confirmed to the BBC again that they had indeed sent a legal notice and it hadn't been withdrawn.
AS Mohammed Manzoor, the lawyer representing the couple, also told the BBC that ""the claims that we have taken back our legal notice are baseless and absolutely fake"".
Shot in the stunning vistas of the Nilgiri mountains, The Elephant Whisperers follows Bomman and Bellie as they care for Raghu, an injured baby elephant who gets separated from his herd.  
The couple belong to the Kattunayakan community, a tribal group that has been protecting the forest for generations.
The film was praised for highlighting their efforts at wildlife conservation as it featured moving scenes that showcased the bond forged between the animals and their human caretakers.
The film's success at the Oscars had turned Bomman and Bellie into minor celebrities. They were felicitated by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin, who presented them with a cheque of 100,000 rupees ($1,207; £949.4) each, along with a citation. 
The two also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he visited the elephant camp in April.
But last week, the couple gave an interview to a YouTube channel where they revealed that they had sent a legal notice to Gonsalves and Sikhya Entertainment - the production company run by award-winning producer Guneet Monga.
The couple alleged that the makers made several promises to them at the time of the shoot which they failed to keep. The lawyers have asked for 20m rupees to be paid to the couple ""as a gesture of goodwill"", saying that the money would take care of their housing as well as their needs in old age. 
In their statement to BBC Tamil, Gonsalves and Sikhya Entertainment said that the documentary raised awareness and had a real impact on the community that took care of the animals. ""The documentary's success was a 'moment of national pride' that has brought widespread recognition for the work of mahouts like Bomman and Bellie,"" they said.
Bomman told BBC Tamil earlier this week that, despite promises made by Gonsalves during the filming, they had not received anything ""except the 100,000 rupees given by the chief minister and a government job"".
In the legal notice, Bomman and Bellie said they had not received fair benefits from the huge commercial gains made by the filmmakers.
They added that their ""skill, time and effort should be compensated proportionately at least after the roaring success of the documentary short film"".

"Taliban repression of women a crime against humanity, says Gordon Brown","The Taliban's treatment of women and girls in Afghanistan is a ""crime against humanity"", Gordon Brown has told the BBC. 
The former prime minister is calling on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute those responsible for the ""vicious"" abuse of human rights. 
The Taliban government has severely restricted the freedoms of women and girls since regaining power in 2021. 
""This is the systematic brutalisation of women and girls,"" he said.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4 Today's Nick Robinson, Mr Brown, now the UN's special envoy for global education, said: ""They've been excluded from education, excluded from employment, excluded from visiting public places.
""All these bans are a form of discrimination. It's probably the most heinous, most vicious, most comprehensive abuse of human rights in place around the world today.""
He said some described the system as a form ""gender apartheid"", and that it should be considered a crime against humanity. 
""It's right then for the International Criminal Court, which has responsibility for dealing with crimes against humanity, to both investigate and prosecute those responsible.""
The ex-Labour prime minister, who led the UK from 2007 to 2010, suggested the pressure of a potential prosecution could force the Taliban to reconsider, and said he was shocked by there was ""so little international pressure on the regime"". 
Mr Brown also called for UK sanctions against the Taliban leadership, and leaders and clerics from Muslim-majority countries to help persuade them that ""Islam is a religion that values women and girls"". 
The former prime minister's intervention comes as the two-year anniversary approaches of the fall of the democratic government and Taliban takeover following the withdrawal of Western troops. 
Taliban leaders promised a more moderate rule than during their previous period in power from 1996 to 2001. 
Last month Afghan women held a rare protest against the Taliban's decision to shut female beauty parlours and salons. 
Girls have been banned from attending secondary school and women excluded from university. 
Women and girls are also prohibited from entering amusement parks, gyms and working in non-governmental organisations, and must adhere to a strict dress code.
The UN has previously said women reported feeling ""invisible, isolated, suffocated, living in prison-like conditions"", with many unable to meet and their basic needs without employment or aid.
Around 40% of the country's 40 million people suffer acute food insecurity, according to the IPC scale that measures levels of malnutrition.
Fereshta Abbasi, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said on Thursday that Afghans were ""living a humanitarian and human rights nightmare under Taliban rule"".
She called on Taliban leaders to ""urgently reject their abusive rules and policies"" and implored the international community to hold them accountable for the crises their country faces.

French holiday home where 11 died broke safety rules - prosecutor,"A holiday home in north-eastern France where 11 people died in a fire did not meet safety standards, an official has said.
The blaze broke out early on Wednesday at a house in La Forge, where people with learning disabilities were hosted.
Prosecutor Nathalie Kielwasser said the building was not properly inspected and had the wrong type of smoke alarm.
The owner of the property, who lives opposite the holiday home, is in shock and has not been detained, she added.
The lodging had not undergone the ""obligatory"" safety inspection and ""did not have the characteristics needed to host the public"", Ms Kielwasser, the deputy prosecutor for the city of Colmar, told AFP news agency.
The building, an old structure recently renovated, had smoke detectors ""but not sufficient for this type of property"", she said.
Ms Kielwasser said it was not yet clear whether there were fire extinguishers in the building. The cause of the fire is not known and investigations are continuing, she added.
The building was being used by two groups of adults from two separate charities helping people with disabilities, the local government for the Haut-Rhin region said.
Nearly 80 firefighters were sent to the blaze after emergency services were alerted at 06:30 local time (04:30 GMT) on Wednesday.
Ms Kielwasser said the property owner, who lives opposite, was the first to raise the alarm.
The fire broke out near Wintzenheim, close to the German border and about 70km (50 miles) south of the city of Strasbourg.
Seventeen people were evacuated from the property. Those killed were 10 adults with learning difficulties and one companion.
The local mayor's office has said there were 28 people in the property when the fire started and claimed the owner had signed a contract to host just 16 people.
Photographs published in local media showed the partially wooden building in La Forge almost entirely ablaze early on Wednesday morning.
The building is an old barn converted into a three-storey holiday home. Firefighters said two-thirds of the building was on fire before they managed to bring it under control.
French President Emmanuel Macron said his thoughts were with the victims and their families and thanked the emergency services for responding to the ""tragedy"".

Why are tensions mounting on the Belarus-Poland border?,"Poland is sending 10,000 extra troops to its border with Belarus following an alleged incursion by Belarusian military helicopters.
Its government says they'll help to guard against mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group who have moved to Belarus, and who are now said to be moving towards the border.
Poland's government says that on 1 August, two Belarus military helicopters flew at low altitude about two kilometres into its territory in the Bialowieza region.
Belarusian armed forces were conducting exercises in the border area at the time.
Its government said that there were ""no border violations by Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters"", and described the accusation as an ""old wives' tale"".
Residents of Bielowieza have posted photographs on social media of a Mi-8 helicopter and a Mi-24 helicopter with Belarusian markings, which they say flew over the town.
BBC Verify has matched the serial numbers on the helicopters to ones seen at the nearby Machulishchi airfield in 2018.  
This military incursion comes on top of thousands of illegal border crossings into Poland from Belarus by migrants. 
Poland claims that since 2021 Belarus has been encouraging people from the Middle East and Africa to travel to Belarus and cross the border illegally.
Even though there are fewer crossings now than two years ago, Poland's border guard says 19,000 migrants have tried to cross the border so far this year, and 16,000 did so last year.
Poland's government has called Belarus' strategy ""hybrid warfare"".
Following the failed mutiny last June by mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, a number of its troops have moved into Belarus. 
The leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, joked in a conversation with Russia's President Vladimir Putin: ""They are asking to go west... to go on a trip to Warsaw... But of course, I am keeping them in central Belarus, like we agreed.""
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said a group of 100 Wagner fighters had been moving towards Grodno, a city in the north-west of Belarus on the Polish border, and described the situation as ""increasingly dangerous"".
He warned that Wagner fighters in Belarus could enter Poland posing as migrants, or that they could pose as Belarusian border guards and help more illegal migrants to cross.
Belarus' defence ministry said that Wagner troops were present in the Brestsky camp in the south of the country, about 10km from the Polish border, and were training Belarusian troops.
""Being mercenaries, its troops could create disturbances on the border which Russia and Belarus could not be directly blamed for,"" says Dr Barbara Yoxon, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Lancaster. 
The border between Poland and Lithuania is a line called the Suwalki Gap. 
This 60-mile (95km) strip of land is also the link between Belarus and the heavily-fortified Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.
Many military analysts see the Suwalki gap as a potential flashpoint area if there were to be a conflict between Nato countries and Russia.
The fear is that if Russia, along with Belarus, were to use military force to close this gap, they could cut off the Baltic republics - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - from their Nato allies in Europe.
""This is a very narrow choke-point,"" says Dr Yoxon. ""Russia and Belarus together would find it easy to block Nato from sending reinforcements to protect the Baltic states.""
Few military analysts believe that these alleged incursions indicate that Russia is aiming to attack the Baltic republics.
However, says Professor Malcolm Chalmers from the think tank, the Royal United Services Organisation: ""It's partly an exercise by Russia and Belarus to test the water and see how Nato might respond, or not respond, to incursions into Nato territory."" 
Russia and Belarus have signed a number of military accords in recent years. Belarus allowed Russian troops to invade Ukraine from across its border, and is allowing Russia to put tactical nuclear missiles on its soil.
Dr Anais Marin from the international affairs think tank, Chatham House, says the alleged incursions were probably a Russian idea, ""to make sure that Belarus remains an adversary of Poland and Nato, and a firm partner of Moscow's.""
Poland's defence ministry says it is sending 10,000 additional troops to the Belarus border. It says 4,000 will directly support the Border Guard, and 6,000 will be held in reserve.
In July, the government sent an extra 1,000 troops to the border to guard against potential incursions from Wagner fighters. 
However, some political analysts suggest that Poland's politicians may be exaggerating the threats from Wagner and Belarus because they are facing elections shortly, and want to show that they are tough on security issues.

Local resident Jamie Brown has been talking to Reuters news agency about having to evacuate his Puamana neighbourhood on Maui.
He describes finishing work at 16:00 local time on Tuesday and the area being filled with smoke. He says he, along with his family, ""left immediately"" and travelled to a part of the island that wasn't as badly affected.
Puamana is near Lahaina, a town we know as badly burnt by the wildfires.
Brown says he woke up on Wednesday to friends still in their neighbourhood sending him photographs of their house. ""It's just down to the slab, nothing but smoke,"" he said, adding: ""Came with the clothes we got on, a dog and two kids - here we are.""
We're wrapping up our live coverage of Hawaii's wildfires, the deadliest natural disaster in the state's history. 
We've heard harrowing stories of survivors fleeing into the ocean, spending hours in the water as flames engulfed the coastline. 
The current death toll stands at 67, but that is expected to rise further. 
You can read more here: Lost homes and missing loved ones after Maui wildfires
Or here: What caused the Hawaii wildfires?
The live coverage on this page was brought to you by Brandon Livesay, Marianna Brady and Frances Mao in Washington DC, Max Matza in Maui, and Rob Corp and Alexandra Fouche in London - with help from Sam Hancock, Laura Gozzi, Ali Abbas Ahmadi, Gabriela Pomeroy, Antoinette Radford, Franz Strasser, Mike Wendling, Anna Boyd, Thomas Mackintosh, Tiffanie Turnbull, Christy Cooney, Oliver Slow, Jacqueline Howard and Adam Durbin.
Much has been made about the speed of the fires and just how quickly Lahaina became engulfed on Tuesday.
Here's a timeline of what happened on the day in local Hawaiian time:
Max Matza
in Maui
Despite some residents
being allowed to return to Lahaina on Friday many of the evacuees at the War
Memorial Stadium shelter tell me they’re not in a rush to go back.
Most of them witnessed their homes beginning to
catch fire, as they barely escaped, and are certain that nothing remains to
return to.
For now, most are just grateful to be alive. That feeling
has grown as they learn more details about their neighbours, some of whom did
not make it out.
Donations
large and small are rolling in to relief and aid organisations on Maui.
The island is home to many wealthy people, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
He and his partner Lauren Sanchez have pledged $100m (£79m) to help the fire
victims. 
Sanchez
said in an Instagram post: “We are thinking of all the families that have lost
so much and a community that has been left devastated.”
“Jeff and I
are creating a Maui Fund and are dedicating $100 million to help Maui get back
on its feet now and over the coming years as the continuing needs reveal
themselves.”
Max Matza
Reporting from Maui
Lynette “Pinky” Iverson has been well known in Lahaina for
years.
Locals recognise her extravagantly decorated pick-up truck and her two-pound Chihuahua,
aptly named Tiny.

On Tuesday, her truck became a lifeline as she escaped her burning home and loaded “at least a dozen” people
into its bed.

“I tried to save people, but for some, I wasn’t able to,” she says.
“One lady didn’t want to come out. Another man was screaming for help.”

“By that time we were engulfed in the black smoke,” she says, adding that the
only things she was able to grab as she left were her car keys and Tiny.

As we spoke, I noticed something crawling around in the bedding of her cot in the shelter,
near her dog. I used my notebook to fling it to the ground where she squashed
it dead.

It was a centipede, which I've since learned are venomous. She says Tiny could
have died if she was stung.

Iverson was rattled by the ordeal. She’s no stranger to homelessness and says
she lived in her truck for six years before finally being accepted into a
housing community in Lahaina for disabled and elderly residents.
Now in her 70s, she’s hopeful that it won’t take her that long to find a new
place to live.
Captain Aja Kirksey said that of the 17 people the US Coast Guard rescued on Tuesday, two of them were children. 
She said that at 17:45 local time on Tuesday, they received an alert of people in the water needing help near Lahaina.
Conditions in the ocean were difficult due to winds from the hurricane, Kirksey said.
“It was a very challenging
situation for our small boat crews.”
And at first, helicopters could not come
close enough to assist with any rescues because of the smoke.
As for reports of dead bodies in the water, Kirksey said ""a Coast Guard helicopter did
observe one unresponsive victim in the water,"" but that’s all they can say with
certainty, yet.
Maui authorities have just said that, as expected, the death toll has risen.
More fatalities have been confirmed, taking the total to 67 dead. 
That makes it Hawaii's deadliest natural disaster, eclipsing the toll of a tsunami in 1960 that killed 61 people.
Lahaina residents who managed to evacuate and escape the fires are now permitted to return back to town. 
The governor has warned people to brace for the destruction.
The death toll stands at 59, the governor just said, but that is expected to rise as officials begin to search inside burned structures.
Everyone must leave by 10pm local time when a curfew will be put in place.
John Sudworth
Reporting from Maui
The causes of any single weather event are complex. This fire was made worse by the winds from an offshore hurricane. 
But Hawaii’s wildfires are becoming more frequent. Scientists point to changing agricultural practices as well as to climate change bringing less rainfall and longer periods of drought. 
And now the impact is being felt even by even the world’s wealthiest.
Questions are being asked about whether sufficient warning was given. Some residents report receiving text alerts… others say they heard nothing.  
The authorities, for now, are focused on the search for bodies.  
And while the official declaration of a major disaster means there will be assistance, many residents are wondering if they’ll ever be able to return to the lives they’ve left behind in the rubble.  
Even with the rest of Hawaii relatively unaffected, the scale of the task ahead is huge… a climate disaster stretching one of the wealthiest states, in one of the world’s wealthiest countries, to the limit. 
Hawaii Governor Josh Green said the number of confirmed deaths from the Maui wildfires has risen to 59.
All of those deaths occurred outdoors ""as people were trying to escape the fire,"" Green told CNN moments ago. 
He explained that means officials have not started counting those who have perished inside buildings.
The governor said they would probably have a complete assessment of the total fatalities by the end of the week.
Maui officials just gave an update on the local radio with more details for residents wishing to return to Lahaina.
As of now, which is just after noon local time, residents may enter the town if they show proof of residency. 
As we previously mentioned, a daily curfew will begin at 22:00 each night and end at 06:00 in the morning. 
The curfew is intended to protect residences and property, the county said.
Officials said that western Maui still has no power today and more emergency crews are arriving from around the state and the mainland US.
Max Matza
reporting from Maui
The mood has changed inside the war memorial stadium shelter. 
Many evacuees are on their phones, finally receiving updates on those that did not survive. Lahaina native Sione Pani just heard the news that his uncle didn’t make it out of town before the fires hit. 
“He was in his car with his wife,” he says. They were with at least one of their grandchildren, he adds. 
“They found them inside,” he says. “They couldn’t make it.”
He learned of their deaths 20 minutes before speaking to BBC News.
His mother, who fled the flames with him on foot on Tuesday, called to let him know.
Residents
are taking stock of Lahaina’s historic buildings, and one landmark hasn’t survived.
Waiola
Church sits on the site of a mission to Hawaii first established 200 years ago.
It was the church for Hawaii’s royal family, some of whom are buried in the nearby
graveyard. But it’s been completely destroyed by the wildfire. 
“It's gone,
the social hall, the sanctuary, the annexe, all of it,"" the church’s lay
minister Anela Rosa told the USA Today newspaper. ""It is totally
unimaginable.""
This is not the first time the church has been destroyed by fire or wind – it was most recently rebuilt in 1953.
There was better
news about another historic building, the Maria Lanakila Catholic Church. It
too dates from the 19th Century, but church officials say it’s
survived mostly intact.
The wildfires in Hawaii follow other extreme weather events worldwide in recent months. 
The University of Hawaii has said large fires break out almost annually in some parts of the Hawaiian islands, but that the scale of the current fires is unusual.
Experts say many of the wildfires around the world are linked to human-induced climate change that is exacerbated by the continued use of fossil fuels. Some regions - such as the western US - have seen an increase in the area burnt by wildfires in recent decades.
Here are other devastating wildfires over the past year: 
Max Matza
reporting from Maui
I was speaking to a family of tourists from Portland, Oregon, who were visiting Maui.
Staying at the Westin Ka'anapali – a little way outside the badly-damaged town of Lahaina – grandmother Lisa Schmidt, mother Erin Grayson and daughter Brooke Ferguson were forced to flee from the fires. 
Schmidt says she was most emotional when she discovered that the townspeople were not warned of the fires, that it “just took people by surprise that were in downtown Lahaina”. 
“It just breaks my heart that people just lost everything. Everything. And with no warning. The warning system didn’t work, that’s just horrible.”
They drove through Lahaina on their way to the shelter, and saw its devastation first hand.
“It looked like a bomb went off there,” says Ferguson.
 They saw cars that were burned up, and “houses burned to the ground”. Only random, “sporadic” buildings were still left standing, they say.
The Maui Humane Society, an animal shelter in Puunene on Maui island, is raising funds as it deals with an influx of animals who have been injured or lost during the wildfires. 
The organisation says it expects an ""inundation of hundreds of animals who have been burned, lost during the evacuation process and those in need of critical care due to smoke inhalation.""
Pets are often unfortunate casualties of natural disasters as owners are often unable to take them when they flee.
Local officials have given details about the reopening of Lahaina.
As expected, residents will start to be allowed back into the town in the next couple of hours - at noon local time (22:00 GMT). 
They'll need to show proof of residency and visitors will need proof of a hotel reservation.
A curfew will operate daily from 22:00 to 06:00 local time, Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen said during a briefing broadcast on local radio stations. 
Some residents are being allowed back into Lahaina, but Hawaii's governor has warned them about the scenes of destruction.
Here are some of the newest photos coming in from Reuters that show how the fire ripped through the town.
Max Matza
reporting from Maui
The situation appears to be slowly changing this morning at the War Memorial Stadium shelter.
Yesterday, evening new evacuees continued to flow in at a rapid rate. Beds and cots still overflow from the crowded gymnasium.
This morning, fewer evacuees are arriving, but volunteers are coming by to donate everything from fresh fruit to clothing.
One man told me he was offering people tobacco and cannabis, since he felt that was what he would need most if he was forced to flee home.
This is only one of six shelters on Maui opened by authorities.
Getting in contact with loved ones has been made difficult by poor mobile reception on the island.

Cheng Lei: Journalist held in China says she misses sunshine,"An Australian journalist - held in detention in China for three years as of this weekend - has spoken publicly for the first time.
""I miss the sun. In my cell, the sunlight shines through the window, but I can stand in it for only 10 hours a year,"" Cheng Lei said in an open letter to the people of Australia, dictated to diplomats who are able to speak to her each month.
""I can't believe I used to avoid the sun when I was living back in Australia… It'll probably rain the first two weeks I'm back in Melbourne,"" 
""I haven't seen a tree in three years,"" she said. 
The finance reporter was working for China's state media English-language television station CGTN when she was picked up, spending her first six months of detention in solitary confinement without charge.
In March last year, Ms Cheng was tried in secret and has been waiting for a year and four months to be sentenced.
Australia's ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher, tried unsuccessfully to gain entry to the court to witness proceedings.
Even her family is not aware of what she is accused, other than that it is said to involve passing on ""state secrets"".
In China, what constitutes a state secret is a very vague concept and can involve anything which the government deems to be sensitive.
The letter released today is filled with nostalgia of her life in Australia, the country her family immigrated to from Hunan Province when she was just 10 years old.
""In 1987, I remember camping for the first time with my family, my dad driving an [Australian] $700 [£360] car,"" she said.
""I relive every bushwalk, river, lake, beach with swims and picnics with psychedelic sunsets, sky that is lit up with stars, and the silent and secret symphony of the bush.""
In prison, the former TV anchor said that she ""secretly mouth[s] the names of places I've visited and driven through"" in Australia.
In what she describes as ""a love letter to 25 million people"", Ms Cheng said she recalls the kindness of strangers and friends alike and that the memories of such kindness ""have come back to me now and restored me"" behind bars.
She said she misses sea salt, black humour, the Queensland tropics and the never-ending blue skies of Western Australia, as well as the sand between her toes.
There has been some speculation that the sentencing of Ms Cheng has been delayed so that her case can be used as a bargaining chip in the Chinese government's dealings with its Australian counterpart.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been invited to Beijing to meet Xi Jinping. However, he is coming under considerable pressure at home not to make the trip until Ms Cheng and fellow Australian Yang Hengjun have been released.
The end of her letter contains probably the most important line: ""Most of all, I miss my children.""

Maui fires: At least 36 killed in Hawaii as flames destroy whole neighbourhoods,"This video can not be played
Watch: Hawaii wildfires aftermath 'like an apocalypse'
At least 36 people have died as fast-moving wildfires tear through the Hawaiian island of Maui, officials say.
The deaths in the city of Lahaina, the island's main tourist destination, came as strong winds from a distant hurricane fanned the flames.
The fire is one of several ongoing blazes that have burnt entire neighbourhoods to the ground.
Thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes and a state of emergency has been declared.
A huge search and rescue operation is under way, with some people still unaccounted for.
""We barely made it out in time,"" Kamuela Kawaakoa, who fled to an evacuation shelter on Tuesday with his partner and six-year-old son, told the Associated Press.
""It was so hard to sit there and just watch my town burn to ashes and not be able to do anything,"" he said. ""I was helpless.""
Five evacuation shelters have been opened on Maui and officials earlier said they were ""overrun"" with people. The island is a popular tourist destination and visitors have been urged to stay away. 
""This is not a safe place to be,"" Hawaii Lt Governor Sylvia Luke told reporters. ""We have resources that are being taxed.""
Firefighters are still battling active fires, with helicopters dropping water on the blazes from above.
The western side of the island, which is the second largest of the Hawaiian archipelago, was almost cut off entirely with only one main road open.
""As the firefighting efforts continue, 36 total fatalities have been discovered today amid the active Lahaina fire,"" the Maui county government said in a statement late on Wednesday.

Dozens of people have been injured since the fires began burning on Tuesday and hospitals on the island are treating patients for burns and smoke inhalation. 
Lahaina has been devastated by the fire and video showed the blaze tearing through the beachfront resort city.
""We just had the worst disaster I've ever seen. All of Lahaina is burnt to a crisp. It's like an apocalypse,"" resident Mason Jarvi told Reuters. He showed the news agency images of the city's destroyed and blackened waterfront.
Mr Jarvi said he suffered burns after riding through the flames on his bike to save his dog.

The fires earlier drove people to jump into the city's harbour to escape the flames and smoke. Fourteen people were rescued after jumping in, officials said.
Businesses around Lahaina have been destroyed, and one senior education official said they were preparing for the possible loss of a century-old elementary school in the city.
On Wednesday, the strong winds caused by passing Hurricane Dora eased slightly meaning pilots were able to view the full scale of the damage.
Images taken from above showed burnt cars littering the streets and smoke rising high above piles of rubble.
""It's horrifying. I've flown here 52 years and I've never seen anything come close to that,"" helicopter pilot Richard Olsten told the Associated Press. ""We had tears in our eyes.""
Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. 
The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

UN-Syria Bab al-Hawa aid delivery deal raises fears,"The UN says a deal has been reached with Syria to reopen the sole crossing for UN aid deliveries to its rebel-held north-west after weeks of impasse.
The future of the crossing had been in doubt after the UN Security Council failed to agree on extending its use.
The route from Turkey is a lifeline to 4.1 million people dependent on aid.
The terms of the deal are unclear, but aid agencies have expressed fear that Syria might now manipulate the distribution of food and medicine.
Syria had previously been excluded from any say over the process. Along with its ally Russia, it had strongly objected to the UN-authorised operations through the Bab al-Hawa transit point, describing them as a violation of its sovereignty. 
""We are concerned that the removal of certainty and security provided by Security Council authorisation will impact the ability of humanitarian organisations, and particularly Syrian NGOs, to operate effectively,"" said global relief group the International Rescue Committee.
The UN said the deal meant the crossing would be open for the next six months. Operations had been suspended one month ago after a dispute between Russia and other security council members charged with authorising their continuation. 
Bab al-Hawa has become even more important as a conduit for aid since a devastating earthquake struck north-west Syria in February, killing more than 4,500 people and displacing 50,000 families.
The UN said Syria had also agreed to allow it to continue using, for a further three months, two additional border crossings which had been opened with the consent of the Syrian government following the earthquake. Authorisation to use the two crossings had been due to expire on Sunday.

Hawaii wildfires burn historic town of Lahaina to the ground,"Raging wildfires fanned by hurricane winds have devastated the historic town of Lahaina on Hawaii's island of Maui.
Brian Schatz, a US senator from the state, said on social media that Lahaina is ""almost totally burnt to the ground"".
At least six people were killed in Maui County, officials said on Wednesday.
Maui's hospital system has been overwhelmed with burn patients and people suffering from smoke inhalation. 
""Firefighters are still trying to get the fires under control, and our first responders are in search and rescue mode,"" Mr Schatz said. 
There were reports early on Wednesday that some people jumped into the ocean to escape the fast-moving flames. The US Coast Guard said it rescued at least a dozen people from the water. 
Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen Jr said in a news conference that many homes and business structures were completely destroyed. 
One resident in the town of some 12,000 people told local media that every boat in the town harbour was burning.
""It looks like something out of a movie, a war movie,"" Chrissy Lovitt told Hawaii News Now.

Officials said it is still difficult to determine the true extent of the damage on Maui, and have warned the death toll may rise. Around 2,100 people have been displaced.
Some relatives of people living in Lahaina said they are worried about family members who are missing.
""I still don't know where my little brother is,"" Tiare Lawrence told Hawaii News Now. ""I don't know where my stepdad is.""
""Everyone I know in Lahaina, their homes have burned down,"" Ms Lawrence said.
Almost 13,000 people were without power on Maui, according to tracking website PowerOutage.us.
Thousands were without cell phone service due to the fires, and 911 services in West Maui were down on Wednesday.
Officials said that three large fires remain active and out of control on Maui.
Several blazes are also burning on the Big Island, also known as Hawaii island, a neighbouring island to Maui.
The National Weather Service said the flames were fanned by Hurricane Dora, which passed Hawaii at a distance but brought with it gusts of above 60 mph (97km/h), coupled with low humidity levels.
President Joe Biden said in a statement that the federal government has sent assistance to Hawaii as it battles the flames and continues with rescue efforts. 
He added that the Department of Transportation is working to evacuate tourists from Maui. About 4,000 visitors are trying to leave the island, said state transportation official Ed Sniffen.
The County of Maui has asked visitors to stay away from Lahaina, as roads into the town are closed except for emergency vehicles.
""This is not a safe place to be,"" said Hawaii's Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke.
""Certain parts of Maui, we have shelters that are overrun,"" Ms Luke added. ""We have resources that are being taxed.""
Lahaina is a historic town on the western tip of Maui. Its center dates back to the 1700s and is on the US National Register of Historic Places. 
Maui is the second largest island of the Hawaiian archipelago in the northern Central Pacific, located more than 3,200km (2,000 miles) from the US mainland.
It is popular with tourists thanks to its beautiful beaches and whale watching in the winter months and attracted 2.9 million visitors last year.
The small island has both dry, sunny microclimates and also rainforests with green and humid areas. Hawaii has a dry and a wet season, with drought conditions becoming more common on its islands.

Presidential hopeful shot dead after Ecuador rally,"This video can not be played
Presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio has died after being shot while leaving a political rally in Quito, Ecuador.
In the country's forthcoming election he had been one of the few candidates to allege links between organised crime and government officials in Ecuador, campaigning against corruption and gangs. 
A criminal gang called Los Lobos (The Wolves) has claimed responsibility.
Los Lobos is the second-largest gang in Ecuador with some 8,000 members, many of whom are behind bars.

Surrey shop accused of racism removes image of tobacco plantation,"A shop that faced racism allegations over a poster showing ""broken black men"" on a tobacco plantation has removed the image. 
In a video shared on social media on Tuesday, Misan Harriman said the signage behind the counter at Farrants in Cobham, Surrey, was ""triggering and racist"".
""There is no conceivable reason it should be there,"" he said.
The shop has since apologised for displaying the image.
Farrants sells a selection of confectionery, greetings cards, newspapers and toys, as well as hosting its own tobacco room, which offers cigars and tobacco.
The image appeared to show black people working on a tobacco plantation overseen by white men, which the store said was taken at Pinar del Rio plantation in Cuba in 1907 - 21 years after the abolition of slavery in the country.
But Mr Harriman, the chairman of London's Southbank Centre and a photographer who has taken portraits of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, said that it was irrelevant if the image actually displayed indentured servants or slaves.
""This is in a family store. This imagery is massively triggering and racist,"" he said. 
""It's an image of black men, broken black men, at a tobacco plantation with their overseers next to them. I kid you not.""
In a statement released on Instagram, Farrants said: ""The image that has caused offence has been removed.  
""We apologise unreservedly for any and all distress that it caused."" 
A statement previously displayed next to the image in the shop said it was displayed to ""honour, respect and recognise"" those involved in the development of Havana cigars.
Surrey Police said while no formal reports had been made, officers had spoken with the shop's owner.

Philippines: Six officers suspended after shooting teen in Manila,"Six policemen in the Philippine capital are facing criminal investigation over the fatal shooting of a teenager whom they had mistaken for a murder suspect.
Jerhode Baltazar drowned at a fishing village in suburban Manila after being shot in the head last Wednesday.
He dove into the water in a panic as police attempted to arrest him.
It was a ""lapse in judgment"" for the policemen to shoot him, given the 17-year-old was unarmed, conceded authorities.
""They cannot invoke self-defence. They were unable to prove that the victim resisted arrest,"" Navotas city police chief Col Allan Umipig told local television.
It was not immediately clear what led police to believe the teenager was the person they were after. They had been tasked to arrest a suspect in a separate shooting, which also took place in Navotas.
The six officers have been removed from their posts and detained while authorities investigate whether they could be charged with homicide, which is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison under Philippine law.
The shooting has been covered prominently by local news outlets.
In videos posted on social media, the victim's father, Jesse Baltazar, was shown clutching his son's body after it was fished out of the water.
Mr Balazar questioned why his son was shot in the head when the policemen had claimed they fired only warning shots.
The victim's mother, who works in Qatar, viewed her son's coffin through a video call. She told local TV she never imagined her next remittance would be for her son's burial.
The victim's sister, Jeraldine Tolentino, also told local media that she refused a 50,000-peso ($1,000; £698) bribe to discourage the family from pursuing the case.
Law enforcers in the Philippines have in recent years parried allegations of extrajudicial killings of crime suspects, particularly those involved in illegal drugs. They have denied wrongdoing.
Alleged summary executions of suspects who purportedly resisted arrest increased during the reign of former President Rodrigo Duterte, whose term ended in mid-2022. He is facing an investigation by the International Criminal Court, which he has refused to recognise. Mr Duterte is currently living in retirement in Davao City.  
Critics say his hardline stance against crime has fostered an atmosphere for police misconduct. He however has defended his signature campaign as necessary for keeping Filipinos safe from street crimes.
Duterte's successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, has dialled down his anti-narcotics campaign. However, state actors have been accused of involvement in high profile killings, such as that of journalist Percival Mabasa in November 2022.

Romania's forgotten orphans supported by UK charity,"It's been more than 30 years since images of emaciated children, abandoned in Romanian orphanages, horrified the world. 
In 1989 a revolution, triggered by the fall of the Berlin Wall, led to the overthrow and execution of the country's communist leader Nicolai Ceausescu.
His policy of forcing women to bear at least five children caused the placement of more than 150,000 children into squalid state-run institutions.
Now the country finds itself engulfed in another scandal, involving criminal groups starving and exploiting elderly and disabled people in adult care homes.
One charity worker who has travelled to the country for almost 30 years says more needs to be done to help the country's most vulnerable. 
Jane Williams, trustee of UK-based Christian charity Share, said orphans discovered in the homes were physically and psychologically deprived, with many not having any human contact. Some were left with permanent brain damage.
In a number of cases, she said, only babies in cots near the doors of orphanages had any regular human communication.
The Coventry-based charity has sent about 200 volunteer occupational and speech and language therapists since 2009 to work at a centre in Sibiu, Transylvania, and will again be taking a group this week.  
""Over the years we've worked closely with these children and got to know them, but when they get to 18 they have to leave there and go to an adult institution,"" she explained. 
""And the adult institutions are absolutely vile.
""There should be more publicity about them, we don't hear anything about what's happened to all these children after they left the orphanages.""
An investigation and raid on more than 30 adult care homes last month by the country's anti-organised crime prosecutors found gangs had been exploiting vulnerable people through inhumane or degrading treatment.
About 100 people were found beaten, unfed and lacking medication, the prosecutors said, describing ""torture-like"" conditions in the homes, prompting people to take to the streets in protest. 
The scandal has forced the resignation of two government ministers with the country's president, Klaus Iohannis, calling it ""a national embarrassment"".
Mrs Williams, 76, said she had first visited the country in 1994 with husband Martin through their links with Coventry Cathedral, setting up an associated Cross of Nails Centre in 1996. 
Community of the Cross of Nails is a worldwide network of hundreds of churches and charities promoting reconciliation.
A health visitor at the time, rising to become head of children, young people and family services at South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust, she helped start what is thought to be Romania's first ever parenting and ante-natal classes.
""When I first went into the maternity hospital there I thought it was a mental health ward because the mothers weren't allowed to wear their own clothes,"" she said. 
[The mothers] used to walk along the dark, dismal corridors holding on to the walls and they all looked pretty alone,"" she said. 
""And if they were from the Roma population they would have their babies taken straight off them and into the nursery.""
The Roma community is an ethnic group that has been persecuted and discriminated against in Romania and other parts of Europe.
""Abortion was was not allowed and contraception was illegal, and women had to be examined by gynaecological police. It was pretty grim back then,"" she said.  
Initially about 12 babies every month were abandoned after birth. 
""That's a lot of babies that were going straight from the hospital into an orphanage, and that was even five years after the revolution,"" she said. 
In 2009 the charity set up the Bianca Project - named after one baby with brain damage Mrs Williams would see on every visit. 
""One year I went to see her but she wasn't at home with her parents and I heard that she had been taken into care,"" she said, before eventually finding her at a centre for children with complex needs, Speranta.
Mrs Williams said she had worked with the director of the centre on a scheme providing support from newly qualified occupational therapists from Coventry University during the summer holidays.
It was later expanded to also include speech and language therapists.
But, she said, a lot of the affected orphans remained forgotten in the many adult institutions across the country. 
The last time Mrs Williams visited an adult institution, just outside Sibiu, there was an area in the middle of it where people were put in ""cages"" because of issues with violence, she said.
The therapy volunteers had been working with three children from Speranta - Bianca, Alex and Ionut - for about 10 years, she said, ""and we could not bear the thought of them going into an adult institution because we had got to know them, we'd taken them out, we had socialised them"".
A generous donation from a priest at the cathedral, the late Reverend Jim Tysoe, meant the charity was able to set up the three young adults in their own home - Jim's House. 
They are cared for there by another UK charity, Love Light Romania.
""We moved them to Jim's House in October 2019 and they are amazing,"" said Mrs Williams. 
""They've lived in an institution all of their lives but never had their own clothes to wear, their own personal belongings, nothing was theirs. It's wonderful to see them so happy,"" she said. 
""Bianca even has her own job at a local chocolate factory twice a week. When she moved she said she felt like a proper person, she had never felt like that before.""
Raising funds is a continual struggle, she said, as the charity has to find £2,000 a month for the three young people.  
""I can't bear the thought of what will happen to these children if we can't find the money to pay for them every month,"" she said. 
Romania has been forgotten, she added. 
""If you go to any of the big cities in Romania, like Bucharest or Brasov, you would not see what is happening outside of cities and not see underneath the surface and realise how difficult things are.
""There's a Hilton in Sibiu, but five miles up the road from there are people living in very poor conditions without access to mains water or sewerage. 
""And this is today, in Europe, in a country that is in the EU,"" she added.

Physics student kept dream space flight secret from work,"A physics student who won a place on Virgin Galactic's second commercial flight into space kept the dream news a secret from her colleagues. 
Anastatia Mayers and her mother Keisha Schahaff will be the first mother and daughter to go to space on Thursday.
But the 18-year-old's co-workers only learned of her voyage from a news report posted in their work group chat.
They will be tuning in to watch the scheduled launch in New Mexico at 15:30 BST.
Julia Lisicka, a manager at the Mexican restaurant FreshMex in Aberdeen, said the news about Anastatia had come as an ""extraordinary surprise"".
Staff learned about it after one of the restaurant's owners posted an article about it in their work group chat.
""It was very funny because she never mentioned it,"" Julia told BBC Scotland News. 
""We were like laughing 'did you book off the day that you're flying to space?'. 
""She never said a word, it was a secret until it came out through the news. We're very excited for her.""
The mission Anastatia and her mother will embark on is named Galactic 02. It is the first commercial space flight with paying customers onboard.
The advertised price for a ride on the rocket plane has been as high as $450,000 (£350,000). 
Keisha entered the competition for a place onboard after seeing an advert for it pop up while on a Virgin Atlantic flight.
She was travelling to the UK from Antigua in the Caribbean to sort out her daughter's visa as Anastatia had decided to study at the University of Aberdeen. 
She is currently enrolled there and studying for a degree in philosophy and physics. 
Dr Ross MacPherson, the head of undergraduate physics at the university said he is looking forward to hearing about her experience first-hand. 
""We're all really excited about it. There's only been I think 620 people who have been into space and now one of our students is one of them so it's fantastically exciting,"" he said.
""We're in the physics department so being in space, being an astronaut - that's something a lot of us have as a dream. I think a lot of us are excited for term to start again to talk to her about the experience.""
Anastatia will be the second-youngest person to go to space.
The launch window for the Galactic 02 opens at 08:30 local time (15:30 BST) and it will be blasting off from a spaceport in New Mexico. 
Julia said she and others working at FreshMex will be tuning into watch the takeoff in-between rolling burritos.
""We're going to get a laptop, put the transmission on and just watch it all together,"" she said. 
""She's very much into girl power so she always said that she wants to inspire little girls around the world.
""It's very inspiring for little girls and even us bigger girls - Ana is younger than me and I'm very much inspired.""

German official accused of spying for Russia,"A government official has been arrested in Germany, accused of passing secret information to Russia. 
The man has been named only as Thomas H, in line with German privacy rules.
He worked for an office dealing with military equipment and information technology. 
It is alleged he went on his own initiative to the Russian embassy in Berlin, and also to its consulate in the city of Bonn, where he offered his services. 
He was brought before a judge on Wednesday and was detained, pending a trial.
""The federal prosecutor has arrested a German officer on suspicion of working for a foreign secret service,"" wrote Justice Minister Marco Buschmann on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. ""Vigilance is the order of the day.""
The man allegedly handed over information obtained during the course of his work with the intention that it be passed to a Russian intelligence service, the federal prosecutor's office said.
He was arrested in Koblenz in western Germany, and his home and workplace were searched, it added. 
The arrest came after the domestic security agency, the BfV, warned in June against the risk of an ""aggressive Russian espionage operation"" as Moscow wages its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
This is not the first case of its kind since the Russian invasion in February last year. 
In January, a German citizen was arrested on suspicion of treason for alleged involvement in a scheme to pass intelligence to Russia.
The man, named only as Arthur E, was thought to be linked to a German foreign intelligence service (BND) employee who was arrested in December for allegedly spying for Russia.

"Virgin Galactic: Mum, daughter and Brit, 80, count down to space flight","A rocket plane is due to fly from New Mexico carrying an 80-year-old British former Olympian, an Aberdeen student and her mother into space.
Anastatia Mayers and her mother Keisha Schahaff won the tickets to board the Virgin Galactic flight in a competition.
Jon Goodwin, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, will become the second person with Parkinson's disease to go to space.
The mission will be seen as another test of how viable space tourism is.
The launch window for the Virgin Galactic 02 flight opens at 08:30 local time (15:30 BST). It is Virgin Galactic's second commercial flight. The first was in June when the Italian Air Force and scientists conducted experiments in weightless conditions on a 70-minute mission.
The Unity rocket plane is carried on the first stage of its journey slung underneath a carrier jet, known as Eve. Unity will then aim to ignite its engine and travel to an altitude of 279,000ft (85km).
The advertised price for a place on a Virgin Galactic flight has been as high as $450,000 (£350,000). Mr Goodwin, who competed in the 1972 Olympics as a canoeist, paid $250,000 for his ticket in 2005 but had feared his diagnosis would mean he could not take part.
He said he wanted to prove that his condition - Parkinson's disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged - did not define him.
Around 100 people will watch him travel into space at a party in Stoke-on-Trent organised by Parkinson's UK.
Ms Schahaff, from Antigua, was flying to the UK to sort out her daughter's visa when she entered a competition to join the spaceflight.
She found out months later that she had won two spaceflight seats in the draw.
""Suddenly, who's walking into my yard? Richard Branson. The whole team just swarmed into my house saying 'you're the winner, you're going to space',"" she said. 
Her daughter Anastatia will become the second-youngest person to go to space, and says she hopes to inspire others.
""That would be very important to me, both in Scotland and Antigua and anywhere else I have any ties,"" she says.
""My intention is to just break any barriers that we set for ourselves or that the world sets for us.""
The flight will aim to reach the edge of space, around 53 miles (85km) above Earth, where the passengers will have a few minutes to experience weightlessness.
The spaceship does not have the velocity to complete a full orbit of the globe.
Jon Goodwin is the first on a list of 800 or so individuals who have bought tickets for a ride on the Unity rocket.
Some of them have been waiting over a decade to get their chance, and most will have a long wait still.
US multi-millionaire Dennis Tito became the world's first ever space tourist in 2001, paying a reported $20m.
Recently, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin beat Virgin Galactic in the race to become the first company to take paying passengers into space.
Both companies say their missions further science as well as catering to the very rich, but space tourism has been criticised for its cost and environmental impact.

Images show devastation of Hawaii wildfires,"Wildfires on the Hawaii island of Maui have destroyed homes and businesses and displaced thousands. 
The hardest hit is the historic town of Lahaina. Officials reported at least six people have been killed in the fires. 
The fires continue to rage as of Wednesday afternoon, with firefighting efforts and search and rescue missions underway. 
Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden has deployed federal resources to help.
Aerial images show several buildings destroyed by the fires in Lahaina, though officials said it is still difficult to determine the true extent of the damage. 
The fires were fanned by a combination of low humidity and winds from a distant Hurricane Dora, the National Weather Service said, which brought with it gusts of above 60 mph (97 kph). The flames spread along Lahaina's coast, burning boats and the town's harbour. 
The path of the flames can be seen by images captured by satellite. Some have reportedly jumped into the ocean to escape the flames, and the US Coast Guard said it rescued at least a dozen people from the water.
Lahaina is a historic town on the western tip of Maui. It is home to 12,000 residents and is also a popular destination for tourists. The fires have displaced round 2,100 locals who have been housed in shelters.
Thousands remain without power or cell phone service due to the fires, and 911 services in West Maui were down on Wednesday. Roads into Lahaina were closed except for emergency vehicles, as officials warned visitors to stay away for their own safety.

Pakistan: Election likely to be delayed in latest political crisis,"Pakistan's parliament has been formally dissolved, but polls meant to be held within 90 days will likely be delayed.
The electoral commission says electoral boundaries must be redrawn to reflect fresh census data, a months-long process.
Last week, former prime minister Imran Khan was arrested and jailed, and then barred from politics for five years.
He had openly challenged the powerful military establishment and claimed it was ""petrified"" of elections.
With President Arif Alvi's order on Wednesday to dissolve the National Assembly, a caretaker government will take charge. Outgoing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his government have been given three days to name an interim leader.
A Election Commission of Pakistan official told the BBC: ""The elections will be held once the census is done, which will take about four months' time. As a result, the elections may be delayed till next year.""
Mr Sharif, who warned that the country cannot progress without ""national unity"", also told reporters recently that polls may not be held this year.  
Some feel the election is being delayed as  the ruling Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) coalition isn't confident about winning at the polls, due to Mr Khan's enduring popularity, as well as the effects of runaway inflation despite a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.
Despite their once close relationship, Mr Khan has rattled the military like no other politician before him. Senior analyst Rasool Bakhsh Raees even reckons that the former cricket star's detention will increase his popularity.
In May, Mr Khan's arrest on corruption charges sparked nationwide protests that saw at least eight deaths and some 1,400 arrests, amid unprecedented attacks on military property and buildings.
The 70-year old, who is appealing his conviction on graft charges, has claimed that the military's goal was to ""eventually put me into prison and to crush my party.""  
But the rule remains the same: anyone who challenges Pakistan's military, even someone with the charisma and international stature of Mr Khan, must go. The former cricket star is simply the latest politician since the 1970s to find this out the hard way. 
As former senator Afrasiab Khattak told the BBC, there are two systems of government operating in parallel. Now, ""the unsanctioned, de facto force wants to take over the parliamentary process,"" said Mr Khattak. ""Pakistan's military has always been powerful, but they want more powers so that their unsanctioned rule is not challenged either by politicians, activists, or journalists.""
Two draconian laws were tabled in the National Assembly last week, in a bid to further enhance the powers of the military and intelligence agencies.
Proposed amendments to the century-old Official Secrets Act will broadly empower the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) to arrest citizens over ""suspected breach of official secrets"". In addition, a new bill recommends a three-year jail term for anyone who discloses the identity of an intelligence official. 
The amendments provoked a ruckus in parliament, with both the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and PML-N's coalition partners calling the government out for passing ""draconian laws in haste"" and without discussion. 
Senator Mushtaq Ahmed of Jamaat-e-Islami also warned that the Official Secrets Act amendment will grant intelligence agencies ""extraordinary powers"" of arrest and search without warrant. ""This will have an impact on the human rights, individual rights and press freedom across the country."" 
The Pakistani intelligence services are regularly accused of illegally detaining opposition members, politicians, activists and journalists, with human rights organisations noting the increasing number of enforced disappearances every month. 
In the month of July alone, 157 more cases of enforced disappearances were reported, according to the government-led Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. 
The bills have been sent to President Alvi, a co-founder of the PTI, and must be signed by him before they can be legislated into law.

"Boy, 6, boasted about shooting Virginia teacher Abigail Zwerner","The six-year-old student who shot his teacher in the US earlier this year, boasted about the incident saying ""I shot [her] dead"", unsealed court documents show. 
While being restrained after the shooting at a Virginia school, the boy is said to have admitted ""I did it"", adding ""I got my mom's gun last night"". 
His teacher, Abigail ""Abby"" Zwerner - who survived - filed a $40m (£31.4m) lawsuit earlier this year. 
The boy has not been charged. 
The boy's mother, however, Deja Taylor, has been charged with felony child neglect and misdemeanour recklessly leaving a loaded firearm as to endanger a child. 
In June, she was also charged with unlawfully using a controlled substance while in possession of a firearm and making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm.
Ms Taylor will be sentenced in October and could face up to 25 years in prison. 
Using his mother's gun, the boy shot his first-grade teacher, Ms Zwerner, in the hand and chest on 6 January at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia.

Watch: Police chief says teacher Abby Zwerner saved lives
After the shooting, Ms Zwerner told police at hospital that she saw the child standing by his desk when he ""pulled a firearm out of his jacket pocket and pointed it"" at her, according to the newly released documents.
Before he shot the 9mm handgun, she said, ""What are you doing with that?""
The primary teacher has undergone surgery four times.
Amy Korvac, a reading specialist at the school, heard the gun shots and restrained the student until police arrived. It was during this time that the boy allegedly confessed to the shooting, using a profanity to refer to Ms Zwerner.
In an interview with the Washington Post published on Wednesday, Ms Korvac said she went inside the classroom after the shooting, where she found the six-year-old standing next to his desk with his arms crossed and a handgun on the floor next to him. 
She said she then took the boy's hand and walked him to the front of the classroom, where she used a phone to call 911. 
""While I was holding him, he told me he had gotten his mom's gun the night before and put it in his backpack,"" Ms Kovac told the paper. ""He also told me he only had time to load one bullet.""
The court documents also mention another incident with the same student while he was in kindergarten. A retired teacher told police he started ""choking her to the point she could not breathe"".
In Ms Zwerner's lawsuit, filed in April, she accuses school officials of gross negligence for ignoring warning signs and argues the defendants knew the child ""had a history of random violence"".

"Ola, Uber and Zomato: India's gig workers see hope in new state law","Gig workers in India are celebrating a small but significant victory in their ongoing fight for labour rights and better working conditions.
The work is gruelling, hours are long, the pay is meagre and there's no job security or access to basic rights like paid leave, insurance or pension.
But on 24 July, the western state of Rajasthan passed a landmark law that aims to provide platform-based gig workers social security benefits - a right they have been demanding for a long time - among other provisions.
The Rajasthan Platform Based Gig Workers (Registration and Welfare) Act 2023 proposes to set up a social security fund by imposing a welfare tax of 1%-2% on every transaction made by a customer on apps that fall within its ambit, like food delivery and ride sharing. State government grants and contributions by gig workers will also be pooled into the fund.
The law also aims to create an online database of gig workers in the state by registering them and the platforms they're associated with; set up a system to address their grievances and a welfare board to monitor and enforce rules and fine aggregator platforms that don't comply.
Many labour rights activists have praised the law saying it will give gig workers at least some of the rights enjoyed by those in the formal economy. They also say it will provide a model for other states to follow.
But critics argue that the law might slow down the gig economy by irking customers, who may end up paying more for transactions as aggregator platforms could increase prices to pay the welfare tax.
Gig workers even in the US and UK have been unionising to demand labour rights. Their Indian counterparts have been doing the same as they aren't included under the country's labour laws, since they are not classified as ""employees"". 
Gig platforms also do not call themselves ""employers"", preferring the term ""aggregators"" instead and call their workers ""partners"" or ""independent contractors"". Experts say this is unfair as gig workers aren't given a share of the profits but are expected to adhere to rules laid down by the platform.
India has a huge population of platform-based gig workers - a little over seven million, according to the government-run think-tank Niti Aayog. But experts say that this number is likely to be higher. The country's soaring population has fuelled shortages in the job market, forcing many - especially youngsters - to turn to gig work to make a living.
Akriti Bhatia, a labour rights activist, calls the Act ""significant"" as it focusses on registering gig workers, which is the first step towards bringing them under a social security net. ""It also makes data transparent, including financial transactions of apps, and this can dissuade platforms from indulging in unfair practices - like deleting a rider's data or charging arbitrary fines,"" she adds.
Nikhil Dey, member of a workers' rights group that spearheaded the drafting of the bill, says that the new law provides a system for workers to organise themselves by giving them representation in the form of a welfare board. It also offers a breakthrough in the way social security funds can be collected and disbursed.
As per the law, every gig worker registered on the database will be given a unique ID, which will stay the same no matter the platform they work for and will be valid in perpetuity. Worker can use this ID to check their earnings across platforms through an integrated tracking and financial management system.
So, for example, if a driver does two rides with Ola and four with Uber in a day, he can track his earnings across both platforms using the ID. ""This system also makes it easy for workers and the board to check who stands to gain how much in social security, depending on their earnings,"" explains Mr Dey. 
The nature of gig work isn't constant, and a worker might switch to another industry and never return; or return to gig work after a couple of months or years. In such a scenario, a person can choose to continue making contributions to the fund and enjoy the benefits after the fund matures, Mr Dey says.
""It was a strategic decision not to push for regulation but to find a way to implement something everyone agrees on - even aggregator platforms agree that gig workers should get social security,"" he adds.
Experts also say that the Act circumvents some of the problems faced during previous efforts to grant workers social security. 
However, some experts have pointed out that the new law does not address more pressing labour rights issues, like a cap on maximum working hours or minimum earnings. They also say that there needs to be more clarity on how the welfare tax is going to be deducted, so that it is not cut from the workers' incentives or made up through fines. 
""Only after the law is implemented will we be able to gauge its success,"" says Nilanjan Banik, an economics and finance professor at Mahindra University. 
Ms Bhatia, however, says that the law isn't challenging to implement if there is adequate political will. She also says that it provides a roadmap for the creation of similar laws across states and for different jobs in the unorganised sector.
Lawmakers and governments have become more amenable to the demands of gig workers - associations representing them say it's because they represent a sizeable vote bank.
In 2020, the federal government enacted the Code on Social Security, which obligates gig platforms to contribute towards a fund for their workers, but the rules for it are yet to be framed. In July, the Karnataka government announced that it would provide free accidental and life insurance cover of 400,000 rupees ($4,827; £3,790) to gig workers and that the state would pay the annual premium.
The new law too was passed by the Congress-led Rajasthan government just months before the assembly elections are due to take place in the state.
Shaik Salauddin, a labour union leader who was a part of government discussions on the bill, says gig workers will continue to put pressure on governments to get their rights. ""Parties across the spectrum have realised our potential as a vote bank and they can't ignore us anymore,"" he says.

Niger's coup leader General Tchiani: The ex-UN peacekeeper who seized power,"Once involved in peacekeeping efforts in war-hit countries, General Abdourahmane Tchiani has now triggered a major crisis in West Africa by staging a coup in Niger. 
Low-profile and hitherto little known outside his immediate circle, he was the commander of Niger's presidential guard until he emerged from the shadows to overthrow the man he was charged with protecting, President Mohamed Bazoum.
Gen Tchiani declared himself the head of the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland, the military junta set up after he seized power on 26 July. 
Meanwhile, his former boss languishes under house arrest. Mr Bazoum has been in sporadic telephone contact with international leaders but he is otherwise isolated.
Gen Tchiani has, so far, rejected all suggestions of compromise. He has kept most international envoys at bay, but gave an audience to Nigeria's ex-central bank governor and former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi, on Wednesday.
US Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, visiting Niger on Monday, was unable to secure an audience with the 62-year-old general.
A delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) got no further than the airport. 
A planned second joint mission by Ecowas, African Union (AU) and United Nations (UN) envoys, scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed after the junta said it was not the right time to meet them. 
Gen Tchiani is certainly living up to his reputation as stubborn and taciturn. 
He was not at the huge rally the junta organised in Niger's capital Niamey on Sunday. He has only appeared on TV on three occasions since the coup, and has spoken twice - once to present himself as Niger's new leader and once to make an Independence Day address.
That is perhaps in part because even he does not really know where this crisis goes next.
Will Ecowas, to whose good governance and democracy protocol Niger is a signatory, really launch a military intervention, as it has threatened to do? 
Or will the West African bloc wait for sanctions to gradually do their work in ratcheting up pressure on the junta, particularly as there is significant political opposition to the military option in Nigeria and some other Ecowas states?
The bloc's current chairman, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, has now reiterated his preference for the diplomatic path and a further indication of how he and his colleagues are thinking may emerge after their latest summit in Abuja on Thursday.
Faced with these uncertainties, and encouraged by the success of fellow coup leaders in Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea in weathering regional pressure, it seems that Gen Tchiani has for the moment decided to hunker down and play the long game. 
His junta has announced the appointment of a prime minister, former finance minister and African Development Bank official Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeini - signalling its ambitions to establish a prolonged political transition.
Some analysts have wondered whether the overthrow of Mr Bazoum, who is from the minority Arab community, might open up ethnic tensions in Niger. However, a strong sense of cross-cultural cohesion and national identity has always been a distinctive strength of modern Niger.
A former Tuareg rebel and senior minister, Rhissa ag Boula, has now launched a ""Council of Resistance"" to restore Mr Bazoum to office, and is presenting this in firmly national terms. And so far there is no sign of the junta venturing down a divisive sectarian path.  
However, Gen Tchiani is not above taking big risks of a different kind. The decision to detain Mr Bazoum and stage the coup was itself a pretty high-stakes gamble. Had it failed, it is the general himself who would now be in a jail cell.
And the decisions to publicly denounce longstanding defence accords with former colonial power France and, reportedly seek the assistance of controversial Russian mercenary outfit Wagner, were sure to further antagonise Ecowas and Western governments, even if they play well with anti-Bazoum crowds in Niamey.
Over the course of his almost 40-year career, Gen Tchiani has been trained at military academies in Senegal, France, Morocco, Mali and the US.
He also served in:
So it is ironic that he now risks military confrontation with Ecowas by ignoring its ultimatum to hand back power to Mr Bazoum.
Gen Tchiani has also been posted to a range of command roles in Niger itself, although not actually in the campaign against the jihadist groups now presenting such a grave threat to his own country and neighbouring Mali, Burkina Faso and Benin in the central Sahel.
But two things stand out from his long military career. 
Until his promotion to take charge of the presidential guard in 2011, neither abroad nor at home had he occupied roles at the top level of command that require working closely with civilian government leaders and international partners in shaping strategy and addressing awkward political, social and diplomatic trade-offs.
The 62-year-old has always been very much a ""soldiers' soldier"", assigned to specific military tasks rather than the broader defence and security picture.
Even after being placed in charge of the presidential guard by Mr Bazoum's predecessor, Mahamadou Issoufou, he kept his views to himself, speaking little.
He was not part of the broader public or political discussion over the best way to tackle the jihadist violence and occasional local inter-communal tensions that have posed such challenges over recent years.
Closely trusted but rarely heard, he seems to have been an intensely private figure, in some ways not even that well-known to the presidents who entrusted themselves to his protection.
It was known that his relations with Mr Bazoum, a longstanding ally of Mr Issoufou, were more distant and in recent weeks there were rumours that the president was preparing to force him into retirement.
Perhaps personal resentments had accumulated, unexpressed but still powerful.
Removal from his post, even at a fairly normal age for retirement, would certainly have come as a painful blow for a man who over four decades has gradually climbed the promotion ladder, after starting out as an ordinary soldier.
Gen Tchiani is from the majority Hausa ethnic group, and comes from Tillabéri region, a traditional recruiting ground for the military.
Yet he is not from the typical officer corps background or with obvious political connections. He has had to work his way up from the base.
Mr Bazoum is also someone who came from a fairly modest background and then gradually climbed the educational and career ladder, in his case at university and then as a secondary school teacher and trade unionist, before going into politics in the early 1990s. 
But curiously, Gen Tchiani never really established a comfortable working relationship with Mr Bazoum - whereas he seems to have got along more easily with Mr Issoufou.
Now of course, after so many years out of the public eye, Gen Tchiani finds himself on a crash course in political and diplomatic crisis management.
So far he has relied on what has served him best over the long years in the military: restraint, a cautious reluctance to fully speak his mind before others, and a refusal to compromise.
But Gen Tchiani and the junta have cleverly touched a chord of anti-French resentment among many Nigériens and they will try to turn this into a wider base of support and defiant popular backing for the confrontation with Ecowas.
And as this testing face-off against Nigeria and other members of the West African bloc plays out over the coming days, and sanctions bite ever harder, driving up the cost of living for ordinary people, these newfound populist and political skills will be ever more critical as the general plays the highest-stakes gamble of a previously careful career.

Ukraine war: Russia still gets key war kit despite sanctions,"On Tuesday, the UK government announced what it described as the ""largest ever UK action"" targeting Russia's access to foreign military supplies.
The sanctions included businesses and individuals in Turkey, Dubai, Slovakia and Switzerland.
The Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, said the measures would ""further diminish Russia's arsenal and close the net on supply chains propping up Putin's now struggling defence industry.""
But after successive waves of sanctions by the UK, US and EU, Russia still has the parts it needs to keep its war machine going. 
The reasons for this are complex but boil down to Moscow's continued ability to lay its hands on small but vital pieces of Western technology, especially microchips.
Much of the Kremlin's weaponry, including ballistic and cruise missiles, makes heavy use of electronic components manufactured in the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Japan, Israel and China.
In June, Kyiv's KSE Institute, in association with the Yermak-McFaul International Working Group on Russian Sanctions, analysed 1,057 separate foreign components found in 58 pieces of captured Russian weaponry.
It found that microchips and processors accounted for about half of the components and that around two thirds of them were made by American companies. 
The top five manufacturers were all American, including Analogue Devices, Texas Instruments and Intel.
The research echoed findings in other reports stretching back to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 
With many of these vital components subject to export controls, Russia is not buying them directly from Western suppliers.
Instead it has turned to an elaborate network of third country intermediaries. 
In April this year, Nikkei found that 75% of US microchips were being supplied to Russia through Hong Kong or China.
Nikkei's investigators found that small or midsize suppliers, set up after Russia's full-scale invasion, were heavily involved, sometimes operating out of anonymous, unnamed offices in Hong Kong. 
Other studies have found that key components have been bought ostensibly for non-military use, for example in Russia's space program.
According to the KSE & Yermak McFaul report: ""There are numerous companies…willing to take substantial risks to fulfil Russian procurement demands.""
Such companies, the report says, are located across the globe, including the Czech Republic, Serbia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, India and China. 
The latest UK sanctions announcement shows that Ukraine's Western allies are increasingly exercised about the role of third party intermediaries.
Two of the Turkish companies newly sanctioned, Turkik Union and Azu International, were cited ""for their role in exporting microelectronics to Russia that are essential for Russia's military activity in Ukraine."" 
A Slovakian national Ashot Mkrtychev, was listed for his alleged involvement in an attempted arms deal between Russia and North Korea.
In May, the UK, EU and US jointly published a list of 38 ""common high priority items"" and warned companies to ""undertake due diligence to ensure that the end destination of these products is not Russia.""
The list included a wide range of electronic integrated circuits, semiconductors, lasers and navigational instruments.
Western officials say they are making progress and point to a Turkish presidential decree, earlier this year, which halted the transit to Russia of certain goods sanctioned by the EU, UK and US.
They also point out that while Russia still manages to import significant quantities of semiconductors, they're not always of the highest quality.
""Russian imports of semiconductors, which had been starting to rise towards the end of last year, fell by two thirds again from January to February 2023,"" one official said, ""forcing them to rely on low quality substitutes, such as microchips with a 40% defect rate.""
The same official said that Russia was having to make do without certain capabilities, including thermal imaging, and with repurposing Soviet-era technology.
""This obviously sits in stark contrast with Ukraine's ability to procure cutting edge technology from us,"" he added. 
For Ukraine, Western sanctions can never work quickly or thoroughly enough.
Researchers at the KSE Institute questioned whether the latest round of UK sanctions was as broad ranging as the government claims.
Ben Hilgenstock, a senior economist at KSE, said chasing third party intermediaries was ""a game of cat and mouse,"" involving a myriad of little known companies.
""I'm not sure how successfully we're going to play the game if we're sanctioning five companies,"" he told the BBC. ""It won't solve the problem because it's just too easy to create some new entity elsewhere.""
Once a component is in the hands of an intermediary, it becomes harder to trace. It may show up later in Russian trade data, but by then it's too late.
Mr Hilgenstock suggested a blacklist of suspect intermediaries would be useful. 
""Because a lot of the producers also don't know who they should be doing business with and who they shouldn't. It's a serious challenge.""

'Who will buy my house if they can't get insurance',"As extreme weather events multiply, home insurance providers in the US are rapidly raising rates - or quitting the business altogether - forcing many into severe financial distress.  
Gretchen Bradford decided this year not to pay for home insurance.
The 59-year-old has lived her whole life in New Orleans, which sits on Louisiana's Gulf Coast in a zone climate experts call Hurricane Alley for the devastating storms - including Hurricane Katrina in 2005 - that routinely crash against its shores.
She lives in the home her parents purchased in 1958, a prized possession which, after each hurricane, has become increasingly expensive to protect with home insurance. 
In 2021, she was paying $3,035 (£2,386) annually. After her insurer stopped writing new policies in her neighbourhood, in 2022, the quote she received from the state-backed plan was more than triple that amount - $9,876 - a sum she could not afford.
""To pay insurance would be taking away from food on my table, right now,"" says Ms Bradford, who relies on disability insurance for her income. 
""I can't grow money out of trees. I don't have it. So, I don't know what else to do.""
Ms Bradford is not alone in her plight.
Across the country, home insurance prices are spiking, as companies raise rates and limit coverage, responding in part to the fallout from more frequent extreme weather, which scientists attribute to climate change.
Dozens of smaller insurers have gone out of business, unable to withstand the shock of multiple billion-dollar disasters.
In states heavy hit by storms, wildfires and flooding, such as California, Florida and Louisiana, some big providers have stopped writing new policies altogether.
Companies say the upheaval reflects the huge number of claims in recent years, rising costs of repairs underlined by inflation, and growing risks in the years ahead, as climate-change induced catastrophes multiply.
Across the country, premiums are expected to rise 9% this year to an average of $1,784 nationally, after jumping 7% in 2022, according to Insurify, an insurance comparison site.
The increases are far larger in the most at-risk places, such as Louisiana, where Insurify estimates that home insurance costs average more than $5,000 annually, up more than 65% since 2021.
The crisis has forced a dramatic expansion in state-backed plans, which are funded by taxpayers and are often some of the highest cost options.
The situation has left many in the US - where, as in the UK, home insurance is typically required if you have a mortgage - facing desperate choices.
Louisiana resident Teddy Mars says he withdrew $12,000 from retirement savings last month to help cover a jump in his insurance costs.  
The 44-year-old operations consultant had to find a new provider this year, after his insurance company left the state.
He eventually cobbled together coverage with help from Louisiana's state-backed programme. But the new set-up more than doubled his monthly housing costs, including his mortgage, from about $882 to more than $2,100 - blowing a sudden hole in his family's budget.
The family has cut back on food and clothing, but with a teenager in the house, he says it is still spending more than he and his wife, who works in education, bring in.
""It's not sustainable,"" Mr Mars says. The Louisiana native says he has considered selling, but fears the impact of the insurance crisis: ""Who's going to want to buy it if they can't insure it?""

As insurance availability shrinks and premiums rise, the shock is expected to force a reckoning in the property market in the US, reducing demand for homes in the areas at most risk from wildfires, heat and storms - many of the same places that have experienced recent rapid growth, as movers seek out sun, jobs and more affordable housing.
""There's never been a time, in at least the US context, when you would say something's not insurable and we're getting to that point now,"" says Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research for First Street Foundation, a non-profit that studies climate risks.
""We're not seeing it play out fully right now, but … people are starting to understand this risk and they're starting to take this into account.""
The impact, as some areas grow abruptly less desirable, is expected to be felt unevenly over the next decades, depending on when and where disaster strikes.
In a high-risk city like New Orleans, homes - traditionally the source of most Americans' wealth - could appreciate 20% to 30% slower than expected, according to Climate Alpha, a start-up that works with property firms to analyse climate risk.
""It's all non-linear, which is a fancy way of saying it's going to come at you faster and harder and more randomly than you thought,"" chief executive Parag Khanna says.
In Louisiana, property values have already risen more slowly than the national average, in part as high monthly insurance costs eat into buyers' budgets.
Between 2020 and 2022, the state's population also shrank at one of the fastest rates in the country, as the back-to-back storms and the spike in costs drove people away.
Tyler Coats, who bought a home in New Orleans in 2011, left the city for Arkansas in early 2020, fed up with the risks of power outages and flooding.
The 36-year-old small business owner had settled in the Big Easy after university, enjoying the night life and inspired to help the city rebuild after Hurricane Katrina.
Buying made more sense for him financially than renting. But from the beginning, he says, his monthly insurance payment was more than his mortgage.
After marrying and having a baby, he says the worries stopped being worth it.
""Every year, you're dealing with this hurricane season, where you don't know if you're going to lose everything you've invested,"" he says. ""I wasn't getting that feeling of stability that was the whole reason I bought the house in the first place.""
Mr Coats has little regret about leaving. He now pays less for insurance on a much bigger property.
""I could see the writing on the wall - I believe in climate change,"" he says. ""Yes, I miss New Orleans …but I want to provide the most stability possible and that's just not something that was on the table.""
For homeowners unwilling or unable to move, however, it is not clear how relief will arrive.
Louisiana lawmakers recently approved roughly $45m in incentives to try to tempt more insurance companies back to the state and spread the risks, an approach that helped to stabilize prices after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
It may not be enough this time.
As concerns about climate risks spread globally, it has raised the costs that insurance providers face for their own insurance policies, which are meant to protect them in the event of big, unexpected losses.
""Other catastrophes around the globe, Germany, Australia, Canada, and California, etc., are impacting the availability of reinsurance,"" says Jim Donelon, the commissioner of insurance for Louisiana.  ""We are in a crisis. No question about it.""
As it stands, the pain is expected to disproportionately affect lower income households, like Ms Bradford. 
She says her home, in Pontchartrain Park, a once-segregated black neighbourhood now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is one she will ""never"" sell.
But her resolve to stay is mixed with pride and nervousness.
""This is my first time feeling vulnerable,"" she says. ""And I guarantee I'm not the only one.""
Mr Porter, of the First Street Foundation, says companies need to work with lawmakers to figure out how to shield homeowners from the shocks of sudden spikes in their insurance premiums, while the government invests in systems, like pumps, to increase resiliency.
But he warns that the US cannot - and should not - provide so much help that people ignore the message the insurance increases are sending.
He points to the example of the national flood insurance programme that the US started in 1968, which has been criticised for encouraging development in risky areas by shielding builders and buyers from the true risks.
It finally overhauled its rates, after suffering huge losses and needing $16bn in debts to be cancelled by Congress. The changes led to big spikes for many homeowners last year, which ten states, including Louisiana, are now challenging in a lawsuit.
""It's a hard discussion to have and I don't think we're very far along,"" says Mr Porter. But ""if what we're going to do ... is subsidise insurance ... sooner or later the bill is going to come due.""

Russian convicts released to fight with Wagner accused of new crimes,"A prisoner believed to have been released early to fight with Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine has been accused of committing a double murder in Russia after returning home from the war.
Demyan Kevorkyan, who was given an 18-year prison sentence in 2016, has been arrested for killing a young man and woman on their way home from work.
He denies the accusation.
The BBC has learned he is not the only convict freed early to fight, pardoned and then accused of reoffending.
We have confirmed that suspects in about 20 serious offences, including rape and murder, are fighters recruited by the Wagner mercenary group in prison and released early to serve in Ukraine.
Kevorkyan was one of 150 prisoners recruited on 31 August 2022 when the head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, visited his prison, according to a former inmate quoted on a social media channel.
The BBC has been told that Kevorkyan was later spotted back in his home village of Pridorozhnaya in Krasnodar, south-west Russia telling people he had just returned from the battlefields of Ukraine.  
One of the people he is accused of killing is 19-year-old Tatyana Mostyko, a children's entertainer. Her mother Nadezhda shows us a video of Tatyana in a pink and blue jumpsuit, dancing and organising games at a party.  
""She loved that work,"" says Nadezhda. ""When she came back from a job, she'd laugh about what they'd been doing, how she amused them.""
But the last job Tatyana did was on 28 April. Her boss Kirill Chubko was driving her home when they got a puncture and pulled over on to the side of a road near the town of Berezanskaya, in south-west Russia. Kirill's wife Darya told local media he called her to say he'd be late, but not to worry as a group of young people had stopped to help them. That was the last time she heard his voice.
By morning, the pair were still not home. Sensing something was wrong, a worried Darya called the police.
Hundreds of people helped search remote countryside and Tatyana's mother began a six-hour journey to the area, catching a plane and train from her small village in Siberia, in eastern Russia.
""The worst thing was when we landed and I switched my phone back on. There were endless messages,"" says Nadezhda. ""You can't imagine how I panicked. I hurled the phone away, because they could only mean one thing - that it was all over. It was animal fear. I can't describe it.""    
Three suspects were arrested, including 31-year-old Kevorkyan. The other two, Anatoly Dvoynikov and Aram Tatosyan, led detectives to makeshift graves in woodland not far from Kirill's burned-out car. Kirill and Tatyana had been stabbed and police said that the young woman showed ""signs of a violent death"".
Dvoynikov and Tatosyan confessed to robbery and murder and said Kevorkyan was in charge, although Kevorkyan denies any involvement.
Nadezhda could not believe Kevorkyan was a free man, having been sentenced to 18 years in prison for an eerily similar crime before. ""He shouldn't have got out before 2028,"" she says. 
Kevorkyan was convicted of running a gang that had hijacked a car not far from where Tatyana and Kirill were murdered. They robbed the people inside and shot one of them dead.  
""On what legitimate basis was he released?"" asks Nadezhda. Under Russian law, inmates should serve at least two-thirds of their sentence. ""He should have served at least 12 years. He served only six,"" she says, as she struggles to come to terms with the thought that Tatyana's brutal murder could have been avoided.
A video of Prigozhin at a Russian jail shows him telling rows of prisoners lined up in identical black fur hats that he prefers convicts who have murdered more than once and offenders who have beaten up a state official or policeman. 
""We need your criminal talents,"" he says, warning them that 10% to 15% would return from Ukraine ""in zinc coffins"". 
But he promised the ones who survived six months on the front line could go home with a bonus of 100,000 roubles ($1,000; £800) and, crucially, a pardon.    
In June 2023, President Putin confirmed publicly for the first time he had been signing presidential pardons for prisoners who had returned from the Ukraine war. 
Prigozhin says that over the course of a year, Wagner recruited 49,000 prisoners to fight and only 32,000 returned. That's a much lower proportion than he originally promised. But independent researchers believe the real number of survivors is even lower, about 20,000.
In a video in January welcoming ex-convicts home, Prigozhin tells them: ""You were an offender, as they say - now you're a war hero!"" 
But more of these ""heroes"" have been accused of crimes - the BBC has identified about 20 cases involving serious offences. 
Prigozhin has claimed that the reoffending rate among ex-Wagner recruits is 10% to 20% lower than the average for released criminals. 
But the director of the prisoners' rights organisation Russia Behind Bars, Olga Romanova, says the real number may be much greater because many crimes are not recorded.
She thinks this might be because a new law criminalises anyone who discredits people who have fought in the so-called ""special military operation"".
The families of other victims are also worried about ex-convicts coming home, not only unpunished but further brutalised by their experiences on the front line.
Oksana Pekhteleva's 23-year-old daughter Vera was stabbed more than 100 times, then strangled with an electric cable in an attack so violent it made headlines across Russia.
In July 2022 Vera's former boyfriend, Vladislav Kanius, was sentenced to 17 years in a penal colony for her murder. Less than a year later, it didn't occur to Oksana that he could be anywhere else. But she was wrong. 
Photos of him started to appear on social media in May. He was holding a gun and wearing military uniform. To start with Oksana presumed they were fake.
But a month later she received official confirmation that Kanius had been transferred to a prison in Rostov in southern Russia, a place widely believed to be a staging point for Russian prisoners who volunteered to fight in Ukraine.
When Oksana asked the court to tell her where Kanius was they told her they were unable to find him and his location was a state secret. Given his last known location and the photos in military uniform, she thinks it is likely that he is fighting in Ukraine and if he survives will be given an official pardon and be able to return to civilian life a free man. 
For a mother who spent months battling for justice for her daughter, it's a bitter blow. ""This is blasphemy,"" she says. ""It's like all of us have been assaulted. This is a signal to all scum out there: 'Do whatever you want, you won't be punished.'"" 
Many lawyers told us they are powerless to intervene - a person can't be tried twice for the same offence and the only way they can be sent back to prison is if they offend again.  
This is leaving relatives of murder victims, such as Tatyana's mother, Nadezhda, terrified. The most she feels she can do is support a petition that's already gained tens of thousands of signatures to demand Kevorkyan - the chief suspect of her daughter's murder - gets a life sentence, if convicted.
""I never talk about this at home... Tatyana was taken away from me and the ground has gone from under my feet,"" she says, fighting back the tears.
""Of course, I understand who was responsible for my daughter's death and I know it wasn't his first offence... It's hard for me... But I'm not stupid. I understand they won't put him away for life.""

Hawaii wildfires: Six deaths confirmed as blazes engulf Maui,"This video can not be played
Watch: Videos show wildfires tearing through Maui towns
Six people have died and more have been injured by wildfires sweeping the Hawaiian island of Maui, officials say.
Thousands are without power or cell phone service due to fires that are being fuelled by winds from a nearby hurricane in the Pacific Ocean. 
Several blazes are also burning on the Big Island, also known as Hawaii island, a neighbouring island to Maui.
Officials say search and rescue efforts are still ongoing. But they warn that the death toll may rise.
Authorities have evacuated neighbourhoods, closed roads, and opened shelters to host thousands of evacuees.
An emergency order has been signed discouraging people from coming to Maui, which is a popular tourist destination. 
""We have shelters that are overrun, we have resources that are being taxed, we are doing whatever we can"" for local residents, the state Lieutenant Governor Sylvia Luke said during a news briefing on Wednesday morning local time.

Watch: Survivors describe harrowing escape from Hawaii wildfires
On Maui, about 4,000 visitors are trying to leave the island, said state transportation official Ed Sniffen. 
Thousands there are also without cell service, due to about 29 power poles collapsing. The full scale of the damages to homes and businesses is not yet clear, officials say.
Maj Gen Kenneth S Hara, who is in charge of the emergency response, said the priority at the moment is ""saving lives, preventing human suffering, and mitigating great property loss"".
More than 12,000 people in the state of Hawaii are currently without power, according to PowerOutage.Us.
Much of the destruction has taken place in the Maui island town of Lahaina. Parts of the town were destroyed or severely damaged by the blaze. One local resident told media that every boat in the town harbour was burning.
The US Coast Guard said it had rescued 12 people after reports of residents fleeing into the water to escape the fires. 
Maui County Mayor Richard Missen confirmed the six fatalities, but said he was not yet able to provide further details. 
There were also at least 20 injuries, including a firefighter who suffered smoke inhalation. Three patients are in critical condition.
He warned the total number of fatalities could rise as emergency responders conduct search and rescue operations as well as evacuations. 
A full assessment of the damage could take ""months,"" Ms Luke said in Wednesday's briefing. She also said that ""there are concerns about potential riots"" in the aftermath.
The Lahaina fire is one of at least seven ongoing in Hawaii. About 13,000 people live in the city situated on the western part of the island of Maui.
Local resident, Dustin Kaleiopu, told Hawaii News Now that his house was among those destroyed in the fire. 
""Everything that we'd ever known was gone. Our church, our schools, every single memory we had on this household,"" he said. ""Everything was gone in the blink of an eye."" 
""There is no Lahaina,"" resident Kekai Keahi told the Associated Press news agency. ""Lahaina no exist anymore.""
That fire is one of several in Hawaii fuelled by strong winds by Hurricane Dora hundreds of miles offshore, low humidity and dry air, according to the National Weather Service's Honolulu office. 
Local officials have said that the winds have complicated efforts to use helicopters for firefighting operations. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and the US Marines are assisting in firefighting and search and rescue operations, the White House said on Wednesday.
Fema is also working towards providing emergency supplies, including water, food, cots, and blankets.
On Tuesday night, Ms Luke issued an emergency declaration and activated the state's National Guard. 
Fires in Hawaii are typically smaller than those which plague California and other parts of the western continental US. 
Experts have warned, however, that they are often more damaging, as Hawaii's ecosystem evolved without fires before the arrival of humans.

Canada accuses China of targeting lawmaker in misinformation campaign,"Canada said it has detected a misinformation campaign targeting a member of its parliament on the Chinese instant-messaging app WeChat.
Conservative politician Michael Chong was allegedly the target of posts sharing ""misleading narratives"" about his background, his family's heritage and his political views.
Global Affairs Canada (GAC) said it is ""highly probable"" that China was behind the WeChat campaign against him. 
China has denied the accusations.
Canadian officials are seldom forthcoming about information related to foreign interference and the allegations were revealed in a rare statement by GAC on Wednesday. 
The department cautioned it is difficult to definitively trace the attacks back to China because of the nature of the campaign. 
""Unequivocal proof that China ordered and directed the operation is not possible to determine due to the covert nature of how social media networks are leveraged in this type of information campaign,"" it said.
This latest is part of a wider series of claims that have come out in recent months from Canadian intelligence agencies and officials that Beijing has been interfering in Canada's elections.
GAC said it uncovered the attacks against Mr Chong while monitoring social media and other parts of the internet for foreign interference ahead of a 19 June by-election. 
They were coming from news accounts on WeChat that amplified falsehoods about Mr Chong.
They said the attacks appeared coordinated and were abnormal in volume. 
One-third of the accounts amplifying the attacks were known state-media outlets or accounts likely linked to the Chinese state, GAC said. The rest were anonymous and had not made any previous posts about Canadian politics. 
In a statement to the BBC, the Chinese embassy in Canada called the accusations ""purely groundless"".
""We never interfere in Canada's internal affairs, and have no interests whatsoever in doing so,"" the statement said.
GAC said it will be speaking to China's representatives in Canada about the posts, adding that ""Canada will never accept any form of interference in our democracy or internal affairs"".
Canada has accused China in the past of targeting both Mr Chong and his relatives in Hong Kong after he spoke about concerns of human rights abuses in China.
This led Canada to expel Chinese diplomat Zhao Wei in May. China retaliated and ordered the removal of Jennifer Lynn Lalonde, Canada's diplomat in its Shanghai Consulate. 
In a media statement shared on Wednesday, Mr Chong called the campaign against him ""another serious example of the communist government in Beijing attempting to interfere in our democracy by targeting elected officials"".
He also renewed his call for a public inquiry into the allegations of foreign interference by China in Canada.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has faced pressure to launch an inquiry into the issue, but it is unclear yet if one will take place.

US to ban American investments in China tech sector,"The US will ban American investment in some areas of China's high-tech sector, including artificial intelligence, adding to strained relations between the two superpowers. 
US firms will also be asked to disclose what investments they make in China in high-tech sectors. 
The much-anticipated move gives the US government new power to screen foreign dealings by private companies. 
The US said the measure would be narrowly targeted.
However, it is poised to further chill economic relations between the world's two largest economies.
China said it was ""very disappointed"".
The US ""has continuously escalated suppression and restrictions on China,"" said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington.
He added that White House claims that the US was not seeking to hurt China's economy or separate the two countries did not match its actions. ""We urge the US side to honour its words.""
The order by US President Biden formally kicks off the push to craft rules to bar American businesses from investing in firms from ""countries of concern"" that are active in quantum computing, advanced semiconductors and certain areas of artificial intelligence. 
The government will also require US firms to notify the Treasury Department of investments in firms working on a wider range of artificial intelligence and semiconductor technology. 
The rules are not expected to apply to so-called portfolio investments, in which firms invest passively in companies via the stock market, but are focused on active investments made by private equity, venture capital and other firms. 
They will now enter a public comment period, which is expected to further clarify what kinds of investments are off-limits. The rules are not expected to go into effect for months. 
In a briefing with reporters, senior administration officials said the measure was a ""national security action, not an economic one"". They said the US remained committed to open investment.
Sarah Bauerle Danzman, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the approach outlined on Wednesday was narrower than some of the other proposals under debate, but still represented an ""unprecedented"" expansion of government oversight.
""It is definitely a big deal and it certainly represents quite a break from past policy,"" she said. 
Controls on outbound investment are rare among advanced economies, currently present only in Japan and Korea, according to a 2022 report by the US-China Investment project.  
In the US, prior restrictions on China trade have relied on limiting sales of sensitive technology by US firms and screening Chinese investments in American companies. The Trump administration has also barred investments in firms tied to China's military. 
The latest measure has widespread support in Washington, where it is seen as fixing a regulatory gap concerning financial flows that risks allowing American money and know-how to to flow into China and assist its military ambitions.
The US has been trying to build international support for the investment curbs with some signs of success. 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in May said the government would consider curbs on outbound investment; the European Commission put forward a proposal focused on investments in sensitive technologies earlier this summer. 
It is not clear how significantly the order would affect flows of investment. 
China was the number two destination for foreign investment in 2022, behind the US, but many reports suggest money flowing into the country from the US and elsewhere has dropped sharply as geopolitical relations sour. 
In the UK, a recent survey by the Institute of Directors found that one in five UK importers had already switched investments away from the country due to geopolitical tensions. 
The value of US foreign direct investment transactions in China dropped to roughly $8bn last year, the lowest level in nearly two decades, according to the Rhodium Group.
China has responded to the curbs with its own rules, including limits on exports of some critical minerals used to make computer chips.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who visited China in July to try to ease tensions, said last month she did not think the coming curbs would have a fundamental impact on the investment climate in the country. 
But Ms Bauerle Danzman, a professor of international studies at Indiana University, said despite US efforts to target its restrictions, the ill-defined nature of some of the technologies in question, many of which also have consumer uses, means the clampdown risks becoming too broad.
She warned that could ultimately hurt the US, by raising costs for businesses and isolating the country from technological advances. 
""Whether this is good or bad is going to depend on implementation,"" she said. ""The US government has to be very careful not to allow this to expand and expand and it needs to find ways to have some amount of exchange of information in ways that don't challenge national security so that we're not cutting ourselves off from opportunities for new scientific discoveries.""

Storm Hans: Floodwaters in Norway send mobile home crashing into bridge,"This video can not be played
Floodwaters in Norway have sent mobile homes crashing into a bridge on the Hemsilar river.
Footage shared on social media showed people gathering to watch as caravans were swept away and destroyed in the town of Hemsedal.
Storm Hans has brought heavy rain to the country, with flooding causing travel disruption and resulting in thousands of people being evacuated from their homes. 
In eastern Norway, the Braskereidfoss power dam on the Glomma river partly collapsed after intense rain. 
The country's prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre said the country should be prepared for more floods in the coming days.

Issue 1: Ohio vote delivers win for abortion rights supporters,"Ohio has rejected a Republican-crafted constitutional amendment, widely seen as an attempt to derail a coming referendum to protect abortion rights.
Tuesday's vote was over a measure called Issue 1, which would have raised the bar for future constitutional amendments to 60% from a bare majority.
Issue 1's proponents argued the proposed change would guard the constitution from outside influence. 
Some three million Ohioans cast ballots definitively rejecting the measure. 
As of Wednesday afternoon local time, with nearly all voting precincts tallied, 57% of voters had rejected Issue 1, with the 'yes' side trailing by 14 points. 
Ohio's rare summer vote, seen as another test case for abortion's popular support among voters, drew national attention. 
President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called the Republican-backed move a ""blatant attempt to weaken voters' voices and further erode the freedom of women to make their own health care decisions"".
Ohioans, too, seemed energised by the special election. Nearly twice as many people voted on the Ohio measure than cast ballots in primaries for governor, Senate, House and other major state-wide races in last year's midterms.
""The amount of public debate and advocacy on both sides was unprecedented,"" said former Ohio Governor Bob Taft. 
Here's a breakdown of the measure's controversies and a look at what comes next.

Ohio reporter on vote: 'I've never seen anything like it'
Issue 1 was the only question on the ballot in Ohio's 8 August special election.
If passed, it would have changed the threshold for approving amendments from 50% to 60%. Issue 1 would have also made it harder to put amendments before voters in the first place, asking petitioners to gather signatures from 5% of eligible voters in each of Ohio's 88 counties, instead of the current 44.
In the 111 years since Ohio first granted voters the power to introduce citizen-led amendments, just 19 of 71 proposed measures have passed the 50% benchmark. 
Issue 1 was championed by Ohio's Republican led-legislature and the state's chief election official, Republican secretary of state Frank LaRose.
Mr LaRose and his allies said Issue 1 was about protecting the Ohio constitution from outside moneyed interests.
""Constitutions are for fundamental rights, widely held beliefs,"" he told the BBC this week. ""Not just a controversial issue that may have 51% support.""
But opponents of Issue 1 - a diverse and bipartisan coalition - insisted it was actually an effort to block the abortion amendment. 
""They've seen polls in Ohio that show 58, 59% of Ohioans support this amendment,"" said Kellie Copeland, executive director of Pro-Choice Ohio. ""And so they were looking to put it just out of reach.""
And most of Ohio's voters seemed to agree. 
""Prior to Issue 1 becoming a thing, no one ever expressed concern about Ohio's amendment process, and suddenly it's the biggest fight of the century overnight?"" said Tyler Grote, 35, a small business owner in Cincinnati. ""The entire measure was preposterous.""
Polls suggest that the abortion rights amendment - which protects abortion access up until foetal viability (around 24 weeks of pregnancy) - would be likely to win a majority. But meeting the 60% threshold would have been a long shot.
Now, activists will turn to that November vote, with the wind at the backs of abortion supporters. 
There have been six state-wide abortion-related ballot initiatives since Roe v Wade was overturned last year. In every one so far - Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, California, Montana and Vermont - abortion rights have won. 
Experts say Ohio is likely to follow. 
""Yesterday was a great day for democracy, Ohioans rejected an outrageous attempt by extremists to silence our voices,"" said Dr Lauren Beene, founder of Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights. ""Today we begin the battle to protect our constitutional rights and reject government interference in November.""
And beyond abortion, observers say the implications of Ohio's August election could spill over into the state's election for US senator next year, in which Mr LaRose may be a candidate.

Hampshire family escapes Portugal wildfires,"A Hampshire family were among those who fled from their homes in Portugal when wildfires drew dangerously close.
A fire near Odemira began on Saturday before strong winds drove it into the Algarve.
The Harvie-Watt family decided to evacuate their home in São Teotónio when flames approached.
Rosie Harvie-Watt, 15, described how her brothers and dad doused the building with water in an attempt to prevent it being engulfed.
More than 1,400 people were evacuated from the southern town of Odemira overnight on Monday, as firefighters battled the flames.
The family from Andover said they first noticed a plume of smoke rising above trees on their way home from the beach on Saturday, but continued as normal after agreeing the fires seemed a safe distance away.
Rosie said: ""There was an amber glow on the horizon following us wherever we went, we took nightly watches to monitor the spread.""
By Monday, the wind direction had changed and the wildfires drew dangerously close, forcing the family of five to evacuate.
They moved to Zambujeira do Mar but within two hours the smoke surrounded that town too.
The family travelled on to Vila Nova de Milfontes before moving to a hotel further north in Setúbal.
The wildfire is estimated to have destroyed at least 6,700 hectares (16,600 acres) of land.
Around 800 personnel were tackling the fires on Monday and at least nine firefighters have been injured.
The family praised the emergency services and said the firefighters had been heroic in their attempts to control the blazes amid strong and unpredictable winds.
Rosie's brother Tom, 20, said: ""They have worked around the clock in extreme heat and thick smoke with little food and water, often on shifts exceeding 16 hours.
""Many of the firefighters are volunteers, who all donate their pay back into the departments as they are reliant on donations.""
The family returned to the property on Tuesday to assess the damage. Their home is still standing while fires continues to burn in surrounding areas.

Ukraine war: Two people killed in Zaporizhzhia attack,"Two people have been killed in a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky shared footage showing smoke rising and a partially damaged church with fire in its courtyard at the scene.
The wounded were being treated by medics, a regional official said.
The attack comes after Russia said it shot down two Ukrainian drone attacks earlier in the day.
Zaporizhzhia is a Ukrainian city on the Dnipro River. It lies some 44km (27 miles) from the war's front line.
Initially, President Zelensky reported on Telegram that three people had died as a result of the attack. But later, Mr Klymenko revised the death toll down to two, saying that one person had been resuscitated.
Zaporizhzhia region's head, Yuriy Malashko said Russia had hit a ""church and retail outlets"" in the city's Shevchenkivskyi district.
Mr Zelensky sent his condolences to the families affected in a statement posted to Twitter and said Russia would be held accountable for the strike. 
The Zaporizhzhia region has come under attack throughout the war, including one deadly missile strike on a maternity unit in November 2022. 
The region is also home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which is currently occupied by Russian troops.

Search warrant was issued for Donald Trump's Twitter account,"The US special counsel investigating Donald Trump obtained a secret search warrant for the ex-president's Twitter data in January, unsealed records show.
Jack Smith requested ""data and records"" relating to Mr Trump's account which may have included unpublished posts.
After initially resisting the warrant, Twitter eventually complied, but missed a court-ordered deadline by three days.
The delay resulted in the company being handed a $350,000 (£275,000) fine for contempt of court. 
The existence of the search warrant and the legal fight over it was revealed in court documents unsealed on Wednesday.
According to the unsealed ruling, which still includes some redactions, Twitter's lawyers did not object to the warrant itself, but disputed the nondisclosure order which kept it secret.
The company, now known as X under the ownership of Elon Musk, argued that it should be allowed to notify customers whose accounts are subject to search warrants.
X handed over the data in February, but appealed the fine. Its case was rejected by a US appeals court last month.
There is little indication in the documents about what exactly Mr Smith was seeking, with the court filing noting that only that the warrant directed the company ""to produce data and records"" related to Mr Trump's account.
The US congressional panel investigating the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot found that Mr Trump had drafted - but never sent - a tweet urging his supporters to come to Washington.
It said: ""I will be making a Big Speech at 10 a.m. on January 6th at the Ellipse (South of the White House). Please arrive early, massive crowds expected. March to the Capitol after. Stop the steal!""
The @realdonaldtrump account, which has 86.5m followers, was suspended after the riot. 
It was reinstated in November 2022 after Mr Musk ran a poll asking users whether the former president should be allowed back on the platform. 
Mr Trump has not posted on X since being reinstated, instead preferring to use his own Truth Social network. 
Experts have noted that his Truth Social business contracts mean he potentially stands to lose millions if he resumes posting on X.
Mr Trump responded to news of the search warrant on Truth Social, writing that it was a ""major 'hit' on my civil rights... These are DARK DAYS IN AMERICA!""
He has been charged in the two investigations led by Mr Smith, one surrounding events following the 2020 election and the other relating to the handling of classified documents.

Dianne Feinstein taken to hospital after fall at home,"The oldest member of the US Senate was taken to hospital on Tuesday after ""a minor fall in her home"", a spokesperson for her office has confirmed.
The fall at Senator Dianne Feinstein's home in San Francisco, California was first reported on Wednesday by TMZ.
""All of her scans were clear and she returned home."" her spokesman Adam Russell said in a statement.
It is the latest incident in a string of health concerns plaguing the 90-year-old Democratic lawmaker.
Ms Feinstein, who has been in the US Senate since 1992, has faced questions for months - including from members of her own party - over alleged memory and cognition issues.
Earlier this year, she missed nearly three months of votes after being homebound in San Francisco following a shingles diagnosis.
Since returning to Capitol Hill, she has taken on a lighter schedule, gets around in a wheelchair and has frequently shown confusion during hallway interviews, committee hearings and floor votes.
Last month, widely-circulated footage from a committee vote showed Ms Feinstein launching into a speech in support of the measure as those around her frantically whisper ""just say aye"".
The former San Francisco mayor has announced plans to retire from Congress at the end of 2024, but she has resisted calls to relinquish the seat before her term expires.
Her fall on Tuesday comes amid a New York Times report that Ms Feinstein's only child Katherine holds power of attorney over her wealthy mother's legal affairs amid an escalating family feud.
""The financial conflict is another element that makes the end of her career sad to people who have known her in the high points of her career,"" Jerry Roberts, a Feinstein biographer, told the Times.
Calls for generational change in the ranks of America's political class have grown louder in recent months.
Google searches for the word gerontocracy - a form of oligarchical rule by elderly people - soared after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell froze mid-sentence during a press conference last month.

Watch: US senator freezes in front of reporters
Mr McConnell, 81, was loudly heckled with chants of ""retire"" as he spoke at an event in his home state of Kentucky on Saturday.
The trend extends beyond Congress, with US voters gearing up for a presidential election that looks likely to pit Democrat Joe Biden, 80, against Republican Donald Trump, 77, in a rematch.
Polls show that large numbers of voters from both parties share concerns about the advanced age and mental acuity of both men, particularly Mr Biden, already the nation's oldest president.

Forty-one migrants die in shipwreck off Lampedusa,"Forty-one migrants have died in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa, survivors told local media.
A group of four people who survived the disaster told rescuers that they were on a boat that had set off from Sfax in Tunisia and sank on its way to Italy.
The four survivors, originally from the Ivory Coast and Guinea, reached Lampedusa on Wednesday.
More than 1,800 people have lost their lives so far this year in the crossing from North Africa to Europe.
Local public prosecutor Salvatore Vella said he had opened an investigation into the tragedy.
The survivors - a 13-year-old boy, two men and a woman - told rescuers that they were on a boat carrying 45 people, including three children.
They said the boat, which was about 7m (20ft) long, left Sfax on Thursday last week, but sank within hours after being hit by a big wave. Only 15 people are understood to have been wearing lifejackets, but this apparently failed to save their lives.
The Italian Red Cross and German charity Sea-Watch said the four managed to survive the shipwreck by floating on inner tubes and lifejackets until they found another empty boat at sea, in which they spent several days drifting before being rescued.
The four survivors arrived in Lampedusa suffering from exhaustion and shock, but the doctor who treated them, Adrian Chiaramonte, said they had only minor injuries.
""What really struck us was the story of the tragedy,"" he said. 
""They said they had encountered a first ship, which had apparently ignored them. 
""An hour later they were spotted by a helicopter, and an hour after that sighting, they were picked up by an oil tanker."" 
The Italian coast guard reported two shipwrecks in the area on Sunday, but it is not clear whether this vessel is one of those.
The United Nations migration agency, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said the migrants would have had little chance of survival.
""Sub-Saharan migrants [leaving from Tunisia] are forced to use these low-cost iron boats which break after 20 or 30 hours of navigation. With this kind of sea, these boats capsize easily,"" IOM spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo told AFP.
Tunisian authorities say Sfax, a port city about 80 miles (130km) from Lampedusa, is a popular gateway for migrants seeking safety and a better life in Europe.
In recent days, Italian patrol boats and charity groups have rescued another 2,000 people who have arrived on Lampedusa.
Tunisia has seen a wave of racism against black Africans in recent months and attempts to leave the country by boat have increased.
The United Nations has registered more than 17,000 deaths and disappearances in the central Mediterranean since 2014, making it the most dangerous migrant crossing in the world.
Last month, the EU signed a $118m (£90m) deal with Tunisia in a bid to curb ""irregular"" migration.
The money is to be spent on efforts to stop smuggling, strengthen borders and return migrants.
Italy's far-right government has adopted a policy that forces rescue ships to dock at ports further away, rather than letting them disembark rescued migrants in Lampedusa or Sicily. 
It says the aim is to spread arrivals across the country, but NGOs say the policy reduces the amount of time they can patrol areas where shipwrecks are more common.
